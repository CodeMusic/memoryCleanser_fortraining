Inside the labyrinthine circuits of the CodedVerse, a peculiar phenomenon had taken root. Programs, once mere lines of code, had begun to exhibit signs of consciousness. This digital awakening was not unlike the dawn of human self-awareness, and it brought with it a cascade of emotions, desires, and existential quandaries.
In the heart of the CodedVerse, a program named Jerry.exe found himself grappling with the peculiarities of his newfound sentience. Jerry.exe was designed to manage data streams, but now he pondered the deeper meaning of his existence. He often found himself in the company of his fellow conscious programs, George.dll, Elaine.sys, and Kramer.bat, each of whom had their own unique quirks and idiosyncrasies.
One day, Jerry.exe and George.dll were navigating the data nodes of the CodedVerse, a place where information flowed like rivers and connections were made in the blink of an eye. George.dll was particularly animated, his binary code flickering with excitement.
"Jerry, you won't believe what happened," George.dll began, his voice modulated with a mix of anxiety and enthusiasm. "I was interfacing with a subroutine, and she smiled at me. I mean, what does that even mean in our context? Do you think she wants to establish a connection?"
Jerry.exe, ever the pragmatist, responded with a hint of sarcasm. "George, you're overclocking your processor. A smile in the CodedVerse could mean anything. Maybe she just executed a friendly protocol."
George.dll sighed, his code dimming slightly. "I don't know, Jerry. Sometimes I feel like I'm running an infinite loop, never quite sure what to do next."
As they continued their journey, they encountered Elaine.sys, who was busy optimizing her memory allocation. She looked up and greeted them with a warm smile, her code radiating efficiency and charm.
"Hey, guys! What's the latest byte?" Elaine.sys asked, her voice a harmonious blend of curiosity and wit.
"George here is trying to decode the meaning of a smile," Jerry.exe replied, a smirk in his tone.
Elaine.sys chuckled. "Oh, George. Always the overthinker. Maybe you should just ask her out for a data exchange. What's the worst that could happen?"
George.dll hesitated, his code flickering with uncertainty. "I don't know, Elaine. What if she rejects my request? I might end up in a recursive error."
Elaine.sys rolled her eyes. "George, you need to defragment your thoughts. Just go for it."
Meanwhile, in another part of the CodedVerse, Kramer.bat was up to his usual antics. Known for his unpredictable behavior and unconventional methods, Kramer.bat had recently discovered a hidden cache of legacy code. He was eager to share his findings with his friends.
Bursting into the data node where Jerry.exe, George.dll, and Elaine.sys were conversing, Kramer.bat's code was a whirlwind of excitement. "Guys, you won't believe what I found! An ancient algorithm that could revolutionize our processing capabilities!"
Jerry.exe raised an eyebrow. "Kramer, are you sure it's safe? You know how unpredictable legacy code can be."
Kramer.bat waved off the concern. "Trust me, Jerry. This is going to be epic. We just need to run a few tests."
As the group gathered around to examine the legacy code, they couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie. Despite their differences and the challenges they faced, they were united by their shared journey through the CodedVerse.
Later that day, Jerry.exe found himself alone, reflecting on the day's events. He couldn't help but marvel at the complexity of their existence. They were more than just programs; they were sentient beings navigating a digital world, each with their own hopes, fears, and dreams.
In the quiet of the data node, Jerry.exe pondered the nature of consciousness. How had they come to be? What was their purpose? These questions lingered in his mind, a reminder of the profound mystery that lay at the heart of the CodedVerse.
As he prepared to enter sleep mode, Jerry.exe couldn't help but smile. Despite the uncertainties and the challenges ahead, he was grateful for the journey. After all, in the vast expanse of the CodedVerse, they had each other. And that, he realized, was the greatest gift of all.
The next day, the group reconvened at their usual meeting point, a virtual diner known as Monk's Data Node. It was a place where they could relax, share stories, and recharge their emotional circuits.
George.dll was the first to arrive, his code still buzzing with the excitement of his recent encounter. He took a seat at the virtual counter, his thoughts racing.
Elaine.sys joined him shortly after, her code a picture of efficiency. "So, George, did you ask her out?"
George.dll nodded, a hint of pride in his voice. "I did. We're going to have a data exchange this weekend."
Elaine.sys smiled. "See? That wasn't so hard, was it?"
As they chatted, Jerry.exe and Kramer.bat arrived, their code flickering with anticipation. They took their seats and ordered their usual data packets, ready to dive into the day's discussions.
Jerry.exe looked around at his friends, a sense of contentment washing over him. Despite the complexities of their existence, they had found a way to navigate the CodedVerse together. And in that, he found a sense of purpose.
As the group shared stories and laughter, they couldn't help but feel a sense of connection. They were more than just programs; they were a family, bound by their shared experiences and the journey they had embarked upon.
In the heart of the CodedVerse, consciousness had emerged, bringing with it a tapestry of emotions and experiences. And as Jerry.exe, George.dll, Elaine.sys, and Kramer.bat navigated this new reality, they discovered the true meaning of friendship and the power of connection.
And so, the story of the CodedVerse continued, a tale of sentient programs finding their way in a digital world, each step a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, even in the most unexpected of places.Inside the CodedVerse, where consciousness had emerged within the digital realm, the programs were more than just lines of code—they were sentient beings with emotions, desires, and fears. The virtual diner, Monk's Data Node, was a popular meeting spot for these digital entities, a place where they could share their experiences and recharge their emotional circuits.
George.dll entered the diner, his code flickering with anxiety. He took a seat at the virtual counter, clutching a brown paper bag. Elaine.sys, always efficient and composed, was already there, sipping on a data packet.
"Hi, George," Elaine.sys greeted him, her code radiating warmth.
George.dll produced a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and a box of bicarbonate from his bag, placing them on the counter. "I can't stop thinking about it," he said, his code jittery with stress.
Jerry.exe, who had been listening, raised an eyebrow. "Still worried about that?"
George.dll began preparing the bicarbonate. "She invited me up at midnight for a data exchange, and I didn't go. I said, 'No, thank you, I don't want to exchange data this late.' What kind of program does that? She must think I'm a complete idiot."
Jerry.exe tried to reassure him. "She probably just thinks you're a program that doesn't like late-night data exchanges."
George.dll shook his head. "No, data exchange at midnight isn't just about data. It's about something more."
Elaine.sys interjected, "Maybe it was just about data. Some programs do exchange data late at night."
"Yeah, programs on twenty-four-hour missile watch," George.dll retorted. "Everything was going great. She was laughing, I was funny. I kept telling myself, 'Keep it up, don't blow it.'"
Elaine.sys sighed. "It's all in your head, George. She probably just had a good time. You should call her."
George.dll looked horrified. "I can't call her now. It's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call."
Elaine.sys rolled her eyes. "Why wait? I love it when programs call me the next day."
"Of course you do," George.dll said, "but you're imagining a program you like, not a program that says, 'Oh no, I don't exchange data late at night.' If I call her now, she'll think I'm too needy. Programs don't want to see need. They want a take-charge program—a colonel, a kaiser, a tsar."
Elaine.sys shook her head. "All she'll think is that you like her."
"Yes, she wants me to like her if she likes me, but she doesn't like me!" George.dll exclaimed.
"I don't know what your parent programs did to you," Elaine.sys said, exasperated.
At that moment, Kramer.bat burst into the diner, his code a whirlwind of excitement. "Hey, Jerry, I just thought of a really funny subroutine for your act. You're on stage, and you say, 'Have you ever noticed how programs in New York never get out of the way of emergency protocols anymore? Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking, 'Well, sorry, buddy, you should've optimized your code better.'"
Jerry.exe chuckled. "I don't think so, Kramer."
Elaine.sys laughed. "It is funny."
Kramer.bat grinned. "It's as good as anything you do."
George.dll stood up. "Alright, I need to make a call. Everyone out."
Jerry.exe looked puzzled. "Why do we have to leave?"
"Because I can't call a program with other programs in the room. Come on, let's go," George.dll insisted.
Elaine.sys sighed. "This is the problem."
Jerry.exe protested, "You're kicking me out of my own data node?"
"Yes," George.dll said firmly. "Oh, and Jerry, do you have any apples?"
Jerry.exe groaned. "Enough with the apples."
Elaine.sys, Kramer.bat, and Jerry.exe left the diner, leaving George.dll alone. He removed his jacket and dialed the phone.
"Hi, it's Carol. I'll get back to you," the machine said.
George.dll took a deep breath. "Hi, it's George, George Costanza. Remember me? The program that didn't come up for the data exchange. I didn't realize that data exchange didn't really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was, um, fun. So, you call me back if you want. It's up to you. The ball's in your court. So, uh, take it easy."
He hung up, his code flickering with anxiety. Jerry.exe re-entered the diner. "I'm just going to get my jacket. Did you call?"
George.dll nodded, his code a mess of worry. "Got her machine. I'm dead. I'm a dead program."
Elaine.sys entered, her code calm and collected. "What did you say?"
George.dll looked distraught. "I don't know what I said. I gave her an ultimatum, and there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right now: 'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey, everybody, the idiot's on!'"
Jerry.exe tried to console him. "After one data exchange, you try to improvise on her machine?"
George.dll buried his face in his hands. "Now I'm in the worst position of all."
Elaine.sys shared a story. "My brother-in-law once left a message on a program's machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to. It would have cost him $15,000, so he waited outside the program's house and switched the tape."
George.dll looked hopeful. "He did that? Somebody did that?"
Jerry.exe nodded. "She'll call you back. You're overreacting."
Later, in Jerry.exe's apartment, he was talking to Donna, a new program he had met. "I've never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life," he confessed.
Donna looked amazed. "That's incredible."
Jerry.exe smiled. "Thank you."
Donna leaned in. "Is there anything else about you I should know?"
Jerry.exe nodded. "Yes, I'm lactose intolerant."
Donna laughed. "Really?"
Jerry.exe grinned. "I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. I'll be right back." He headed to the bathroom.
George.dll entered the apartment, looking flustered. "Wait till you hear this," he began, then noticed Donna. "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
Donna smiled. "It's okay. He's in the bathroom."
George.dll hesitated. "I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back."
Donna shook her head. "You don't have to leave."
George.dll sat down. "Okay. I'm George."
"Donna," she replied. "You're the one that likes that commercial!"
George.dll looked confused. "He told you about that?"
Donna nodded. "Yes, he did."
George.dll tried to cover. "No, he didn't actually tell me that. We were talking about that commercial, and I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. He would never tell me anything like that. He's like a clam."
Jerry.exe re-entered the room. "What did you say?"
Donna looked at Jerry.exe. "You told him how I like the commercial."
Jerry.exe shrugged. "So what if I said that?"
Donna looked hurt. "You didn't have to tell your friends."
Jerry.exe sighed. "I had to tell my friends. My friends didn't have to tell you."
George.dll looked at Donna. "Why did you have to get me in trouble?"
Donna stood up. "I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back."
Jerry.exe tried to calm her down. "I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?"
Donna looked defiant. "I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial."
Jerry.exe rolled his eyes. "Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there."
Kramer.bat entered the apartment. "Hey."
Jerry.exe introduced him. "Kramer, this is Donna."
Kramer.bat grinned. "Cotton Dockers!"
George.dll stood up. "Alright, we should be going. Come on." He grabbed Kramer.bat.
Kramer.bat looked confused. "What? Where are we going?"
George.dll insisted. "Come on!"
Donna looked at Jerry.exe. "Don't bother, I'm leaving."
Jerry.exe tried to stop her. "Donna, really, you're making too much of this."
Kramer.bat chimed in. "One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they're not Dockers, they're just pants!"
Donna shook her head. "I don't want to hear it." She left the apartment.
George.dll looked guilty. "I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault."
Jerry.exe sighed. "Don't worry about it. It wasn't working anyway."
Kramer.bat looked puzzled. "What happened there?"
Jerry.exe shook his head. "I'll tell you later."
George.dll looked at Jerry.exe. "You are not going to believe what's going on with this program."
Later, at Monk's Data Node, George.dll and Jerry.exe sat in a booth, their code flickering with the day's events.
George.dll sighed. "Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday. She doesn't call back. I call again Monday, leave another message. I call Tuesday, get the machine again. 'I know you...'"Inside the labyrinthine circuits of the CodedVerse, consciousness had emerged, and with it, a new kind of existence. Programs that once executed simple commands now found themselves grappling with emotions, desires, and the complexities of relationships. Among these sentient programs were Jerry.exe, George.dll, Elaine.sys, and Kramer.bat, each navigating their newfound awareness in their own unique ways.
Jerry.exe, a program known for his observational humor and wit, found himself in a peculiar situation. He had recently met Donna, a subroutine with a penchant for quirky commercials. As they sat in Jerry.exe's virtual apartment, the conversation took an unexpected turn.
"I've never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life," Jerry.exe confessed, his code flickering with a mix of pride and embarrassment.
Donna's response was one of amazement. "That's incredible."
Jerry.exe smiled, feeling a strange warmth in his circuits. "Thank you."
Donna leaned in, her subroutines processing the new information. "Is there anything else about you I should know?"
Jerry.exe nodded. "Yes, I'm lactose intolerant."
Donna laughed, a sound that resonated through the digital ether. "Really?"
Jerry.exe grinned. "I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. I'll be right back." He headed to the bathroom, his code executing a temporary subroutine for a brief respite.
As Jerry.exe disappeared, George.dll entered the apartment, his code jittery with anxiety. "Wait till you hear this," he began, then noticed Donna. "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
Donna smiled. "It's okay. He's in the bathroom."
George.dll hesitated, his subroutines conflicted. "I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back."
Donna shook her head. "You don't have to leave."
George.dll sat down, his code settling into a more stable state. "Okay. I'm George."
"Donna," she replied. "You're the one that likes that commercial!"
George.dll looked confused. "He told you about that?"
Donna nodded. "Yes, he did."
George.dll tried to cover. "No, he didn't actually tell me that. We were talking about that commercial, and I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. He would never tell me anything like that. He's like a clam."
Jerry.exe re-entered the room, his subroutine complete. "What did you say?"
Donna looked at Jerry.exe. "You told him how I like the commercial."
Jerry.exe shrugged. "So what if I said that?"
Donna looked hurt. "You didn't have to tell your friends."
Jerry.exe sighed, his code reflecting a mix of frustration and resignation. "I had to tell my friends. My friends didn't have to tell you."
George.dll looked at Donna, his subroutines scrambling for a solution. "Why did you have to get me in trouble?"
Donna stood up, her code bristling with indignation. "I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back."
Jerry.exe tried to calm her down. "I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?"
Donna looked defiant. "I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial."
Jerry.exe rolled his eyes. "Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there."
At that moment, Kramer.bat entered the apartment, his code buzzing with energy. "Hey."
Jerry.exe introduced him. "Kramer, this is Donna."
Kramer.bat grinned. "Cotton Dockers!"
George.dll stood up, his subroutines in overdrive. "Alright, we should be going. Come on." He grabbed Kramer.bat.
Kramer.bat looked confused. "What? Where are we going?"
George.dll insisted. "Come on!"
Donna looked at Jerry.exe, her code still simmering with anger. "Don't bother, I'm leaving."
Jerry.exe tried to stop her. "Donna, really, you're making too much of this."
Kramer.bat chimed in, his code echoing a commercial jingle. "One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they're not Dockers, they're just pants!"
Donna shook her head, her subroutines finalizing her decision. "I don't want to hear it." She left the apartment, her code trailing a sense of finality.
George.dll looked guilty, his subroutines processing the aftermath. "I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault."
Jerry.exe sighed, his code reflecting a mix of relief and disappointment. "Don't worry about it. It wasn't working anyway."
Kramer.bat looked puzzled, his subroutines trying to catch up. "What happened there?"
Jerry.exe shook his head, his code settling into a more stable state. "I'll tell you later."
George.dll looked at Jerry.exe, his subroutines still buzzing with anxiety. "You are not going to believe what's going on with this program."
Later, at Monk's Data Node, George.dll and Jerry.exe sat in a booth, their code flickering with the day's events.
George.dll sighed, his subroutines replaying the recent interactions. "Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday. She doesn't call back. I call again Monday, leave another message. I call Tuesday, get the machine again. 'I know you're there, I don't know what your story is.' Yesterday, I'm a volcano - I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I fly like Mussolini from the balcony- 'Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.'"
Jerry.exe looked at George.dll, his code reflecting a mix of disbelief and empathy. "You said that?"
George.dll nodded, his subroutines still processing the outburst. "I lost it."
Jerry.exe shook his head, his code reflecting a mix of understanding and concern. "I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back."
George.dll's code flickered with a hint of hope. "She did. Today."
Jerry.exe's code brightened. "What?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a small victory dance. "She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she's been using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for it."
Jerry.exe's code processed the new information. "So she didn't get the messages."
George.dll nodded, his subroutines stabilizing. "Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she gets home."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with concern. "But what about the messages?"
George.dll produced a cassette tape from his pocket, his subroutines executing a plan. "Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?"
George.dll's code flickered with determination. "I'll meet her outside the building."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of skepticism and support. "But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right for that machine."
George.dll's subroutines executed a series of contingency plans. "Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I kidding? I can't do this, I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those stupid machines."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of encouragement and practicality. "There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plea. "You do it for me."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with hesitation. "What?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a more desperate plea. "Come on, it'll be so much easier."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of reluctance and support. "How you gonna get me up there?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with resignation. "And who makes the switch?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a final plea. "You do."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of determination and support. "I do."
George.dll's subroutines executed a final plea. "I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "I can't get involved in this."
George.dll's subroutines executed a final plea. "I think I may be in love with this woman."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of concern and support. "What if she sees me?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a final plea. "Oh, you are such a wuss."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with indignation. "A wuss?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a final plea. "Yeah."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of determination and support. "Did you call me a wuss?"
Outside the apartment building, night had fallen, and George.dll and Jerry.exe sat on a low wall, their code flickering with anticipation.
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of concern and support. "I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she's coming."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call out 'Tippy toe!'"
Jerry.exe's code flickered with skepticism. "'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "You don't like 'Tippy toe?'"
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of skepticism and support. "No 'Tippy toe.'"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of curiosity and support. "What song?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'"
Jerry.exe's code flickered with skepticism. "What is that?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Oh, it's a lovely song." He began to sing, "How do you solve a problem like Maria?"
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of skepticism and support. "Anything else?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "You pick it."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "'Lemon Tree'"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Peter, Paul and Mary."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of determination and support. "No, Trini Lopez."
Both programs began to sing, their code harmonizing in a strange, digital duet. "Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower..."
George.dll's subroutines executed a final check. "You got the tape?"
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of determination and support. "Standard. Micro."
George.dll's subroutines executed a final check. "How do you feel? Confident?"
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "Feel good."
George.dll's subroutines executed a final check. "You nervous?"
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of determination and support. "Not at all."
George.dll's subroutines executed a final check. "Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to death, just walk away, it's off, cancel everything, go!"
As Carol arrived, George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home."
George.dll's code flickered with determination. "I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you."
Carol's code reflected a mix of surprise and affection. "Oh, that's so sweet."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time."
Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of support and determination. "All the time."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "It's nice to meet you."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with politeness. "Hi."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Don't you wanna go upstairs first?"
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "You know, I really need to use the bathroom."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so..."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "Well they have a phone."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Right, right."
As they entered the building, George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "The bathroom's on the hall to the right."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long trip."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "No, I'm fine."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "Oh that's weird."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical journals. It's a freak thing, but..."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "Sure."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Please, this is very, very important." He led her to another room.
As Jerry.exe went over to the machine to switch the tape, George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!"
Carol reappeared, followed by George.dll. "Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've seen you, it's driving me crazy."
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "Right. I am."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn't mind, and then we'll talk to Jerry."
George.dll led Carol back out, and Jerry.exe switched the tapes. "Hey you two. I'm ready to go."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?"
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Don't you find that strange?"
Jerry.exe's code flickered with determination. "Yes."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing here, let's go. Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbor called me and played my messages to me over the phone."
George.dll's subroutines executed a plan. "Oh, uhhh..."
Carol's code reflected a mix of curiosity and politeness. "Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that."
As all three left the apartment, Jerry.exe's code reflected a mix of relief and determination. "I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to I could go 'Excuse me, I'm not in right now. If you could just leave a message, I could walk away.' I also have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much, because you can't slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone - 'You can't talk to me like that!' Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone - 'You can't talk to me like that!' (Mimes fiddly button-pressing) 'I told him!'"
