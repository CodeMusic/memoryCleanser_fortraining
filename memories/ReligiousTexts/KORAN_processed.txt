Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but they do not know. 002.014 When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe;" but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you: We (were) only jesting." 002.015 God will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro). 002.016 These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction, 002.017 Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, God took away their light and left them in utter darkness.

And if God willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for God hath power over all things. 002.021 O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who came before you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness; 002.022 Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto God when ye know (the truth). 002.023 And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides God, if your (doubts) are true. 002.024 But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith. 002.025 Y: But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: "Why, this is what we were fed with before," for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein (for ever). 002.026 Y: God disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: "What means God by this similitude?" By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),- 002.027 Y: Those who break God's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder what God has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These cause loss (only) to themselves. 002.028 Y: How can ye reject the faith in God?- seeing that ye were without life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return. 002.029 Y: It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover His design comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and perfection to the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge. 002.030 Y: Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent on earth." They said: "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?" He said: "I know what ye know not." 002.031 Y: And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: "Tell me the names of these if ye are right." 002.032Y: They said: "Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what ThouHast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge andwisdom." 002.033Y: He said: "O Adam! Tell them their names." When he had told them,God said: "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven andearth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?" 002.034 Y: And behold, We said to the angels: "Bow down to Adam" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith. 002.035 Y: We said: "O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression." 002.036 Y: Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: "Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood- for a time." 002.037Y: Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his LordTurned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. 002.038 Y: We said: "Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from me," whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. 002.039 Y: "But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein." 002.040Y: O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which Ibestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil MyCovenant with you, and fear none but Me. 002.041 Y: And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you, and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a small price; and fear Me, and Me alone. 002.042 Y: And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know (what it is). 002.043 Y: And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship)."Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who bow (in worship). Do you enjoin right conduct on the people and forget to practice it yourselves, even though you study the Scripture? Will you not understand? Seek God's help with patient perseverance and prayer; it is indeed hard, except for those who bring a lowly spirit, who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord and return to Him. O Children of Israel! Remember the special favor I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all other nations. Guard yourselves against a day when no soul shall avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted, nor compensation be taken, nor shall anyone be helped. Remember, We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons, and let your women live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord. We divided the sea for you, saved you, and drowned Pharaoh's people within your sight. We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence, you took the calf for worship and did grievous wrong. Even then, We forgave you so you might be grateful. We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion between right and wrong so you might be guided aright. Moses said to his people: "O my people! You have indeed wronged yourselves by worshiping the calf. So turn in repentance to your Maker and slay the wrong-doers; that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker." Then He turned towards you in forgiveness, for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. You said: "O Moses! We shall never believe in you until we see God manifestly," but you were dazed with thunder and lightning even as you looked on. Then We raised you up after your death so you might be grateful. We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down Manna and quails, saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you." But they rebelled; they did no harm to Us, but they harmed their own souls. We said: "Enter this town and eat of the plenty therein as you wish; but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in words, and We shall forgive your faults and increase the portion of those who do good." But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given to them; so We sent a plague from heaven upon them for their repeated transgressions. Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: "Strike the rock with your staff." Then twelve springs gushed forth, each group knew its own place for water. Eat and drink of the sustenance provided by God, and do no evil nor mischief on the earth. You said: "O Moses! We cannot endure one kind of food always; so beseech your Lord for us to produce what the earth grows: its pot-herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions." He said: "Will you exchange the better for the worse? Go down to any town, and you shall find what you want!" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of God because they rejected His signs and killed His messengers without just cause. This was because they rebelled and transgressed. Those who believe in the Qur'an, and those who follow the Jewish scriptures, and the Christians and the Sabians—any who believe in God and the Last Day and work righteousness—shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve."and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve. And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you the towering height of Mount Sinai, saying: 'Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring to remembrance what is therein: Perchance you may fear God.' But you turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of God to you, you had surely been among the lost. And well you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: 'Be ye apes, despised and rejected.' So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a lesson to those who fear God. And remember Moses said to his people: 'God commands that you sacrifice a heifer.' They said: 'Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?' He said: 'God save me from being an ignorant fool!' They said: 'Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what heifer it is!' He said: 'He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of middling age. Now do what you are commanded!' They said: 'Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us her color.' He said: 'He says: A fawn-colored heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiration of beholders!' They said: 'Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us all heifers are alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if God wills.' He said: 'He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish.' They said: 'Now hast thou brought the truth.' Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will. Remember you slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime: But God was to bring forth what you did hide. So We said: 'Strike the body with a piece of the heifer.' Thus God brings the dead to life and shows you His Signs: Perchance you may understand. Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for fear of God. And God is not unmindful of what you do. Can you entertain the hope that they will believe in you? Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of God, and perverted it knowingly after they understood it. Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: 'We believe': But when they meet each other in private, they say: 'Shall you tell them what God has revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before your Lord?' Do you not understand their aim? Know they not that God knows what they conceal and what they reveal? And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but see therein their own desires, and they do nothing but conjecture. Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say: 'This is from God,' to traffic with it for a miserable price! Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby. And they say: 'The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.' Say: 'Have you taken a promise from God, for He never breaks His promise? Or is it that you say of God what you do not know?' Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins, they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide forever. But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden: Therein shall they abide forever."the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide. And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel: Worship none but God; treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and practice regular charity. Then did you turn back, except a few among you, and you backslide even now. And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: Worship none save God, and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship and pay the poor-due. Then, after that, you slid back, save a few of you, being averse. And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: You shall not serve any but God and do good to your parents, and to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy, and you shall speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate. Then you turned back except a few of you and now too you turn aside. And remember We took your covenant: Shed no blood amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this you solemnly ratified, and to this you can bear witness. And when We made with you a covenant saying: Shed not the blood of your people nor turn a party of your people out of your dwellings. Then you ratified Our covenant and you were witnesses thereto. And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your cities; then you gave a promise while you witnessed. After this it is you, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist their enemies against them, in guilt and rancor; and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that you believe in, and do you reject the rest? But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life? And on the Day of Judgment, they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For God is not unmindful of what you do. Yet you it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression? And if they came to you as captives you would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you. Believe you in part of the Scripture and disbelieve you in part thereof? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom. For God is not unaware of what you do. These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped. Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support. These are they who buy the life of this world for the Hereafter, so their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped. We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary clear signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what you yourselves desire not, you are puffed up with pride? Some you called impostors, and others you slay! And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs of God's sovereignty, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit. Is it ever so, that, when there comes unto you a messenger from God with that which you yourselves desire not, you grow arrogant, and some you disbelieve and some you slay? And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent messengers after him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit. What! whenever then a messenger came to you with that which your souls did not desire, you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew. They say, "Our hearts are the wrappings which preserve God's Word: we need no more." Nay, God's curse is on them for their blasphemy: Little is it they believe. And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but God has cursed them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe. And they say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, God has cursed them on account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe. And when there comes to them a Book from God, confirming what is with them, although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith, when there comes to them that which they should have recognized, they refuse to believe in it but the curse of God is on those without Faith. And when there comes unto them a scripture from God, confirming that in their possession, though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those who disbelieved, and when there comes unto them that which they know to be the truth they disbelieve therein. The curse of God is on disbelievers. And when there came to them a Book from God verifying that which they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve, but when there came to them Prophet that which they did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so God's curse is on the unbelievers. Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they deny the revelation which God has sent down, in insolent envy that God of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith. Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which God has revealed, grudging that God should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves. They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom. Evil is that for which they have sold their souls that they should deny what God has revealed, out of envy that God should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers. When it is said to them: "Believe in what God has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us": yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: "Why then have you slain the prophets of God in times gone by, if you did indeed believe?" And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which God has revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in that which comes after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they possess. Say unto them, O Muhammad: Why then slew you the prophets of God aforetime, if you are indeed believers? And when it is said to them, Believe in what God has revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed to us; and they deny what is besides that, while it is the truth verifying that which they have. Say: Why then did you kill God's Prophets before if you were indeed believers? There came to you Moses with clear signs; yet you worshipped the calf even after that, and you did behave wrongfully. And Moses came unto you with clear proofs of God's Sovereignty, yet, while he was away, you chose the calf for worship and you were wrong-doers. And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments, then you took the calf for a god in his absence and you were unjust. And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you the towering height of Mount Sinai: Saying: "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken to the Law": They said: "We hear, and we disobey": And they had to drink into their hearts of the taint of the calf because of their faithlessness. Say: "Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if you have any faith!" And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, saying: Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear Our Word, they said: We hear and we rebel. And worship of the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection of the covenant. Say unto them: Evil is that which your belief enjoins on you, if you are believers. And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe the love of the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief. Say: Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers. Say: "If the last Home, with God, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek for death, if you are sincere." Say unto them: If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of God is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind as you pretend, then long for death for you must long for death if you are truthful. Say: If the future abode with God is specially for you to the exclusion of the people, then invoke death if you are truthful. But they will never seek for death, on account of the sins which their hands have sent on before them. And God is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers. But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have sent before them. God is aware of evil-doers. And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have sent before, and God knows the unjust. You will indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life, even more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes he could be given a life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from due punishment. For God sees well all that they do. And you will find them greediest of mankind for life and greedier than the idolaters. Each one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live a thousand years would beno means remove him from the doom. God is Seer of what they do. And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life, even more than those who are polytheists; each one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, but his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further from the chastisement, and God sees what they do.

Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel—for he brings down the revelation to your heart by God's will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe. Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel and Michael—God is an enemy to those who reject Faith.

We have sent down to you Manifest Signs; and none reject them but those who are perverse. Is it not the case that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throws it aside? Most of them are faithless. And when there came to them a messenger from God, confirming what was with them, a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of God behind their backs, as if they did not know.

They followed what the evil ones gave out falsely against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers were not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men magic, and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone without saying: "We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme." They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not harm anyone except by God's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of magic would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. Vile was the price for which they sold their souls, if they but knew!

If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better would have been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew! O you who believe! Say not to the Messenger words of ambiguous import, but words of respect; and hearken to him: To those without Faith is a grievous punishment. It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book, nor of the Pagans, that anything good should come down to you from your Lord. But God will choose for His special Mercy whom He will—for God is Lord of grace abounding.

None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Do you not know that God has power over all things? Do you not know that to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides Him, you have neither patron nor helper. Would you question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old? Whoever changes from Faith to Unbelief has strayed without doubt from the even way.

Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could turn you back to infidelity after you have believed, from selfish envy, after the Truth has become manifest to them. But forgive and overlook, till God accomplishes His purpose; for God has power over all things. Be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good you send forth for your souls before you, you shall find it with God: for God sees well all that you do.

And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." Those are their vain desires. Say: "Produce your proof if you are truthful." Nay, whoever submits his whole self to God and is a doer of good, he will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

The Jews say: "The Christians have nothing to stand upon"; and the Christians say: "The Jews have nothing to stand upon." Yet they both study the same Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but God will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment.Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ. And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like to what they say; so God shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ.

And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of God, God's name should be celebrated? - whose zeal is (in fact) to ruin them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world, and in the world to come, an exceeding torment.

To God belong the east and the West: Whithersoever ye turn, there is the presence of God. For God is All-Pervading, All-Knowing.

They say: "God hath begotten a son": Glory be to Him.-Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him.

To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: When He decreeth a matter, He saith to it: "Be," and it is.

Say those without knowledge: "Why speaketh not God unto us? or why cometh not unto us a Sign?" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the Signs unto any people who hold firmly to Faith (in their hearts).

Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner: But of thee no question shall be asked of the Companions of the Blazing Fire.

Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion. Say: "The Guidance of God,-that is the (only) Guidance." Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against God.

Those to whom We have sent the Book study it as it should be studied: They are the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faith therein,- the loss is their own.

O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others (for My Message).

Then guard yourselves against a Day when one soul shall not avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from her nor shall intercession profit her nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).

And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled: He said: "I will make thee an Imam to the Nations." He pleaded: "And also (Imams) from my offspring!" He answered: "But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers."

Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We covenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).

And remember Abraham said: "My Lord, make this a City of Peace, and feed its people with fruits,-such of them as believe in God and the Last Day." He said: "(Yea), and such as reject Faith,-for a while will I grant them their pleasure, but will soon drive them to the torment of Fire,- an evil destination (indeed)!"

And remember Abraham and Isma'il raised the foundations of the House (With this prayer): "Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us: For Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."

"Our Lord! make of us Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will), and of our progeny a people Muslim, bowing to Thy (will); and show us our place for the celebration of (due) rites; and turn unto us (in Mercy); for Thou art the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful."

"Our Lord! send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall rehearse Thy Signs to them and instruct them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them: For Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise."

And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase their souls with folly? Him We chose and rendered pure in this world."And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous. And who forsakes the religion of Abraham but he who makes himself a fool? Verily We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he is among the righteous. When his Lord said to him: 'Bow (thy will to Me):' He said: 'I bow (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe.' And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; 'Oh my sons! God hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.' Were ye witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said to his sons: 'What will ye worship after me?' They said: 'We shall worship Thy god and the god of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma'il and Isaac,- the one (True) God: To Him we bow (in Islam).' That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case! They say: 'Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (To salvation).' Say thou: 'Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God.' Say: 'We believe in God, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to God (in Islam).' So if they believe as ye believe, they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn back, it is they who are in schism; but God will suffice thee as against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. (Our religion is) the Baptism of God: And who can baptize better than God? And it is He Whom we worship. Say: Will ye dispute with us about God, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours; and that We are sincere (in our faith) in Him? Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma'il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than God? Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from God? but God is not unmindful of what ye do! That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case: The fools among the people will say: 'What hath turned them from the Qibla to which they were used?' Say: To God belong both east and West: He guideth whom He will to a Way that is straight. Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels (From the Faith). Indeed it was (A change) momentous, except to those guided by God. And never would God Make your faith of no effect. For God is to all people most surely full of kindness, Most Merciful. We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens: now Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord. Nor is God unmindful of what they do. Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the Signs (together), they would not follow Thy Qibla; nor art thou going to follow their Qibla; nor indeed will they follow each other's Qibla. If thou after the knowledge hath reached thee, Wert to follow their (vain) desires,-then wert thou Indeed (clearly) in the wrong."THE KORAN

002.001 A.L.M.
002.002 This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear God;
002.003 Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;
002.004 And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time, and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter.
002.005 They are on (true) guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who will prosper.
002.006 As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.
002.007 God hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).
002.008 Of the people there are some who say: "We believe in God and the Last Day;" but they do not (really) believe.
002.009 Fain would they deceive God and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and realise (it) not!
002.010 In their hearts is a disease; and God has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves).
002.011 When it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth," they say: "Why, we only Want to make peace!"
002.012 Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realise (it) not.
002.013 When it is said to them: "Believe as the others believe:" They say: "Shall we believe as the fools believe?" Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but they do not know.
002.014 When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe;" but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you: We (were) only jesting."
002.015 God will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro).
002.016 These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction,
002.017 Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, God took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see.
002.018 Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).
002.019 Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are in terror of death. But God is ever round the rejecters of Faith!
002.020 The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps) them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand still. And if God willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for God hath power over all things.
002.021 O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who came before you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness;
002.022 Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto God when ye know (the truth).
002.023 And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides God, if your (doubts) are true.
002.024 But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith."they the followers of each other's qiblah, and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you shall most surely be among the unjust. The people of the Book know this as they know their own sons; but some of them conceal the truth which they themselves know. Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognize this revelation as they recognize their sons. But a party of them knowingly conceal the truth. The Truth is from your Lord; so be not at all in doubt. To each is a goal to which God turns him; then strive together towards all that is good. Wherever you are, God will bring you together. For God has power over all things. From wherever you start forth, turn your face in the direction of the sacred Mosque; that is indeed the truth from the Lord. And God is not unmindful of what you do. So from wherever you start forth, turn your face in the direction of the sacred Mosque; and wherever you are, turn your face thither: that there be no ground of dispute against you among the people, except those of them that are bent on wickedness; so fear them not, but fear Me; and that I may complete My favors on you, and you may be guided. A similar favor have you already received in that We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our Signs, and sanctifying you, and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in new knowledge. Then remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and reject not Faith. O you who believe! seek help with patient perseverance and prayer; for God is with those who patiently persevere. And say not of those who are slain in the way of God: 'They are dead.' Nay, they are living, though you perceive it not. Be sure We shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives or the fruits of your toil, but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere, who say, when afflicted with calamity: 'To God we belong, and to Him is our return.' They are those on whom descend blessings from God, and Mercy, and they are the ones that receive guidance. Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of God. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times, should compass them round, it is no sin in them. And if anyone obeys his own impulse to good, be sure that God is He Who recognizes and knows. Those who conceal the clear Signs We have sent down, and the Guidance, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book, on them shall be God's curse, and the curse of those entitled to curse, except those who repent and make amends and openly declare the Truth. To them I turn; for I am Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. Those who reject Faith, and die rejecting, on them is God's curse, and the curse of angels, and of all mankind. They will abide therein: Their penalty will not be lightened, nor will respite be their lot. And your God is One God: There is no god but He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of the night and the day; in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the profit of mankind; in the rain which God sends down from the skies, and the life which He gives therewith to an earth that is dead; in the beasts of all kinds that He scatters through the earth; in the change of the winds, and the clouds which they trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth, indeed are Signs for a people that are wise. Yet there are men who take for worship others besides God, as equal with God: They love them as they should love God. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for God. If only the unrighteous could see, behold, they would see the penalty: that to God belongs all power, and God will strongly enforce the penalty. And there are some among men who take for themselves objects of worship besides God, whom they love as they love God, and those who believe are stronger in love for God.""On the day when those who were followed disown those who followed them, and they behold the doom, all their aims collapse with them. Those who followed will say, 'If only we had one more chance, we would clear ourselves of them as they have cleared themselves of us.' Thus, God will show them their deeds as regrets, and they will not emerge from the Fire.

O mankind! Eat of what is lawful and wholesome on the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil, for he is an open enemy to you. He commands you to do evil and shameful deeds and to say of God that which you do not know.

When it is said to them, 'Follow what God has revealed,' they say, 'We follow what we found our fathers upon.' Even though their fathers were void of wisdom and guidance? The parable of those who reject faith is like one who shouts to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries: deaf, dumb, and blind, they are void of wisdom.

O you who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for you and be grateful to God if it is Him you worship. He has only forbidden you dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name has been invoked besides that of God. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then he is guiltless. For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Those who conceal God's revelations in the Book and purchase for them a miserable profit, they swallow into themselves nothing but Fire. God will not address them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them: grievous will be their penalty. They are the ones who buy error in place of guidance and torment in place of forgiveness. How bold they are for the Fire!

It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards the East or the West, but righteousness is to believe in God, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, and the Messengers; to spend out of love for Him on kin, orphans, the needy, the wayfarer, those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, practice regular charity, fulfill contracts, and be patient in pain and adversity. Such are the people of truth, the God-fearing.

O you who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with handsome gratitude. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. After this, whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty.

In the Law of Equality, there is life for you, O men of understanding, that you may restrain yourselves. It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leaves any goods, that he makes a bequest to parents and next of kin according to reasonable usage. This is due from the God-fearing. If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on those who make the change. For God hears and knows all things. But if anyone fears partiality or wrongdoing on the part of the testator and makes peace between the parties concerned, there is no wrong in him. For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."Clause, and maketh peace between the parties, (it shall be) no sin for him. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. But he who fears an inclination to a wrong course or an act of disobedience on the part of the testator, and effects an agreement between the parties, there is no blame on him. Surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint. (Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (with hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will, it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.

Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur'an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (between right and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period (should be made up) by days later. God intends every facility for you; He does not want to put to difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.

When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them): I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calleth on Me: Let them also, with a will, listen to My call, and believe in Me: That they may walk in the right way.

Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. God knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you; so now associate with them, and seek what God hath ordained for you, and eat and drink, until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast till the night appears; but do not associate with your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques. Those are limits (set by) God: Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth God make clear His Signs to men: that they may learn self-restraint.

And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use it as bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up wrongfully and knowingly a little of (other) people's property.

They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage. It is no virtue if ye enter your houses from the back: It is virtue if ye fear God. Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear God: That ye may prosper.

Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors. And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith. But if they cease, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression.

The prohibited month for the prohibited month, and so for all things prohibited, there is the law of equality. If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, transgress ye likewise against him. But fear God, and know that God is with those who restrain themselves. And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction; but do good; for God loveth those who do good.Chapter 2: AL-BAQARA (THE COW)

002.026 God disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest.

002.028 How can ye reject the faith in God?- seeing that ye were without life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return.
002.029 It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover His design comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and perfection to the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge.
002.030 Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent on earth." They said: "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?" He said: "I know what ye know not."
002.031 And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: "Tell me the names of these if ye are right."
002.032 They said: "Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."
002.033 He said: "O Adam! Tell them their names." When he had told them, God said: "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?"
002.034 And behold, We said to the angels: "Bow down to Adam" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.
002.035 We said: "O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression."
002.036 Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: "Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood- for a time."
002.037 Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
002.038 We said: "Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from me," whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
002.039 "But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein."
002.040 O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with you, and fear none but Me.
002.041 And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you, and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a small price; and fear Me, and Me alone.
002.042 And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know (what it is).
002.043 And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship).Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who bow (in worship). Seek help in patience and prayer; it is hard except for the humble-minded, who know they will meet their Lord and return to Him. O Children of Israel! Remember My favor and that I preferred you to all other nations. Guard yourselves against a day when no soul will avail another, nor will intercession or compensation be accepted. Remember, We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with torment, and We parted the sea for you, saving you and drowning Pharaoh's people. We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence, you took the calf for worship, doing grievous wrong. Even then, We forgave you so you might be grateful. We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion to guide you. Moses said to his people: "You have wronged yourselves by worshiping the calf; turn in repentance to your Maker." Then He turned towards you in forgiveness. You said: "O Moses! We shall never believe in you until we see God manifestly," but you were dazed with thunder and lightning. Then We raised you up after your death so you might be grateful. We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down Manna and quails, saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you." But they rebelled, harming their own souls. We said: "Enter this town, eat of the plenty therein, but enter the gate with humility, and We shall forgive your faults." But the transgressors changed the word given to them, so We sent a plague from heaven. Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: "Strike the rock with your staff," and twelve springs gushed forth. Each group knew its place for water. Eat and drink of God's sustenance and do no evil on the earth. You said: "O Moses! We cannot endure one kind of food; beseech your Lord for us to produce what the earth grows." He said: "Will you exchange the better for the worse? Go to any town, and you shall find what you want." They were covered with humiliation and misery, drawing on themselves the wrath of God for rejecting His signs and slaying His messengers. Those who believe in the Qur'an, the Jewish scriptures, the Christians, and the Sabians—any who believe in God and the Last Day and work righteousness—shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.And do not lead yourselves to perdition with your own hands, and do good to others; surely God loves the doers of good. Complete the Hajj or 'umra in the service of God. If you are prevented from completing it, send an offering for sacrifice and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination. If any of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp, he should compensate by fasting, feeding the poor, or offering a sacrifice. When you are in peaceful conditions again, if anyone wishes to continue the 'umra on to the Hajj, he must make an offering he can afford. If he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in the precincts of the Sacred Mosque. Fear God, and know that God is strict in punishment.

Perform the pilgrimage and the visit to Makka for God. If you are prevented, send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and do not shave your heads until the gifts have reached their destination. Whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting, almsgiving, or offering. If you are in safety, whoever combines the visit with the pilgrimage should give such gifts as can be had with ease. If he cannot find such gifts, then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage and seven when you have returned, making ten in all. This is for those whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque. Observe your duty to God, and know that God is severe in punishment.

For Hajj are the months well known. If anyone undertakes that duty therein, let there be no obscenity, wickedness, or wrangling in the Hajj. Whatever good you do, God knows it. Take provision for the journey, but the best provision is right conduct. Fear Me, O you that are wise.

It is no crime if you seek the bounty of your Lord during the pilgrimage. When you pour down from Mount Arafat, celebrate the praises of God at the Sacred Monument, and celebrate His praises as He has directed you, even though before this, you went astray. Hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hastens onward, and ask forgiveness of God. God is Forgiving, Merciful.

When you have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises of God as you used to celebrate the praises of your fathers, with far more heart and soul. Some people say, "Our Lord! Give us (Thy bounties) in this world!" but they will have no portion in the Hereafter. Others say, "Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire!" For them, there is a goodly portion out of what they have earned. God is swift in reckoning.

Celebrate the praises of God during the appointed days. If anyone hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if anyone stays on, there is no blame on him if his aim is to do right. Fear God, and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him.

There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may dazzle you, and he calls God to witness about what is in his heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. When he turns his back, his aim everywhere is to spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and cattle. God does not love mischief. When it is said to him, "Fear God," he is led by arrogance to more crime. Enough for him is Hell; an evil bed indeed to lie on!

There is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure of God, and God is full of kindness to His devotees. O you who believe! Enter into Islam wholeheartedly and do not follow the footsteps of the evil one; he is to you an avowed enemy. If you backslide after the clear signs have come to you, know that God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

Will they wait until God comes to them in canopies of clouds, with angels in His train, and the question is settled? All questions go back to God for decision. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have sent them. If anyone, after God's favor has come to him, substitutes something else, God is strict in punishment.And the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve. Remember We took your covenant and raised above you the height of Mount Sinai, saying: "Hold firmly to what We have given you and remember what is therein: Perchance you may fear God." But you turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of God to you, you had surely been among the lost. And you knew those who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected." So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a lesson to those who fear God. And remember Moses said to his people: "God commands that you sacrifice a heifer." They said: "Do you make a laughing-stock of us?" He said: "God save me from being an ignorant fool!" They said: "Beseech on our behalf your Lord to make plain to us what it is!" He said: "He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of middling age. Now do what you are commanded!" They said: "Beseech on our behalf your Lord to make plain to us her color." He said: "He says: A fawn-colored heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiration of beholders!" They said: "Beseech on our behalf your Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us, all heifers are alike: We wish indeed for guidance if God wills." He said: "He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish." They said: "Now you have brought the truth." Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good will. Remember you slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime: But God was to bring forth what you did hide. So We said: "Strike the body with a piece of the heifer." Thus God brings the dead to life and shows you His Signs: Perchance you may understand. Thenceforth your hearts were hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for fear of God. And God is not unmindful of what you do. Can you entertain the hope that they will believe in you? Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of God, and perverted it knowingly after they understood it. When they meet the men of Faith, they say: "We believe." But when they meet each other in private, they say: "Shall you tell them what God has revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before your Lord?" Do you not understand their aim? Know they not that God knows what they conceal and what they reveal? And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but see therein their own desires, and they do nothing but conjecture. Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say: "This is from God," to traffic with it for a miserable price! Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby. And they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days." Say: "Have you taken a promise from God, for He never breaks His promise? Or is it that you say of God what you do not know?" Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins, they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide forever. But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden: Therein shall they abide forever.The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and they scoff at those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection; for God bestows His abundance without measure on whom He will. The life of the world is made to seem fair to those who disbelieve, and they mock those who believe, but those who guard against evil shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection. God gives means of subsistence to whom He pleases without measure.

Mankind was one single nation, and God sent Messengers with glad tidings and warnings; and with them, He sent the Book in truth, to judge between people in matters wherein they differed. The People of the Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among themselves except through selfish contumacy. God, by His Grace, guided the believers to the Truth concerning that wherein they differed. For God guides whom He will to a path that is straight.

Do you think that you shall enter the Garden without such trials as came to those who passed away before you? They encountered suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: "When will come the help of God?" Verily, the help of God is near!

They ask you what they should spend in charity. Say: Whatever you spend that is good is for parents, kindred, orphans, those in want, and wayfarers. And whatever good you do, God knows it well.

Fighting is prescribed for you, and you dislike it. But it is possible that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you love a thing which is bad for you. But God knows, and you do not.

They ask you concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: "Fighting therein is a grave offense; but graver is it in the sight of God to prevent access to the path of God, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members." Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. They will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. If any of you turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein.

Those who believed, suffered exile, and fought in the path of God have the hope of the Mercy of God. God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

They ask you concerning wine and gambling. Say: "In them is great sin, and some profit for men; but the sin is greater than the profit." They ask you how much they are to spend; say: "What is beyond your needs." Thus does God make clear to you His Signs so that you may consider.

They ask you concerning orphans. Say: "The best thing to do is what is for their good; if you mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren. God knows the man who means mischief from the man who means good. If God had wished, He could have put you into difficulties. He is indeed Exalted in Power, Wise."

Do not marry unbelieving women until they believe. A slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she allures you. Nor marry your girls to unbelievers until they believe. A man slave who believes is better than an unbeliever, even though he allures you. Unbelievers beckon you to the Fire, but God beckons by His Grace to the Garden of bliss and forgiveness. He makes His Signs clear to mankind so that they may celebrate His praise.

They ask you concerning women's courses. Say: "They are a hurt and a pollution, so keep away from women in their courses and do not approach them until they are clean. When they have purified themselves, you may approach them in any manner, time, or place ordained for you by God. For God loves those who turn to Him constantly and those who keep themselves pure and clean."And they ask you about menstruation. Say: It is a discomfort; therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have cleansed themselves, go in to them as God has commanded you; surely God loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify themselves.

Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how you will; but do some good act for your souls beforehand; and fear God. And know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to those who believe.

And make not God's (name) an excuse in your oaths against doing good, or acting rightly, or making peace between persons; for God is One Who hears and knows all things.

God will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.

For those who take an oath for abstention from their wives, a waiting for four months is ordained; if then they return, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. But if their intention is firm for divorce, God hears and knows all things.

Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs, if they have faith in God and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (Men), to take back any of your gifts (from your wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by God. If you (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by God, there is no blame on either of them if she gives something for her freedom. These are the limits ordained by God; so do not transgress them. If any do transgress the limits ordained by God, such persons wrong themselves as well as others.

So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), he cannot, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and he has divorced her. In that case, there is no blame on either of them if they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by God. Such are the limits ordained by God, which He makes plain to those who understand.

When you divorce women, and they fulfill the term of their ('Iddat), either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable terms; but do not take them back to injure them, or to take undue advantage; if anyone does that, he wrongs his own soul. Do not treat God's Signs as a jest, but solemnly rehearse God's favors on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your instruction. And fear God, and know that God is well acquainted with all things.

When you divorce women, and they fulfill the term of their ('Iddat), do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on equitable terms. This instruction is for all amongst you, who believe in God and the Last Day. That is the course making for most virtue and purity amongst you, and God knows, and you know not.

The mothers shall give suck to their offspring for two whole years, if the father desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost of their food and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child. An heir shall be chargeable in the same way. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no blame on them. If you decide on a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you offered, on equitable terms. But fear God and know that God sees well what you do."the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide. 002.083 Y: And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but God; treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and practice regular charity. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now). P: And (remember) when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none save God (only), and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship and pay the poor-due. Then, after that, ye slid back, save a few of you, being averse. S: And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: You shall not serve any but God and (you shall do) good to (your) parents, and to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy, and you shall speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate. Then you turned back except a few of you and (now too) you turn aside. 002.084 Y: And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnly ratified, and to this ye can bear witness. P: And when We made with you a covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your people nor turn (a party of) your people out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified (Our covenant) and ye were witnesses (thereto). S: And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your cities; then you gave a promise while you witnessed. 002.085 Y: After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancor; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For God is not unmindful of what ye do. P: Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression? - and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom. For God is not unaware of what ye do. S: Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you out of their homes, backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits; and if they should come to you, as captives you would ransom them while their very turning out was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the other? What then is the reward of such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous chastisement, and God is not at all heedless of what you do. 002.086 Y: These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped. P: Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support. S: These are they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter, so their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped. 002.087 Y: We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay! P: And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of God's sovereignty), and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you a messenger (from God) with that which ye yourselves desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay? S: And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent messengers after him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit, What! whenever then a messenger came to you with that which your souls did not desire, you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew. 002.088Y: They say, "Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve God's Word:we need no more)." Nay, God's curse is on them for their blasphemy:Little is it they believe. P: And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but God hath cursed them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe. S: And they say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, God has cursed them on account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe. 002.089 Y: And when there comes to them a Book from God, confirming what is with them,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith,- when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognized, they refuse to believe in it but the curse of God is on those without Faith. P: And when there cometh unto them a scripture from God, confirming that in their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know (to be the truth) they disbelieve therein. The curse of God is on disbelievers. S: And when there came to them a Book from God verifying that which they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve, but when there came to them (Prophet) that which they did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so God's curse is on the unbelievers. 002.090 Y: Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they deny (the revelation) which God has sent down, in insolent envy that God of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith. P: Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which God hath revealed, grudging that God should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves. They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom. S: Evil is that for which they have sold their souls that they should deny what God has revealed, out of envy that God should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers. 002.091 Y: When it is said to them: "Believe in what God Hath sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us": yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: "Why then have ye slain the prophets of God in times gone by, if ye did indeed believe?" P: And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which God hath revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in that which cometh after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they possess. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Why then slew ye the prophets of God aforetime, if ye are (indeed) believers? S: And when it is said to them, Believe in what God has revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed to us; and they deny what is besides that, while it is the truth verifying that which they have. Say: Why then did you kill God's Prophets before if you were indeed believers? 002.092 Y: There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the calf (Even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully. P: And Moses came unto you with clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty), yet, while he was away, ye chose the calf (for worship) and ye were wrong-doers. S: And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments, then you took the calf (for a god) in his absence and you were unjust. 002.093 Y: And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)": They said: "We hear, and we disobey": And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: "Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!" P: And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers. S: And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief Say: Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers. 002.094 Y: Say: "If the last Home, with God, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere." P: Say (unto them): If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of God is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind (as ye pretend), then long for death (for ye must long for death) if ye are truthful. S: Say: If the future abode with God is specially for you to the exclusion of the people, then invoke death if you are truthful. 002.095 Y: But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which their hands have sent on before them. And God is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers. P: But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have sent before them. God is aware of evil-doers. S: And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have sent before, and God knows the unjust. 002.096 Y: Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from (due) punishment. For God sees well all that they do. P: And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and (greedier) than the idolaters. (Each) one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live (a thousand years) would be"The child is born (be made to suffer) because of his child. And on the (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and (after) consultation, it is no sin for them; and if you wish to give your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provided that you pay what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to God, and know that God is Seer of what you do.

The mothers should suckle their children for two whole years for him who desires to complete the time of suckling; and their maintenance and their clothing must be borne by the father according to usage; no soul shall have imposed upon it a duty but to the extent of its capacity; neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on account of her child, nor a father on account of his child, and a similar duty (devolves) on the (father's) heir, but if both desire weaning by mutual consent and counsel, there is no blame on them, and if you wish to engage a wet-nurse for your children, there is no blame on you so long as you pay what you promised for according to usage; and be careful of (your duty to) God and know that God sees what you do.

If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: When they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And God is well acquainted with what you do.

Such of you as die and leave behind them wives, they (the wives) shall wait, keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach the term (prescribed for them) then there is no sin for you in aught that they may do with themselves in decency. God is informed of what you do.

And (as for) those of you who die and leave wives behind, they should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days; then when they have fully attained their term, there is no blame on you for what they do for themselves in a lawful manner; and God is aware of what you do.

There is no blame on you if you make an offer of betrothal or hold it in your hearts. God knows that you cherish them in your hearts: But do not make a secret contract with them except in terms honorable, nor resolve on the tie of marriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that God knows what is in your hearts, and take heed of Him; and know that God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.

There is no sin for you in that which you proclaim or hide in your minds concerning your troth with women. God knows that you will remember them. But plight not your troth with women except by uttering a recognized form of words. And do not consummate the marriage until (the term) prescribed is run. Know that God knows what is in your minds, so beware of Him; and know that God is Forgiving, Clement.

And there is no blame on you respecting that which you speak indirectly in the asking of (such) women in marriage or keep (the proposal) concealed within your minds; God knows that you will mention them, but do not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a lawful manner, and do not confirm the marriage tie until the writing is fulfilled, and know that God knows what is in your minds, therefore beware of Him, and know that God is Forgiving, Forbearing.

There is no blame on you if you divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (a suitable gift), the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means; a gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing.

It is no sin for you if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them, nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the rich according to his means, and the straitened according to his means, a fair provision. (This is) a bounden duty for those who do good.

And if you divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget liberality between yourselves. For God sees well all that you do.

Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the Middle Prayer; and stand before God in a devout (frame of mind).

Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and stand up with devotion to God.

Attend constantly to prayers and to the middle prayer and stand up truly obedient to God.

If you fear (an enemy), pray on foot, or riding, (as may be most convenient), but when you are in security, celebrate God's praises in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).

And if you go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback. And when you are again in safety, remember God, as He has taught you that which (heretofore) you knew not.

But if you are in danger, then (say your prayers) on foot or on horseback; and when you are secure, then remember God, as He has taught you what you did not know.

Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year's maintenance and residence; but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

(In the case of) those of you who are about to die and leave behind them wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the year without turning them out, but if they go out (of their own accord) there is no sin for you in that which they do of themselves within their rights. God is Mighty, Wise.

And those of you who die and leave wives behind, (make) a bequest in favor of their wives of maintenance for a year without turning (them) out, then if they themselves go away, there is no blame on you for what they do of lawful deeds by themselves, and God is Mighty, Wise.

For divorced women maintenance (should be provided) on a reasonable (scale). This is a duty on the righteous.

For divorced women a provision in kindness: a duty for those who ward off (evil).

And for the divorced women (too) provision (must be made) according to usage; (this is) a duty on those who guard (against evil).

Thus does God make clear His Signs to you: In order that you may understand.

Thus God expounds unto you His revelations so that you may understand.

God thus makes clear to you His communications that you may understand.

Did you not turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes, though they were thousands (in number), for fear of death? God said to them: "Die": Then He restored them to life. For God is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful.

Bethink thee (O Muhammad) of those of old, who went forth from their habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and God said unto them: Die; and then He brought them back to life. Lo! God is a Lord of Kindness to mankind, but most of mankind give not thanks.

Have you not considered those who went forth from their homes, for fear of death, and they were thousands, then God said to them, Die; again He gave them life; most surely God is Gracious to people, but most people are not grateful.

Then fight in the cause of God, and know that God hears and knows all things.

Fight in the way of God, and know that God is Hearer, Knower.

And fight in the way of God, and know that God is Hearing, Knowing.

Who is he that will loan to God a beautiful loan, which God will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is God that gives (you) want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return.

Who is it that will lend unto God a goodly loan, so that He may give it increase manifold? God straitens and enlarges. Unto Him you will return.

Who is it that will offer to God a goodly gift, so He will multiply it to him manifold, and God straitens and amplifies, and you shall be returned to Him.

Have you not turned your vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Moses? They said to a prophet (that was) among them: "Appoint for us a king, that we may fight in the cause of God." He said: "Is it not possible, if you were commanded to fight, that you will not fight?" They said: "How could we refuse to fight in the cause of God, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?" But when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But God has full knowledge of those who do wrong.

Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we will fight in God's way. He said: Would you then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you? They said: Why should we not fight in God's way when we have been driven from our dwellings with our children? Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, all save a few of them. God is aware of evil-doers.

Have you not considered the chiefs of the children of Israel after Musa, when they said to a prophet of theirs: Raise up for us a king, (that) we may fight in the way of God. He said: May it not be that you would not fight if fighting is ordained for you? They said: And what reason have we that we should not fight in the way of God, and we have indeed been compelled to abandon our homes and our children. But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned back, except a few of them, and God knows the unjust.

Their Prophet said to them: "God has appointed Talut as king over you." They said: "How can he exercise authority over..."Their Prophet said to them: "God has appointed Talut as king over you." They said: "How can he exercise authority over us when we are better fitted than he to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted with wealth in abundance?" He said: "God has chosen him above you and has gifted him abundantly with knowledge and bodily prowess. God grants His authority to whom He pleases. God cares for all and knows all things."

Their Prophet said: "A sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the Covenant, with an assurance of security from your Lord and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a symbol for you if you indeed have faith."

When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: "God will test you at the stream: if any drinks of its water, he goes not with my army. Only those who taste not of it go with me; a mere sip out of the hand is excused." But they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river, he and the faithful ones with him said: "This day we cannot cope with Goliath and his forces." But those who were convinced that they must meet God said: "How often, by God's will, has a small force vanquished a big one? God is with those who steadfastly persevere."

When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they prayed: "Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm. Help us against those that reject faith." By God's will, they routed them, and David slew Goliath. God gave him power and wisdom and taught him whatever He willed. If God did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But God is full of bounty to all the worlds.

These are the signs of God: we rehearse them to you in truth. Verily, you are one of the messengers. Those messengers We endowed with gifts, some above others. To one of them, God spoke; others He raised to degrees of honor. To Jesus, the son of Mary, We gave clear signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit. If God had so willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among each other after clear signs had come to them, but they chose to wrangle, some believing and others rejecting. If God had so willed, they would not have fought each other, but God fulfills His plan.

O you who believe! Spend out of the bounties We have provided for you before the Day comes when no bargaining will avail, nor friendship nor intercession. Those who reject faith are the wrong-doers.

God! There is no god but He, the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who can intercede in His presence except as He permits? He knows what appears to His creatures as before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass anything of His knowledge except as He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. He is the Most High, the Supreme in glory.

Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error. Whoever rejects evil and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold that never breaks. God hears and knows all things.

God is the Protector of those who have faith. From the depths of darkness, He will lead them forth into light. Those who reject faith, their patrons are the evil ones. From light, they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the fire, to dwell therein forever."believe. He brings them out of the darkness into the light; and those who disbelieve, their guardians are Shaitans who take them out of the light into the darkness; they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.

Hast thou not turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because God had granted him power? Abraham said: 'My Lord is He Who gives life and death.' He said: 'I give life and death.' Abraham said: 'But it is God that causes the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause it to rise from the West.' Thus was he confounded who rejected faith. Nor does God give guidance to a people unjust.

Or take the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: 'Oh! how shall God bring it to life, after its death?' but God caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up again. He said: 'How long didst thou tarry?' He said: 'Perhaps a day or part of a day.' He said: 'Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.' When this was shown clearly to him, he said: 'I know that God has power over all things.'

When Abraham said: 'Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead,' He replied: 'Have you no faith?' He said 'Yes, but just to reassure my heart.' God said, 'Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their bodies to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that God is Mighty, Wise.'

The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of God is that of a grain of corn: it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. God gives manifold increase to whom He pleases: And God cares for all and He knows all things.

Those who spend their wealth for the cause of God and afterward make not reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent; their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them, neither shall they grieve.

A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury. God is Absolute, Clement.

O you who believe! Do not make your charity worthless by reproach and injury, like him who spends his property to be seen of men and does not believe in God and the last day; so his parable is as the parable of a smooth rock with earth upon it, then a heavy rain falls upon it, so it leaves it bare; they shall not be able to gain anything of what they have earned; and God does not guide the unbelieving people.

And the parable of those who spend their property to seek the pleasure of God and for the certainty of their souls is as the parable of a garden on an elevated ground, upon which heavy rain falls so it brings forth its fruit twofold but if heavy rain does not fall upon it, then light rain is sufficient; and God sees what you do.

Would any of you like to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers flowing underneath it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein; and old age has stricken him and he has feeble offspring; and a fiery whirlwind strikes it and it is consumed by fire. Thus God makes plain His revelations unto you, in order that you may give thought.

O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have earned, and of that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and seek not the bad with intent to spend thereof in charity when you would not take it for yourselves save with disdain; and know that God is Absolute, Owner of Praise.

The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly. God promises you His forgiveness and bounties. And God cares for all and He knows all things."no means remove him from the doom. God is Seer of what they do. S: And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life (greedier) than even those who are polytheists; every one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the chastisement, and God sees what they do. 002.097 Y: Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the (revelation) to thy heart by God's will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe,- P: Say (O Muhammad, to mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is who hath revealed (this Scripture) to thy heart by God's leave, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers; S: Say: Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel for surely he revealed it to your heart by God's command, verifying that which is before it and guidance and good news for the believers. 002.098Y: Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel and Michael,- Lo! God is an enemy to those who reject Faith. P: Who is an enemy to God, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael! Then, lo! God (Himself) is an enemy to the disbelievers. S: Whoever is the enemy of God and His angels and His messengers and Jibreel and Meekaeel, so surely God is the enemy of the unbelievers. 002.099 Y: We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs (ayat); and none reject them but those who are perverse. P: Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants will disbelieve in them. S: And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors. 002.100 Y: Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside?- Nay, most of them are faithless. P: Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside? The truth is, most of them believe not. S: What! whenever they make a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? Nay, most of them do not believe. 002.101 Y: And when there came to them a messenger from God, confirming what was with them, a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of God behind their backs, as if (it had been something) they did not know! P: And when there cometh unto them a messenger from God, confirming that which they possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the Scripture of God behind their backs as if they knew not, S: And when there came to them a Messenger from God verifying that which they have, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of God behind their backs as if they knew nothing. 002.102 Y: They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: "We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme." They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by God's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but knew! P: And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they (the two angels) teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not (in the guidance of God). And from these two (angles) people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but they injure thereby no-one save by God's leave. And they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew. S: And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, "Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a disbeliever." Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot hurt with it any one except with God's permission, and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls, had they but known this. 002.103 Y: If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew! P: And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from God would be better, if they only knew. S: And if they had believed and guarded themselves (against evil), reward from God would certainly have been better; had they but known (this). 002.104 Y: O ye of Faith! Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import, but words of respect; and hearken (to him): To those without Faith is a grievous punishment. P: O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): "Listen to us" but say "Look upon us," and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful doom. S: O you who believe! do not say Raina and say Unzurna and listen, and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement. 002.105 Y: It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book, nor of the Pagans, that anything good should come down to you from your Lord. But God will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for God is Lord of grace abounding. P: Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your Lord. But God chooseth for His mercy whom He will, and God is of Infinite Bounty. S: Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do not like, nor do the polytheists, that the good should be sent down to you from your Lord, and God chooses especially whom He pleases for His mercy, and God is the Lord of mighty grace. 002.106Y: None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that God Hath power over all things? P: Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that God is Able to do all things? S: Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that God has power over all things? 002.107 Y: Knowest thou not that to God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper. P: Knowest thou not that it is God unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside God, any guardian or helper? S: Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that besides God you have no guardian or helper? 002.108 Y: Would ye question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old? but whoever changeth from Faith to Unbelief, Hath strayed without doubt from the even way. P: Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime? He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain road. S: Rather you wish to put questions to your Messenger, as Musa was questioned before; and whoever adopts unbelief instead of faith, he indeed has lost the right direction of the way. 002.109 Y: Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could Turn you (people) back to infidelity after ye have believed, from selfish envy, after the Truth hath become Manifest unto them: But forgive and overlook, Till God accomplish His purpose; for God Hath power over all things. P: Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until God give command. Lo! God is Able to do all things. S: Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back into unbelievers after your faith, out of envy from themselves, (even) after the truth has become manifest to them; but pardon and forgive, so that God should bring about His command; surely God has power over all things. 002.110 Y: And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with God: for God sees Well all that ye do. P: Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send before (you) for your souls, ye will find it with God. Lo! God is Seer of what ye do. S: And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and whatever good you send before for yourselves, you shall find it with God; surely God sees what you do. 002.111Y: And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." Those are their (vain) desires. Say: "Produce your proof if ye are truthful." P: And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof (of what ye state) if ye are truthful. S: And they say: None shall enter the garden (or paradise) except he who is a Jew or a Christian. These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful. 002.112Y: Nay,- whoever submits His whole self to God and is a doer of good,- He will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. P: Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to God while doing good, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. S: Yes! whoever submits himself entirely to God and he is the doer of good (to others) he has his reward from his Lord, and there is no fear for him nor shall he grieve. 002.113 Y: The Jews say: "The Christians have naught (to stand) upon"; and the Christians say: "The Jews have naught (To stand) upon." Yet they (Profess to) study the (same) Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but God will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment. P: And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing (true), and the Christians say the Jews follow nothing (true); yet both are readers of the Scripture. Even thus speak those who know not. God will judge between them on theThe devil threatens you with poverty and enjoins you to be niggardly, but God promises you forgiveness and abundance. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom receives abundant good. None will grasp the message but men of understanding. Whatever you spend in charity or devotion, God knows it all. Wrong-doers have no helpers. If you disclose acts of charity, it is well, but if you conceal them and give to those in need, it is better for you. It will remove some of your evil deeds. God is well acquainted with what you do. It is not required of you to set them on the right path, but God sets on the right path whom He pleases. Whatever good you give benefits your own souls, and you shall only do so seeking the "Face" of God. Whatever good you give shall be rendered back to you, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly. Charity is for those in need, who, in God's cause, are restricted from travel and cannot move about in the land. The ignorant man thinks they are free from want because of their modesty. You shall know them by their mark: they do not beg importunately. Whatever good you give, God knows it well. Those who spend their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who devour usury will not stand except as one whom the devil has driven to madness. That is because they say: "Trade is like usury," but God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who desist after receiving direction from their Lord shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for God to judge. But those who repeat the offense are companions of the Fire: they will abide therein. God will deprive usury of all blessing but will give increase for deeds of charity. He loves not creatures ungrateful and wicked. Those who believe, do deeds of righteousness, establish regular prayers, and give regular charity will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. O you who believe! Fear God and give up what remains of your demand for usury if you are indeed believers. If you do not, take notice of war from God and His Messenger. But if you turn back, you shall have your capital sums: deal not unjustly, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly. If the debtor is in difficulty, grant him time till it is easy for him to repay. But if you remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if you only knew. Fear the Day when you shall be brought back to God. Then every soul will be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly. O you who believe! When you deal with each other in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time, reduce them to writing. Let a scribe write down faithfully between the parties. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, but let him fear his Lord God and not diminish aught of what he owes. If the party liable is mentally deficient, weak, or unable to dictate, let his guardian dictate faithfully. Get two witnesses out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on for evidence. Disdain not to reduce to writing your contract for a future period, whether it be small or big: it is juster in the sight of God, more suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves. If it is a transaction carried out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame if you do not reduce it to writing. But take witness whenever you make a commercial contract, and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If you do such harm, it would be wickedness in you. So fear God; for it is He who teaches you. God is well acquainted with all things. If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession may serve the purpose. If one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee discharge his trust faithfully and fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it, his heart is tainted with sin. God knows all that you do.n, two witnesses. And if two men are not available, then a man and two women, so that if one forgets, the other can remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when summoned. Do not be averse to writing down the contract, whether small or large, with its term. This is more equitable in the sight of God and ensures greater accuracy in testimony, preventing doubts. If it is actual merchandise transferred hand to hand, there is no sin if you do not write it down. Have witnesses when you sell to one another, and let no harm be done to the scribe or witness. If you do harm, it is a sin. Observe your duty to God. God is teaching you and knows all things. If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession may serve the purpose. If one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee discharge his trust faithfully and fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; whoever conceals it, his heart is tainted with sin. God knows all that you do. 

To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether you show what is in your minds or conceal it, God will call you to account. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. God has power over all things. The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the believers. Each one believes in God, His angels, His books, and His messengers. They say: "We hear and obey. We seek Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the end of all journeys." God does not place a burden greater than one can bear. It gets every good that it earns and suffers every ill that it earns. Pray: "Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error. Lay not on us a burden like that which You laid on those before us. Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector; help us against those who stand against faith."

Chapter 3: AL-E-IMRAN (THE FAMILY OF 'IMRAN, THE HOUSE OF 'IMRAN)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. M. God! There is no god but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. He sent down the Book in truth, confirming what went before it; He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong). Those who reject Faith in the Signs of God will suffer the severest penalty. God is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution. Nothing is hidden from God on earth or in the heavens. He shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. He sent down to you the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental; they are the foundation of the Book. Others are allegorical. Those with perversity in their hearts follow the allegorical parts, seeking discord and hidden meanings, but no one knows their hidden meanings except God. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord." None will grasp the message except men of understanding. 

"Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us, but grant us mercy from Your Presence; for You are the Grantor of bounties without measure.""Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ. S: And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like to what they say; so God shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ. 002.114 Y: And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of God, God's name should be celebrated? - whose zeal is (in fact) to ruin them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world, and in the world to come, an exceeding torment. P: And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the sanctuaries of God lest His name should be mentioned therein, and striveth for their ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear. Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom. S: And who is more unjust than he who prevents (men) from the masjids of God, that His name should be remembered in them, and strives to ruin them? (As for) these, it was not proper for them that they should have entered them except in fear; they shall meet with disgrace in this world, and they shall have great chastisement in the hereafter. 002.115 Y: To God belong the east and the West: Whithersoever ye turn, there is the presence of God. For God is All-Pervading, All-Knowing. P: Unto God belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there is God's Countenance. Lo! God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. S: And God's is the East and the West, therefore, whither you turn, thither is God's purpose; surely God is Amplegiving, Knowing. 002.116 Y: They say: \"God hath begotten a son\": Glory be to Him.-Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him. P: And they say: God hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified! Nay, but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are subservient unto Him. S: And they say: God has taken to himself a son. Glory be to Him; rather, whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His; all are obedient to Him. 002.117 Y: To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: When He decreeth a matter, He saith to it: \"Be,\" and it is. P: The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. S: Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, Be, so there it is. 002.118 Y: Say those without knowledge: \"Why speaketh not God unto us? or why cometh not unto us a Sign?\" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the Signs unto any people who hold firmly to Faith (in their hearts). P: And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not God speak unto us, or some sign come unto us? Even thus, as they now speak, spake those (who were) before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made clear the revelations for people who are sure. S: And those who have no knowledge say: Why does not God speak to us or a sign come to us? Even thus said those before them, the like of what they say; their hearts are all alike. Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who are sure. 002.119Y: Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and awarner: But of thee no question shall be asked of the Companions of theBlazing Fire. P: Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) with the truth, a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire. S: Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner, and you shall not be called upon to answer for the companions of the flaming fire. 002.120 Y: Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion. Say: \"The Guidance of God,-that is the (only) Guidance.\" Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against God. P: And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of God (Himself) is Guidance. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then wouldst thou have from God no protecting guardian nor helper. S: And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians until you follow their religion. Say: Surely God's guidance, that is the (true) guidance. And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have no guardian from God, nor any helper. 002.121Y: Those to whom We have sent the Book study it as it should be studied:They are the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faiththerein,- the loss is their own. P: Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who are the losers. S: Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to be read. These believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it, these it is that are the losers. 002.122Y: O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which Ibestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others (for MyMessage). P: O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to (all) creatures. S: O children of Israel, call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations. 002.123 Y: Then guard yourselves against a-Day when one soul shall not avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from her nor shall intercession profit her nor shall anyone be helped (from outside). P: And guard (yourselves) against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession be of use to it; nor will they be helped. S: And be on your guard against a day when no soul shall avail another in the least neither shall any compensation be accepted from it, nor shall intercession profit it, nor shall they be helped. 002.124 Y: And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled: He said: \"I will make thee an Imam to the Nations.\" He pleaded: \"And also (Imams) from my offspring!\" He answered: \"But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers.\" P: And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with (His) commands, and he fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for mankind. (Abraham) said: And of my offspring (will there be leaders)? He said: My covenant includeth not wrong-doers. S: And when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words, he fulfilled them. He said: Surely I will make you an Imam of men. Ibrahim said: And of my offspring? My covenant does not include the unjust, said He. 002.125 Y: Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We covenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer). P: And when We made the House (at Makka) a resort for mankind and sanctuary, (saying): Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to pray). And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael, (saying): Purify My house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow down and prostrate themselves (in worship). S: And when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place of) security, and: Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim. And We enjoined Ibrahim and Ismail saying: Purify My House for those who visit (it) and those who abide (in it) for devotion and those who bow down (and) those who prostrate themselves. 002.126Y: And remember Abraham said: \"My Lord, make this a City of Peace, andfeed its people with fruits,-such of them as believe in God and theLast Day.\" He said: \"(Yea), and such as reject Faith,-for a while willI grant them their pleasure, but will soon drive them to the torment ofFire,- an evil destination (indeed)!\" P: And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and bestow upon its people fruits, such of them as believe in God and the Last Day, He answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire - a hapless journey's end! S: And when Ibrahim said: My Lord, make it a secure town and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in God and the last day. He said: And whoever disbelieves, I will grant him enjoyment for a short while, then I will drive him to the chastisement of the fire; and it is an evil destination. 002.127Y: And remember Abraham and Isma'il raised the foundations of the House(With this prayer): \"Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us: For Thouart the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" P: And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of theHouse, (Abraham prayed): Our Lord! Accept from us (this duty). Lo!Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower. S: And when Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the House: OurLord! accept from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing: 002.128 Y: \"Our Lord! make of us Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will), and of our progeny a people Muslim, bowing to Thy (will); and show us our place for the celebration of (due) rites; and turn unto us (in Mercy); for Thou art the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.\" P: Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful. S: Our Lord! and make us both submissive to Thee and (raise) from our offspring a nation submitting to Thee, and show us our ways of devotion and turn to us (mercifully), surely Thou art the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. 002.129 Y: \"Our Lord! send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall rehearse Thy Signs to them and instruct them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them: For Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\" P: Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, Wise. S: Our Lord! and raise up in them a Messenger from among them who shall recite to them Thy communications and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and purify them; surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise. 002.130Y: And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debasetheir souls with folly? Him We chose and rendered pure in this world:
Two witnesses. And if two men are not available, then a man and two women, so that if one forgets, the other can remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when summoned. Do not be averse to writing down the contract, whether small or large, with its term. This is more equitable in the sight of God and ensures greater accuracy in testimony, preventing doubts. If it is actual merchandise transferred hand to hand, there is no sin if you do not write it down. Have witnesses when you sell to one another, and let no harm be done to the scribe or witness. If you do harm, it is a sin. Observe your duty to God. God is teaching you and knows all things. If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession may serve the purpose. If one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee discharge his trust faithfully and fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; whoever conceals it, his heart is tainted with sin. God knows all that you do.

To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether you show what is in your minds or conceal it, God will call you to account. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. God has power over all things. The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the believers. Each one believes in God, His angels, His books, and His messengers. They say: "We hear and obey. We seek Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the end of all journeys." God does not place a burden greater than one can bear. It gets every good that it earns and suffers every ill that it earns. Pray: "Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error. Lay not on us a burden like that which You laid on those before us. Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector; help us against those who stand against faith."

Chapter 3: AL-E-IMRAN (THE FAMILY OF 'IMRAN, THE HOUSE OF 'IMRAN)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. M. God! There is no god but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. He sent down the Book in truth, confirming what went before it; He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong). Those who reject Faith in the Signs of God will suffer the severest penalty. God is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution. Nothing is hidden from God on earth or in the heavens. He shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. He sent down to you the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental; they are the foundation of the Book. Others are allegorical. Those with perversity in their hearts follow the allegorical parts, seeking discord and hidden meanings, but no one knows their hidden meanings except God. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord." None will grasp the message except men of understanding.

"Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us, but grant us mercy from Your Presence; for You are the Grantor of bounties without measure."

003.009 Y: "Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day about which there is no doubt; for God never fails in His promise." P: Our Lord! Lo! it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together to a Day of which there is no doubt. Lo! God faileth not to keep the tryst. S: Our Lord! surely Thou art the Gatherer of men on a day about which there is no doubt; surely God will not fail (His) promise.

003.010 Y: Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against God: They are themselves but fuel for the Fire. P: (On that Day) neither the riches nor the progeny of those who disbelieve will aught avail them with God. They will be fuel for Fire. S: (As for) those who disbelieve, surely neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them in the least against God, and these it is who are the fuel of the fire.

003.011 Y: (Their plight will be) no better than that of the people of Pharaoh, and their predecessors: They denied our Signs, and God called them to account for their sins. For God is strict in punishment. P: Like Pharaoh's folk and those who were before them, they disbelieved Our revelations and so God seized them for their sins. And God is severe in punishment. S: Like the striving of the people of Firon and those before them; they rejected Our communications, so God destroyed them on account of their faults; and God is severe in requiting (evil).

003.012 Y: Say to those who reject Faith: "Soon will ye be vanquished and gathered together to Hell,-an evil bed indeed (to lie on)!" P: Say (O Muhammad) unto those who disbelieve: Ye shall be overcome and gathered unto Hell, an evil resting-place. S: Say to those who disbelieve: You shall be vanquished, and driven together to hell; and evil is the resting-place.

003.013 Y: "There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met (in combat): One was fighting in the cause of God, the other resisting God; these saw with their own eyes Twice their number. But God doth support with His aid whom He pleaseth. In this is a warning for such as have eyes to see." P: There was a token for you in two hosts which met: one army fighting in the way of God, and another disbelieving, whom they saw as twice their number, clearly, with their very eyes. Thus God strengtheneth with His succour whom He will. Lo! herein verily is a lesson for those who have eyes. S: Indeed there was a sign for you in the two hosts (which) met together in encounter; one party fighting in the way of God and the other unbelieving, whom they saw twice as many as themselves with the sight of the eye and God strengthens with His aid whom He pleases; most surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight.

003.014 Y: Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet: Women and sons; Heaped-up hoards of gold and silver; horses branded (for blood and excellence); and (wealth of) cattle and well-tilled land. Such are the possessions of this world's life; but in nearness to God is the best of the goals (To return to). P: Beautified for mankind is love of the joys (that come) from women and offspring; and stored-up heaps of gold and silver, and horses branded (with their mark), and cattle and land. That is comfort of the life of the world. God! With Him is a more excellent abode. S: The love of desires, of women and sons and hoarded treasures of gold and silver and well bred horses and cattle and tilth, is made to seem fair to men; this is the provision of the life of this world; and God is He with Whom is the good goal (of life).

003.015 Y: Say: Shall I give you glad tidings of things Far better than those? For the righteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord, with rivers flowing beneath; therein is their eternal home; with companions pure (and holy); and the good pleasure of God. For in God's sight are (all) His servants,- P: Say: Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who keep from evil, with their Lord, are Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide, and pure companions, and contentment from God. God is Seer of His bondmen, S: Say: Shall I tell you what is better than these? For those who guard (against evil) are gardens with their Lord, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and pure mates and God's pleasure; and God sees the servants.

003.016 Y: (Namely), those who say: "Our Lord! we have indeed believed: forgive us, then, our sins, and save us from the agony of the Fire;"- P: Those who say: Our Lord! Lo! we believe. So forgive us our sins and guard us from the punishment of Fire; S: Those who say: Our Lord! surely we believe, therefore forgive us our faults and save us from the chastisement of the fire.

003.017 Y: Those who show patience, Firmness and self-control; who are true (in word and deed); who worship devoutly; who spend (in the way of God); and who pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning. P: The steadfast, and the truthful, and the obedient, those who spend (and hoard not), those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night. S: The patient, and the truthful, and the obedient, and those who spend (benevolently) and those who ask forgiveness in the morning times.

003.018 Y: There is no god but He: That is the witness of God, His angels, and those endued with knowledge, standing firm on justice. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Power, the Wise. P: God (Himself) is Witness that there is no God save Him. And the angels and the men of learning (too are witness). Maintaining His creation in justice, there is no God save Him the Almighty, the Wise. S: God bears witness that there is no god but He, and (so do) the angels and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining His creation with justice; there is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise.

003.019 Y: The Religion before God is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of God, God is swift in calling to account. P: Lo! religion with God (is) the Surrender (to His Will and Guidance). Those who (formerly) received the Scripture differed only after knowledge came unto them, through transgression among themselves. Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of God (will find that) lo! God is swift at reckoning. S: Surely the (true) religion with God is Islam, and those to whom the Book had been given did not show opposition but after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves; and whoever disbelieves in the communications of God then surely God is quick in reckoning.

003.020 Y: So if they dispute with thee, say: "I have submitted My whole self to God and so have those who follow me." And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: "Do ye (also) submit yourselves?" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in God's sight are (all) His servants. P: And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my purpose to God and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered? If they surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty only to convey the message (unto them). God is Seer of (His) bondmen. S: But if they dispute with you, say: I have submitted myself entirely to God and (so) every one who follows me; and say to those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people: Do you submit yourselves? So if they submit then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn back, then upon you is only the delivery of the message and God sees the servants.

003.021 Y: As to those who deny the Signs of God and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty. P: Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of God, and slay the prophets wrongfully, and slay those of mankind who enjoin equity: promise them a painful doom. S: Surely (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of God and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those among men who enjoin justice, announce to them a painful chastisement.

003.022 Y: They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help. P: Those are they whose works have failed in the world and the Hereafter; and they have no helpers. S: Those are they whose works shall become null in this world as well as the hereafter, and they shall have no helpers.

003.023 Y: Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who have been given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God, to settle their dispute, but a party of them Turn back and decline (The arbitration). P: Hast thou not seen how those who have received a portion of the Scripture invoke the Scripture of God (in their disputes) that it may judge between them; then a faction of them turn away, being opposed (to it)? S: Have you not considered those (Jews) who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God that it might decide between them, then a part of them turn back and they withdraw.

003.024 Y: This because they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days": For their forgeries deceive them as to their own religion. P: That is because they say: The Fire will not touch us save for a certain number of days. That which they used to invent hath deceived them regarding their religion. S: This is because they say: The fire shall not touch us but for a few days; and what they have forged deceives them in the matter of their religion.

003.025 Y: But how (will they fare) when we gather them together against a day about which there is no doubt, and each soul will be paid out just what it has earned, without (favour or) injustice? P: How (will it be with them) when We have brought them all together to a Day of which there is no doubt, when every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned, and they will not be wronged. S: Then how will it be when We shall gather them together on a day about which there is no doubt, and every soul shall be fully paid what it has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly?

003.026 Y: Say: "O God! Lord of Power (And Rule), Thou givest power to whom Thou pleasest, and Thou strippest off power from whom Thou pleasest: Thou enduest with honour whom Thou pleasest, and Thou bringest low whom Thou pleasest: In Thy hand is all good. Verily, over all things Thou hast power." P: Say: O God! Owner of Sovereignty! Thou givest sovereignty unto whom Thou wilt, and Thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt. Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt. In Thy hand is the good. Lo! Thou art Able to do all things."And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous. P: And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself? Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he is among the righteous. S: And who forsakes the religion of Ibrahim but he who makes himself a fool, and most certainly We chose him in this world, and in the hereafter he is most surely among the righteous. 002.131 Y: Behold! his Lord said to him: 'Bow (thy will to Me):' He said: 'I bow (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe.' P: When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds. S: When his Lord said to him, Be a Muslim, he said: I submit myself to the Lord of the worlds. 002.132 Y: And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; 'Oh my sons! God hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.' P: The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and also Jacob, (saying): O my sons! Lo! God hath chosen for you the (true) religion; therefore die not save as men who have surrendered (unto Him). S: And the same did Ibrahim enjoin on his sons and (so did) Yaqoub. O my sons! surely God has chosen for you (this) faith, therefore die not unless you are Muslims. 002.133 Y: Were ye witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said to his sons: 'What will ye worship after me?' They said: 'We shall worship Thy god and the god of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma'il and Isaac,- the one (True) God: To Him we bow (in Islam).' P: Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his sons: What will ye worship after me? They said: We shall worship thy god, the god of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One God, and unto Him we have surrendered. S: Nay! were you witnesses when death visited Yaqoub, when he said to his sons: What will you serve after me? They said: We will serve your God and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq, one God only, and to Him do we submit. 002.134 Y: That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case! P: Those are a people who have passed away. Theirs is that which they earned, and yours is that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. S: This is a people that have passed away; they shall have what they earned and you shall have what you earn, and you shall not be called upon to answer for what they did. 002.135 Y: They say: 'Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (To salvation).' Say thou: 'Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God.' P: And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Nay, but (we follow) the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the idolaters. S: And they say: Be Jews or Christians, you will be on the right course. Say: Nay! (we follow) the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not one of the polytheists. 002.136 Y: Say ye: 'We believe in God, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to God (in Islam).' P: Say (O Muslims): We believe in God and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered. S: Say: We believe in God and (in) that which had been revealed to us, and (in) that which was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes, and (in) that which was given to Musa and Isa, and (in) that which was given to the prophets from their Lord, we do not make any distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit. 002.137 Y: So if they believe as ye believe, they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn back, it is they who are in schism; but God will suffice thee as against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. P: And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe, then are they rightly guided. But if they turn away, then are they in schism, and God will suffice thee (for defence) against them. He is the Hearer, the Knower. S: If then they believe as you believe in Him, they are indeed on the right course, and if they turn back, then they are only in great opposition, so God will suffice you against them, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 002.138 Y: (Our religion is) the Baptism of God: And who can baptize better than God? And it is He Whom we worship. P: (We take our) colour from God, and who is better than God at colouring. We are His worshippers. S: (Receive) the baptism of God, and who is better than God in baptising? and Him do we serve. 002.139 Y: Say: Will ye dispute with us about God, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours; and that We are sincere (in our faith) in Him? P: Say (unto the People of the Scripture): Dispute ye with us concerning God when He is our Lord and your Lord? Ours are our works and yours your works. We look to Him alone. S: Say: Do you dispute with us about God, and He is our Lord and your Lord, and we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds, and we are sincere to Him. 002.140 Y: Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma'il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than God? Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from God? but God is not unmindful of what ye do! P: Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know best, or doth God? And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from God? God is not unaware of what ye do. S: Nay! do you say that Ibrahim and Ismail and Yaqoub and the tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Are you better knowing or God? And who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from God? And God is not at all heedless of what you do. 002.141 Y: That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case: P: Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they earned and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. S: This is a people that have passed away; they shall have what they earned and you shall have what you earn, and you shall not be called upon to answer for what they did. 002.142 Y: The fools among the people will say: 'What hath turned them from the Qibla to which they were used?' Say: To God belong both east and West: He guideth whom He will to a Way that is straight. P: The foolish of the people will say: What hath turned them from the qiblah which they formerly observed? Say: Unto God belong the East and the West. He guideth whom He will unto a straight path. S: The fools among the people will say: What has turned them from their qiblah which they had? Say: The East and the West belong only to God; He guides whom He likes to the right path. 002.143 Y: Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels (From the Faith). Indeed it was (A change) momentous, except to those guided by God. And never would God Make your faith of no effect. For God is to all people most surely full of kindness, Most Merciful. P: Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a hard (test) save for those whom God guided. But it was not God's purpose that your faith should be in vain, for God is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind. S: And thus We have made you a medium (just) nation that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and (that) the Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you; and We did not make that which you would have to be the qiblah but that We might distinguish him who follows the Messenger from him who turns back upon his heels, and this was surely hard except for those whom God has guided aright; and God was not going to make your faith to be fruitless; most surely God is Affectionate, Merciful to the people. 002.144 Y: We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens: now Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord. Nor is God unmindful of what they do. P: We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven (for guidance, O Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be, turn your faces (when ye pray) toward it. Lo! Those who have received the Scripture know that (this revelation) is the Truth from their Lord. And God is not unaware of what they do. S: Indeed We see the turning of your face to heaven, so We shall surely turn you to a qiblah which you shall like; turn then your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your face towards it, and those who have been given the Book most surely know that it is the truth from their Lord; and God is not at all heedless of what they do. 002.145 Y: Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the Signs (together), they would not follow Thy Qibla; nor art thou going to follow their Qibla; nor indeed will they follow each other's Qibla. If thou after the knowledge hath reached thee, Wert to follow their (vain) desires,-then wert thou Indeed (clearly) in the wrong. P: And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all kinds of portents, they would not follow thy qiblah, nor canst thou be a follower of their qiblah; nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of others. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then surely wert thou of the evil-doers.

S: Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships that run in the sea with that which profits men, and the water that God sends down from the cloud, then gives life with it to the earth after its death and spreads in it all (kinds of) animals, and the changing of the winds and the clouds made subservient between the heaven and the earth, there are signs for a people who understand. 002.165 Y: Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides God, as equal (with God): They love them as they should love God. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for God. If only the unrighteous could see, behold, they would see the penalty: that to God belongs all power, and God will strongly enforce the penalty. P: Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves (objects of worship which they set as) rivals to God, loving them with a love like (that which is the due) of God (only) - those who believe are stauncher in their love for God - Oh, that those who do evil had but known, (on the day) when they behold the doom, that power belongeth wholly to God, and that God is severe in punishment!

P: And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him, after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly (to our Lord) and (solemnly) invoke the curse of God upon those who lie. S: But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of God on the liars.

003.062 Y: This is the true account: There is no god except God; and God - He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. P: Lo! This verily is the true narrative. There is no God save God, and lo! God, He verily is, is the Mighty, the Wise. S: Most surely this is the true explanation, and there is no god but God; and most surely God He is the Mighty, the Wise.

003.063 Y: But if they turn back, God hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. P: And if they turn away, then lo! God is Aware of (who are) the corrupters. S: But if they turn back, then surely God knows the mischief-makers.

003.064 Y: Say: "O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but God; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than God." If then they turn back, say ye: "Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to God's Will)." P: Say: O People of the Scripture! Come to an agreement between us and you: that we shall worship none but God, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him, and that none of us shall take others for lords beside God. And if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him). S: Say: O followers of the Book! come to an equitable proposition between us and you that we shall not serve any but God and (that) we shall not associate aught with Him, and (that) some of us shall not take others for lords besides God; but if they turn back, then say: Bear witness that we are Muslims.

003.065 Y: Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him?seen, when they see the chastisement, that the power is wholly God's and that God is severe in requiting (evil). 002.166 Y: Then would those who are followed clear themselves of those who follow (them): They would see the penalty, and all relations between them would be cut off. P: (On the day) when those who were followed disown those who followed (them), and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with them. S: When those who were followed shall renounce those who followed (them), and they see the chastisement and their ties are cut asunder. 002.167 Y: And those who followed would say: "If only We had one more chance, We would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us." Thus will God show them (The fruits of) their deeds as (nothing but) regrets. Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire. P: And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will God show them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire. S: And those who followed shall say: Had there been for us a return, then we would renounce them as they have renounced us. Thus will God show them their deeds to be intense regret to them, and they shall not come forth from the fire. 002.168 Y: O ye people! Eat of what is on earth, Lawful and good; and do not follow the footsteps of the evil one, for he is to you an avowed enemy. P: O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. S: O men! eat the lawful and good things out of what is in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan; surely he is your open enemy. 002.169 Y: For he commands you what is evil and shameful, and that ye should say of God that of which ye have no knowledge. P: He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul, and that ye should tell concerning God that which ye know not. S: He only enjoins you evil and indecency, and that you may speak against God what you do not know. 002.170Y: When it is said to them: "Follow what God hath revealed:" They say:"Nay! we shall follow the ways of our fathers." What! even though their fathers Were void of wisdom and guidance? P: And when it is said unto them: Follow that which God hath revealed, they say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers were wholly unintelligent and had no guidance? S: And when it is said to them, Follow what God has revealed, they say: Nay! we follow what we found our fathers upon. What! and though their fathers had no sense at all, nor did they follow the right way. 002.171Y: The parable of those who reject Faith is as if one were to shout Like a goat-herd, to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries: Deaf, dumb, and blind, they are void of wisdom. P: The likeness of those who disbelieve (in relation to the messenger) is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except a shout and cry. Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense. S: And the parable of those who disbelieve is as the parable of one who calls out to that which hears no more than a call and a cry; deaf, dumb (and) blind, so they do not understand. 002.172 Y: O ye who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for you, and be grateful to God, if it is Him ye worship. P: O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and render thanks to God if it is (indeed) He Whom ye worship. S: O you who believe! eat of the good things that We have provided you with, and give thanks to God if Him it is that you serve. 002.173 Y: He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of God. But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless. For God is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful. P: He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and that which hath been immolated to (the name of) any other than God. But he who is driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin for him. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) God has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. 002.174 Y: Those who conceal God's revelations in the Book, and purchase for them a miserable profit,- they swallow into themselves naught but Fire; God will not address them on the Day of Resurrection. Nor purify them: Grievous will be their penalty. P: Lo! those who hide aught of the Scripture which God hath revealed and purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. Theirs will be a painful doom. S: Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that God has revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into their bellies, and God will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement. 002.175 Y: They are the ones who buy Error in place of Guidance and Torment in place of Forgiveness. Ah! what boldness (They show) for the Fire! P: Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, and torment at the price of pardon. How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire! S: These are they who buy error for the right direction and chastisement for forgiveness; how bold they are to encounter fire. 002.176 Y: (Their doom is) because God sent down the Book in truth but those who seek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism Far (from the purpose). P: That is because God hath revealed the Scripture with the truth. Lo! those who find (a cause of) disagreement in the Scripture are in open schism. S: This is because God has revealed the Book with the truth; and surely those who go against the Book are in a great opposition. 002.177 Y: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in God and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God-fearing. P: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West; but righteous is he who believeth in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture and the prophets; and giveth wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set slaves free; and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due. And those who keep their treaty when they make one, and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the God-fearing. S: It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards the East and the West, but righteousness is this that one should believe in God and the last day and the angels and the Book and the prophets, and give away wealth out of love for Him to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for (the emancipation of) the captives, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate; and the performers of their promise when they make a promise, and the patient in distress and affliction and in time of conflicts these are they who are true (to themselves) and these are they who guard (against evil). 002.178 Y: O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty. P: O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his (injured) brother, prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness. This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He who transgresseth after this will have a painful doom. S: O you who believe! retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the slain, the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female, but if any remission is made to any one by his (aggrieved) brother, then prosecution (for the bloodwit) should be made according to usage, and payment should be made to him in a good manner; this is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy; so whoever exceeds the limit after this he shall have a painful chastisement. 002.179 Y: In the Law of Equality there is (saving of) Life to you, O ye men of understanding; that ye may restrain yourselves. P: And there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding, that ye may ward off (evil). S: And there is life for you in (the law of) retaliation, O men of understanding, that you may guard yourselves. 002.180 Y: It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goods that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God-fearing. P: It is prescribed for you, when death approacheth one of you, if he leave wealth, that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness. (This is) a duty for all those who ward off (evil). S: Bequest is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you, if he leaves behind wealth for parents and near relatives, according to usage, a duty (incumbent) upon those who guard (against evil). 002.181 Y: If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on those who make the change. For God hears and knows all things. P: And whoso changeth (the will) after he hath heard it - the sin thereof is only upon those who change it. Lo! God is Hearer, Knower. S: Whoever then alters it after he has heard it, the sin of it then is only upon those who alter it; surely God is Hearing, Knowing. 002.182 Y: But if anyone fears partiality or wrong-doing on the part of the testator, and makes peace between (The parties concerned), there is no wrong in him: For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinfulClause, and make peace between the parties, it shall be no sin for him. God is Forgiving, Merciful. But he who fears an inclination to a wrong course or an act of disobedience on the part of the testator, and effects an agreement between the parties, there is no blame on him. Surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may learn self-restraint. Fasting for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number should be made up from days later. For those who can do it with hardship, is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will, it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.

Ramadhan is the month in which was sent down the Qur'an, as a guide to mankind, also clear signs for guidance and judgment between right and wrong. So every one of you who is present during that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period should be made up by days later. God intends every facility for you; He does not want to put you in difficulties. He wants you to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.

When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close to them. I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calls on Me. Let them also, with a will, listen to My call, and believe in Me, that they may walk in the right way.

Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. God knows what you used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you. So now associate with them, and seek what God has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast till the night appears. But do not associate with your wives while you are in retreat in the mosques. These are limits set by God: Approach not nigh thereto. Thus does God make clear His signs to men, that they may learn self-restraint.

And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use it as bait for the judges, with intent that you may eat up wrongfully and knowingly a little of other people's property.

They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in the affairs of men, and for Pilgrimage. It is no virtue if you enter your houses from the back: It is virtue if you fear God. Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear God, that you may prosper.

Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loves not transgressors. And slay them wherever you catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. But fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they first fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith. But if they cease, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevails justice and faith in God. But if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression.

The prohibited month for the prohibited month, and so for all things prohibited, there is the law of equality. If then anyone transgresses the prohibition against you, transgress likewise against him. But fear God, and know that God is with those who restrain themselves.

And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your destruction; but do good, for God loves those who do good.Do not lead yourselves to perdition with your own hands, and do good to others; surely God loves the doers of good. Complete the Hajj or 'umra in the service of God. If you are prevented from completing it, send an offering for sacrifice, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. If any of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp, he should compensate by fasting, feeding the poor, or offering sacrifice. When you are in peaceful conditions, if anyone wishes to continue the 'umra on to the hajj, he must make an offering he can afford. If he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in the precincts of the Sacred Mosque. Fear God, and know that God is strict in punishment.

Perform the pilgrimage and the visit to Makka for God. If you are prevented, send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and do not shave your heads until the gifts have reached their destination. Whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting, almsgiving, or offering. If you are in safety, whoever continues the visit for the pilgrimage should give such gifts as can be had with ease. If he cannot find such gifts, then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage and seven when you have returned, making ten in all. This is for those whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque. Observe your duty to God, and know that God is severe in punishment.

For Hajj are the months well known. If anyone undertakes that duty therein, let there be no obscenity, wickedness, or wrangling in the Hajj. Whatever good you do, God knows it. Take provision for the journey, but the best provision is right conduct. Fear Me, O you that are wise.

It is no crime if you seek the bounty of your Lord during the pilgrimage. When you pour down from Mount Arafat, celebrate the praises of God at the Sacred Monument, and celebrate His praises as He has directed you, even though before this, you went astray. Hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hastens onward, and ask forgiveness of God. God is Forgiving, Merciful.

When you have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises of God as you used to celebrate the praises of your fathers, with far more heart and soul. Some people say, "Our Lord! Give us in this world," but they will have no portion in the Hereafter. Others say, "Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire!" For them, there is a goodly portion of what they have earned. God is swift in reckoning.

Celebrate the praises of God during the appointed days. If anyone hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if anyone stays on, there is no blame on him if his aim is to do right. Fear God, and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him.

There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may dazzle you, and he calls God to witness about what is in his heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. When he turns his back, his aim is to spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and cattle. God does not love mischief. When it is said to him, "Fear God," he is led by arrogance to more crime. Enough for him is Hell, an evil bed indeed to lie on!

There is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure of God, and God is full of kindness to His devotees. O you who believe! Enter into Islam wholeheartedly, and do not follow the footsteps of the evil one; he is to you an avowed enemy. If you backslide after the clear signs have come to you, know that God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

Will they wait until God comes to them in canopies of clouds, with angels in His train, and the question is thus settled? All questions go back to God for decision. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have sent them. If anyone, after God's favor has come to him, substitutes something else, God is strict in punishment."Have ye no understanding? P: O People of the Scripture! Why will ye argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till after him? Have ye then no sense? S: O followers of the Book! why do you dispute about Ibrahim, when the Taurat and the Injeel were not revealed till after him; do you not then understand?

003.066 Y: Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing (Even) in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is God Who knows, and ye who know not! P: Lo! ye are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge: Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge? God knoweth. Ye know not. S: Behold! you are they who disputed about that of which you had knowledge; why then do you dispute about that of which you have no knowledge? And God knows while you do not know.

003.067 Y: Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to God's (Which is Islam), and he joined not gods with God. P: Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian; but he was an upright man who had surrendered (to God), and he was not of the idolaters. S: Ibrahim was not a Jew nor a Christian but he was (an) upright (man), a Muslim, and he was not one of the polytheists.

003.068 Y: Without doubt, among men, the nearest of kin to Abraham, are those who follow him, as are also this Prophet and those who believe: And God is the Protector of those who have faith. P: Lo! those of mankind who have the best claim to Abraham are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who believe (with him); and God is the Protecting Guardian of the believers. S: Most surely the nearest of people to Ibrahim are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe and God is the guardian of the believers.

003.069 Y: It is the wish of a section of the People of the Book to lead you astray. But they shall lead astray (Not you), but themselves, and they do not perceive! P: A party of the People of the Scripture long to make you go astray; and they make none to go astray except themselves, but they perceive not. S: A party of the followers of the Book desire that they should lead you astray, and they lead not astray but themselves, and they do not perceive.

003.070 Y: Ye People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of God, of which ye are (Yourselves) witnesses? P: O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of God, when ye (yourselves) bear witness (to their truth)? S: O followers of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in the communications of God while you witness (them)?

003.071 Y: Ye People of the Book! Why do ye clothe Truth with falsehood, and conceal the Truth, while ye have knowledge? P: O People of the Scripture! Why confound ye truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth? S: O followers of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with the falsehood and hide the truth while you know?

003.072 Y: A section of the People of the Book say: "Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers, but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may (themselves) Turn back;" P: And a party of the People of the Scripture say: Believe in that which hath been revealed unto those who believe at the opening of the day, and disbelieve at the end thereof, in order that they may return; S: And a party of the followers of the Book say: Avow belief in that which has been revealed to those who believe, in the first part of the day, and disbelieve at the end of it, perhaps they go back on their religion.

003.073 Y: "And believe no one unless he follows your religion." Say: "True guidance is the Guidance of God: (Fear ye) Lest a revelation be sent to someone (else) Like unto that which was sent unto you? or that those (Receiving such revelation) should engage you in argument before your Lord?" Say: "All bounties are in the hand of God: He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: And God careth for all, and He knoweth all things." P: And believe not save in one who followeth your religion - Say (O Muhammad): Lo! the guidance is God's Guidance - that anyone is given the like of that which was given unto you or that they may argue with you in the presence of their Lord. Say (O Muhammad): Lo! the bounty is in God's hand. He bestoweth it on whom He will. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. S: And do not believe but in him who follows your religion. Say: Surely the (true) guidance is the guidance of God that one may be given (by Him) the like of what you were given; or they would contend with you by an argument before your Lord. Say: Surely grace is in the hand of God, He gives it to whom He pleases; and God is Ample-giving, Knowing.

003.074 Y: For His Mercy He specially chooseth whom He pleaseth; for God is the Lord of bounties unbounded. P: He selecteth for His mercy whom He will. God is of Infinite Bounty. S: He specially chooses for His mercy whom He pleases; and God is the Lord of mighty grace.

003.075 Y: Among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a hoard of gold, will (readily) pay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding, because, they say, "there is no call on us (to keep faith) with these ignorant (Pagans)." but they tell a lie against God, and (well) they know it. P: Among the People of the Scripture there is he who, if thou trust him with a weight of treasure, will return it to thee. And among them there is he who, if thou trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to thee unless thou keep standing over him. That is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles. They speak a lie concerning God knowingly. S: And among the followers of the Book there are some such that if you entrust one (of them) with a heap of wealth, he shall pay it back to you; and among them there are some such that if you entrust one (of them) with a dinar he shall not pay it back to you except so long as you remain firm in demanding it; this is because they say: There is not upon us in the matter of the unlearned people any way (to reproach); and they tell a lie against God while they know.

003.076 Y: Nay.- Those that keep their plighted faith and act aright,-verily God loves those who act aright. P: Nay, but (the chosen of God is) he who fulfilleth his pledge and wardeth off (evil); for lo! God loveth those who ward off (evil). S: Yea, whoever fulfills his promise and guards (against evil) then surely God loves those who guard (against evil).

003.077 Y: As for those who sell the faith they owe to God and their own plighted word for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter: Nor will God (Deign to) speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He cleans them (of sin): They shall have a grievous penalty. P: Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of God's covenant and their oaths, they have no portion in the Hereafter. God will neither speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. Theirs will be a painful doom. S: (As for) those who take a small price for the covenant of God and their own oaths surely they shall have no portion in the hereafter, and God will not speak to them, nor will He look upon them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.

003.078 Y: There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: (As they read) you would think it is a part of the Book, but it is no part of the Book; and they say, "That is from God," but it is not from God: It is they who tell a lie against God, and (well) they know it! P: And lo! there is a party of them who distort the Scripture with their tongues, that ye may think that what they say is from the Scripture, when it is not from the Scripture. And they say: It is from God, when it is not from God; and they speak a lie concerning God knowingly. S: Most surely there is a party amongst those who distort the Book with their tongue that you may consider it to be (a part) of the Book, and they say, It is from God, while it is not from God, and they tell a lie against God whilst they know.

003.079 Y: It is not (possible) that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, and the prophetic office, should say to people: "Be ye my worshippers rather than God's": on the contrary (He would say) "Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly." P: It is not (possible) for any human being unto whom God had given the Scripture and wisdom and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said unto mankind: Be slaves of me instead of God; but (what he said was): Be ye faithful servants of the Lord by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scripture and of your constant study thereof. S: It is not meet for a mortal that God should give him the Book and the wisdom and prophethood, then he should say to men: Be my servants rather than God's; but rather (he would say): Be worshippers of the Lord because of your teaching the Book and your reading (it yourselves).

003.080 Y: Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons. What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will (To God in Islam)? P: And he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets for lords. Would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered (to God)? S: And neither would he enjoin you that you should take the angels and the prophets for lords; what! would he enjoin you with unbelief after you are Muslims?

003.081 Y: Behold! God took the covenant of the prophets, saying: "I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger, confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help." God said: "Do ye agree, and take this my Covenant as binding on you?" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses." P: When God made (His) covenant with the prophets, (He said): Behold that which I have given you of the Scripture and knowledge. And afterward there will come unto you a messenger, confirming that which ye possess. Ye shall believe in him and ye shall help him. He said: Do ye agree, and will ye take up My burden (which I lay upon you) in this (matter)? They answered: We agree. He said: Then bear ye witness. I will be a witness with you. S: And when God made a covenant through the prophets: Certainly what I have given you of Book and wisdom then a messenger comes to you verifying that which is with you, you must believe in him, and you must aid him. He said: Do you affirm and accept My compact in this (matter)? They said: We do affirm. He said: Then bear witness, and I (too) am of the bearers of witness with you.

003.082 Y: If any turn back after this, they are the transgressors."The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and they scoff at those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection; for God bestows His abundance without measure on whom He will. The life of the world is made to seem fair to those who disbelieve, and they mock those who believe, but those who guard against evil shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection. God gives means of subsistence to whom He pleases without measure.

Mankind was one single nation, and God sent Messengers with glad tidings and warnings; and with them, He sent the Book in truth, to judge between people in matters wherein they differed. But the People of the Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among themselves except through selfish contumacy. God by His Grace guided the believers to the Truth concerning that wherein they differed. For God guides whom He will to a path that is straight.

Do you think that you shall enter the Garden without such trials as came to those who passed away before you? They encountered suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: "When will the help of God come?" Verily, the help of God is near!

They ask you what they should spend in charity. Say: Whatever you spend that is good is for parents, kindred, orphans, those in want, and wayfarers. And whatever good you do, God knows it well.

Fighting is prescribed for you, and you dislike it. But it is possible that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you love a thing which is bad for you. But God knows, and you know not.

They ask you concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: "Fighting therein is a grave offense; but graver is it in the sight of God to prevent access to the path of God, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members." Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. They will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein.

Those who believed, suffered exile, and fought in the path of God have the hope of the Mercy of God. And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

They ask you concerning wine and gambling. Say: "In them is great sin, and some profit for men; but the sin is greater than the profit." They ask you how much they are to spend; Say: "What is beyond your needs." Thus does God make clear to you His Signs, in order that you may consider.

They ask you concerning orphans. Say: "The best thing to do is what is for their good; if you mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren. God knows the man who means mischief from the man who means good. If God had wished, He could have put you into difficulties: He is indeed Exalted in Power, Wise."

Do not marry unbelieving women until they believe. A slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she allures you. Nor marry your girls to unbelievers until they believe. A man slave who believes is better than an unbeliever, even though he allures you. Unbelievers beckon you to the Fire, but God beckons by His Grace to the Garden and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind that they may celebrate His praise.

They ask you concerning women's courses. Say: "They are a hurt and a pollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, you may approach them in any manner, time, or place ordained for you by God. For God loves those who turn to Him constantly and those who keep themselves pure and clean.""en alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are cleansed. And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as God hath enjoined upon you. Truly God loveth those who turn unto Him, and loveth those who have a care for cleanness. 

They ask you about menstruation. Say: It is a discomfort; therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have cleansed themselves, go in to them as God has commanded you; surely God loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify themselves.

Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; but do some good act for your souls beforehand; and fear God. And know that ye are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give (these) good tidings to those who believe.

And make not God's (name) an excuse in your oaths against doing good, or acting rightly, or making peace between persons; for God is One Who heareth and knoweth all things.

God will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.

For those who take an oath for abstention from their wives, a waiting for four months is ordained; if then they return, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

But if their intention is firm for divorce, God heareth and knoweth all things.

Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what God Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in God and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (Men), to take back any of your gifts (from your wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by God. If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by God, there is no blame on either of them if she give something for her freedom. These are the limits ordained by God; so do not transgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by God, such persons wrong (Themselves as well as others).

So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), He cannot, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and He has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by God. Such are the limits ordained by God, which He makes plain to those who understand.

When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ('Iddat), either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable terms; but do not take them back to injure them, (or) to take undue advantage; if any one does that; He wrongs his own soul. Do not treat God's Signs as a jest, but solemnly rehearse God's favours on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your instruction. And fear God, and know that God is well acquainted with all things.

When ye divorce women and they reach their term, place not difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in kindness. This is an admonition for him among you who believeth in God and the Last Day. That is more virtuous for you, and cleaner. God knoweth; ye know not.

The mothers shall give suck to their offspring for two whole years, if the father desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost of their food and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child. Nor father on account of his child, an heir shall be chargeable in the same way. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no blame on them. If ye decide on a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you, provided ye pay (the mother) what ye offered, on equitable terms. But fear God and know that God sees well what ye do.""re perverted transgressors. P: Then whosoever after this shall turn away: they will be miscreants. S: Whoever therefore turns back after this, these it is that are the transgressors.

003.083 Y: Do they seek for other than the Religion of God?-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back. P: Seek they other than the religion of God, when unto Him submitteth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and unto Him they will be returned. S: Is it then other than God's religion that they seek (to follow), and to Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him shall they be returned.

003.084 Y: Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will (in Islam)." P: Say (O Muhammad): We believe in God and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered. S: Say: We believe in God and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes, and what was given to Musa and Isa and to the prophets from their Lord; we do not make any distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit.

003.085 Y: If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good). P: And whoso seeketh as religion other than the Surrender (to God) it will not be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the Hereafter. S: And whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.

003.086 Y: How shall God Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them? but God guides not a people unjust. P: How shall God guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and (after) they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty) had come unto them. And God guideth not wrongdoing folk. S: How shall God guide a people who disbelieved after their believing and (after) they had borne witness that the Messenger was true and clear arguments had come to them; and God does not guide the unjust people.

003.087 Y: Of such the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of God, of His angels, and of all mankind;- P: As for such, their guerdon is that on them rests the curse of God and of angels and of men combined. S: (As for) these, their reward is that upon them is the curse of God and the angels and of men, all together.

003.088 Y: In that will they dwell; nor will their penalty be lightened, nor respite be (their lot);- P: They will abide therein. Their doom will not be lightened, neither will they be reprieved; S: Abiding in it; their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be respited.

003.089 Y: Except for those that repent (Even) after that, and make amends; for verily God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: Save those who afterward repent and do right. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: Except those who repent after that and amend, then surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

003.090 Y: But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray. P: Lo! those who disbelieve after their (profession of) belief, and afterward grow violent in disbelief: their repentance will not be accepted. And such are those who are astray. S: Surely, those who disbelieve after their believing, then increase in unbelief, their repentance shall not be accepted, and these are they that go astray.

003.091 Y: As to those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains, though they should offer it for ransom. For such is (in store) a penalty grievous, and they will find no helpers. P: Lo! those who disbelieve, and die in disbelief, the (whole) earth full of gold would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom (for his soul). Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers. S: Surely, those who disbelieve and die while they are unbelievers, the earth full of gold shall not be accepted from one of them, though he should offer to ransom himself with it, these it is who shall have a painful chastisement, and they shall have no helpers.

003.092 Y: By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye give (freely) of that which ye love; and whatever ye give, of a truth God knoweth it well. P: Ye will not attain unto piety until ye spend of that which ye love. And whatsoever ye spend, God is Aware thereof. S: By no means shall you attain to righteousness until you spend (benevolently) out of what you love; and whatever thing you spend, God surely knows it.

003.093 Y: All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel made unlawful for itself, before the Law (of Moses) was revealed. Say: "Bring ye the Law and study it, if ye be men of truth." P: All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel, save that which Israel forbade himself, (in days) before the Torah was revealed. Say: Produce the Torah and read it (unto us) if ye are truthful. S: All food was lawful to the children of Israel except that which Israel had forbidden to himself, before the Taurat was revealed. Say: Bring then the Taurat and read it, if you are truthful.

003.094 Y: If any, after this, invent a lie and attribute it to God, they are indeed unjust wrong-doers. P: And whoever shall invent a falsehood after that concerning God, such will be wrong-doers. S: Then whoever fabricates a lie against God after this, these it is that are the unjust.

003.095 Y: Say: "God speaketh the Truth: follow the religion of Abraham, the sane in faith; he was not of the Pagans." P: Say: God speaketh truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, the upright. He was not of the idolaters. S: Say: God has spoken the truth, therefore follow the religion of Ibrahim, the upright one; and he was not one of the polytheists.

003.096 Y: The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka: Full of blessing and of guidance for all kinds of beings: P: Lo! the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Becca, a blessed place, a guidance to the peoples; S: Most surely the first house appointed for men is the one at Bekka, blessed and a guidance for the nations.

003.097 Y: In it are Signs Manifest; (for example), the Station of Abraham; whoever enters it attains security; Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to God,- those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith, God stands not in need of any of His creatures. P: Wherein are plain memorials (of God's guidance); the place where Abraham stood up to pray; and whosoever entereth it is safe. And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto God for mankind, for him who can find a way thither. As for him who disbelieveth, (let him know that) lo! God is Independent of (all) creatures. S: In it are clear signs, the standing place of Ibrahim, and whoever enters it shall be secure, and pilgrimage to the House is incumbent upon men for the sake of God, (upon) every one who is able to undertake the journey to it; and whoever disbelieves, then surely God is Self-sufficient, above any need of the worlds.

003.098 Y: Say: "O People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of God, when God is Himself witness to all ye do?" P: Say: O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of God, when God (Himself) is Witness of what ye do? S: Say: O followers of the Book! why do you disbelieve in the communications of God? And God is a witness of what you do.

003.099 Y: Say: "O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe, from the path of God, Seeking to make it crooked, while ye were yourselves witnesses (to God's Covenant)? but God is not unmindful of all that ye do." P: Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers from the way of God, seeking to make it crooked, when ye are witnesses (to God's guidance)? God is not unaware of what ye do. S: Say: O followers of the Book! why do you hinder him who believes from the way of God? You seek (to make) it crooked, while you are witness, and God is not heedless of what you do.

003.100 Y: O ye who believe! If ye listen to a faction among the People of the Book, they would (indeed) render you apostates after ye have believed! P: O ye who believe! If ye obey a party of those who have received the Scripture they will make you disbelievers after your belief. S: O you who believe! if you obey a party from among those who have been given the Book, they will turn you back as unbelievers after you have believed.

003.101 Y: And how would ye deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs of God, and among you Lives the Messenger? Whoever holds firmly to God will be shown a way that is straight. P: How can ye disbelieve, when it is ye unto whom God's revelations are recited, and His messenger is in your midst? He who holdeth fast to God, he indeed is guided unto a right path. S: But how can you disbelieve while it is you to whom the communications of God are recited, and among you is His Messenger? And whoever holds fast to God, he indeed is guided to the right path.

003.102 Y: O ye who believe! Fear God as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam. P: O ye who believe! Observe your duty to God with right observance, and die not save as those who have surrendered (unto Him) S: O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) God with the care which is due to Him, and do not die unless you are Muslims.

003.103 Y: And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude God's favour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth God make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided. P: And hold fast, all of you together, to the cable of God, and do not separate. And remember God's favour unto you: How ye were enemies and He made friendship between your hearts so that ye became as brothers by His grace; and"The child is born (be made to suffer) because of his child. And on the (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and (after) consultation, it is no sin for them; and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provided that ye pay what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to God, and know that God is Seer of what ye do.

If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: When they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And God is well acquainted with what ye do.

There is no blame on you if ye make an offer of betrothal or hold it in your hearts. God knows that ye cherish them in your hearts: But do not make a secret contract with them except in terms honorable, nor resolve on the tie of marriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that God Knoweth what is in your hearts, and take heed of Him; and know that God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.

There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (a suitable gift), the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means; a gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing.

And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget liberality between yourselves. For God sees well all that ye do.

Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the Middle Prayer; and stand before God in a devout (frame of mind).

If ye fear (an enemy), pray on foot, or riding, (as may be most convenient), but when ye are in security, celebrate God's praises in the manner He has taught you, which ye knew not (before).

Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year's maintenance and residence; but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

For divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on a reasonable (scale). This is a duty on the righteous.

Thus doth God make clear His signs to you: In order that ye may understand.

Didst thou not turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes, though they were thousands (in number), for fear of death? God said to them: "Die": Then He restored them to life. For God is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful.

Then fight in the cause of God, and know that God heareth and knoweth all things.

Who is he that will loan to God a beautiful loan, which God will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is God that giveth (you) want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return.

Hast thou not turned thy vision to the chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Moses? They said to a prophet (that was) among them: "Appoint for us a king, that we may fight in the cause of God." He said: "Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that ye will not fight?" They said: "How could we refuse to fight in the cause of God, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?" But when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But God has full knowledge of those who do wrong.

Their Prophet said to them: "God hath appointed Talut as king over you." They said: "How can he exercise authority over...Their Prophet said to them: "God has appointed Talut as king over you." They said: "How can he exercise authority over us when we are better fitted and he lacks wealth?" He replied: "God has chosen him above you and gifted him with knowledge and strength. God grants His authority to whom He pleases and knows all things."

Their Prophet continued: "A sign of his authority is that the Ark of the Covenant will come to you, bringing peace and relics from the families of Moses and Aaron, carried by angels. This is a symbol for you if you have faith."

When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: "God will test you at the stream: those who drink its water will not be part of my army, except those who take a mere sip." But they all drank, except a few. When they crossed the river, the faithful ones said: "We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces today." But those convinced of meeting God said: "How often has a small force vanquished a big one by God's will! God is with those who persevere."

When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they prayed: "Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us, make our steps firm, and help us against those who reject faith." By God's will, they routed them, and David slew Goliath. God gave him power, wisdom, and taught him whatever He willed. If God did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would be full of mischief. But God is full of bounty to all the worlds.

These are the signs of God: we rehearse them to you in truth. You are one of the messengers. Those messengers were endowed with gifts, some above others. To one, God spoke; others He raised to degrees of honor. To Jesus, the son of Mary, We gave clear signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit. If God had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among each other after clear signs had come to them. But they chose to wrangle, some believing and others rejecting. If God had willed, they would not have fought each other, but God fulfills His plan.

O you who believe! Spend out of what We have provided for you before the Day comes when no bargaining, friendship, or intercession will avail. Those who reject faith are the wrong-doers.

God! There is no god but He, the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who can intercede in His presence except as He permits? He knows what is before and after them. They cannot encompass any of His knowledge except as He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. He is the Most High, the Supreme.

Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error. Whoever rejects evil and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold that never breaks. God hears and knows all things.

God is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness, He will lead them forth into light. Those who reject faith have evil ones as patrons, leading them from light into darkness. They will be companions of the fire, to dwell therein forever."believe. He brings them out of the darkness into the light; and those who disbelieve, their guardians are Shaitans who take them out of the light into the darkness; they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.

Hast thou not turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because God had granted him power? Abraham said: 'My Lord is He Who gives life and death.' He said: 'I give life and death.' Abraham said: 'But it is God that causes the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause it to rise from the west.' Thus was he confounded who rejected faith. Nor does God give guidance to a people unjust.

Or take the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: 'Oh! how shall God bring it to life, after its death?' but God caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up again. He said: 'How long didst thou tarry?' He said: 'Perhaps a day or part of a day.' He said: 'Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.' When this was shown clearly to him, he said: 'I know that God has power over all things.'

When Abraham said: 'Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead,' He replied: 'Have you no faith?' He said 'Yes, but just to reassure my heart.' God said, 'Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their bodies to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that God is Mighty, Wise.'

The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of God is that of a grain of corn: it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. God gives manifold increase to whom He pleases: And God cares for all and He knows all things.

Those who spend their substance in the cause of God, and follow not up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury, for them their reward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity followed by injury. God is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing.

O you who believe! Cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like those who spend their substance to be seen of men, but believe neither in God nor in the Last Day. They are in parable like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain, which leaves it just a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with what they have earned. And God does not guide those who reject faith.

And the likeness of those who spend their substance, seeking to please God and to strengthen their souls, is as a garden, high and fertile: heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest, and if it receives not heavy rain, light moisture suffices it. God sees well whatever you do.

Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vines and streams flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are not strong enough to look after themselves, that it should be caught in a whirlwind, with fire therein, and be burnt up? Thus does God make clear to you His signs, that you may consider.

O you who believe! Give of the good things which you have earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it you may give away something, when you yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that God is free of all wants, and worthy of all praise.

The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly. God promises you His forgiveness and bounties. And God cares for all and He knows all things."The devil threatens you with poverty and enjoins you to be niggardly, but God promises you forgiveness and abundance. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom receives great good. None will grasp the message but men of understanding. Whatever you spend in charity or devotion, God knows it all. Wrong-doers have no helpers. If you disclose acts of charity, it is well, but if you conceal them and give to those in need, it is better for you. It will remove some of your evil deeds. God is well acquainted with what you do. It is not required of you to set them on the right path, but God sets on the right path whom He pleases. Whatever good you give benefits your own souls, seeking the "Face" of God. Whatever good you give shall be rendered back to you, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly. Charity is for those in need, who are restricted from travel and cannot move about in the land. The ignorant man thinks they are free from want because of their modesty. You shall know them by their mark: they do not beg importunately. Whatever good you give, God knows it well. Those who spend their goods by night and day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who devour usury will not stand except as one driven to madness by the touch of the Evil one. That is because they say: "Trade is like usury," but God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who desist after receiving direction from their Lord shall be pardoned for the past. Their case is for God to judge. Those who repeat the offense are companions of the Fire: they will abide therein. God will deprive usury of all blessing but will give increase for deeds of charity. He loves not creatures ungrateful and wicked. Those who believe, do deeds of righteousness, establish regular prayers, and give regular charity will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. O you who believe! Fear God and give up what remains of your demand for usury if you are indeed believers. If you do not, take notice of war from God and His Messenger. If you repent, you shall have your capital sums: deal not unjustly, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly. If the debtor is in difficulty, grant him time till it is easy for him to repay. If you remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if you only knew. Fear the Day when you shall be brought back to God. Then every soul will be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly. O you who believe! When you deal with each other in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time, reduce them to writing. Let a scribe write down faithfully between the parties. Let not the scribe refuse to write as God has taught him. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, but let him fear his Lord God and not diminish aught of what he owes. If the party liable is mentally deficient, weak, or unable to dictate, let his guardian dictate faithfully. Get two witnesses out of your own men, or if there are not two men, then a man and two women, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when called on for evidence. Disdain not to reduce to writing your contract for a future period, whether small or big. It is juster in the sight of God, more suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves. If it is a transaction carried out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame if you do not reduce it to writing. But take witness whenever you make a commercial contract, and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If you do such harm, it would be wickedness in you. So fear God, for it is He who teaches you. God is well acquainted with all things. If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession may serve the purpose. If one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee discharge his trust faithfully and fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence, for whoever conceals it, his heart is tainted with sin. God knows all that you do.(how) ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire, and He did save you from it. Thus God maketh clear His revelations unto you, that haply ye may be guided. S: And hold fast by the covenant of God all together and be not disunited, and remember the favor of God on you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts so by His favor you became brethren; and you were on the brink of a pit of fire, then He saved you from it, thus does God make clear to you His communications that you may follow the right way.

003.104 Y: Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity. P: And there may spring from you a nation who invite to goodness, and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency. Such are they who are successful. S: And from among you there should be a party who invite to good and enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong, and these it is that shall be successful.

003.105 Y: Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty. P: And be ye not as those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs had come unto them. For such there is an awful doom. S: And be not like those who became divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them, and these it is that shall have a grievous chastisement.

003.106 Y: On the Day when some faces will be (lit up with) white, and some faces will be (in the gloom of) black: To those whose faces will be black, (will be said): "Did ye reject Faith after accepting it? Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith." P: On the Day when (some) faces will be whitened and (some) faces will be blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it will be said unto them: Disbelieved ye after your (profession of) belief? Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved. S: On the day when (some) faces shall turn white and (some) faces shall turn black; then as to those whose faces turn black: Did you disbelieve after your believing? Taste therefore the chastisement because you disbelieved.

003.107 Y: But those whose faces will be (lit with) white,- they will be in (the light of) God's mercy: therein to dwell (for ever). P: And as for those whose faces have been whitened, in the mercy of God they dwell forever. S: And as to those whose faces turn white, they shall be in God's mercy; in it they shall abide.

003.108 Y: These are the Signs of God: We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And God means no injustice to any of His creatures. P: These are revelations of God. We recite them unto thee in truth. God willeth no injustice to (His) creatures. S: These are the communications of God which We recite to you with truth, and God does not desire any injustice to the creatures.

003.109 Y: To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Him do all questions go back (for decision). P: Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; and unto God all things are returned. S: And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is God's; and to God all things return.

003.110 Y: Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in God. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors. P: Ye are the best community that hath been raised up for mankind. Ye enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in God. And if the People of the Scripture had believed it had been better for them. Some of them are believers; but most of them are evil-livers. S: You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors.

003.111 Y: They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out to fight you, they will show you their backs, and no help shall they get. P: They will not harm you save a trifling hurt, and if they fight against you they will turn and flee. And afterward they will not be helped. S: They shall by no means harm you but with a slight evil; and if they fight with you they shall turn (their) backs to you, then shall they not be helped.

003.112 Y: Shame is pitched over them (Like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from God and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from God, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of God, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds. P: Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save (where they grasp) a rope from God and a rope from men. They have incurred anger from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is because they used to disbelieve the revelations of God, and slew the prophets wrongfully. That is because they were rebellious and used to transgress. S: Abasement is made to cleave to them wherever they are found, except under a covenant with God and a covenant with men, and they have become deserving of wrath from God, and humiliation is made to cleave to them; this is because they disbelieved in the communications of God and slew the prophets unjustly; this is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.

003.113 Y: Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. P: They are not all alike. Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch community who recite the revelations of God in the night season, falling prostrate (before Him). S: They are not all alike; of the followers of the Book there is an upright party; they recite God's communications in the nighttime and they adore (Him).

003.114 Y: They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous. P: They believe in God and the Last Day, and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency, and vie one with another in good works. These are of the righteous. S: They believe in God and the last day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and they strive with one another in hastening to good deeds, and those are among the good.

003.115 Y: Of the good that they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for God knoweth well those that do right. P: And whatever good they do, they will not be denied the meed thereof. God is Aware of those who ward off (evil). S: And whatever good they do, they shall not be denied it, and God knows those who guard (against evil).

003.116 Y: Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against God: They will be companions of the Fire,-dwelling therein (for ever). P: Lo! the riches and the progeny of those who disbelieve will not avail them aught against God; and such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. S: (As for) those who disbelieve, surely neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them in the least against God; and these are the inmates of the fire; therein they shall abide.

003.117 Y: What they spend in the life of this (material) world May be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not God that hath wronged them, but they wrong themselves. P: The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the likeness of a biting, icy wind which smiteth the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves, and devastateth it. God wronged them not, but they do wrong themselves. S: The likeness of what they spend in the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense cold (that) smites the seed produce of a people who have done injustice to their souls and destroys it; and God is not unjust to them, but they are unjust to themselves.

003.118 Y: O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom. P: O ye who believe! Take not for intimates others than your own folk, who would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you. Hatred is revealed by (the utterance of) their mouths, but that which their breasts hide is greater. We have made plain for you the revelations if ye will understand. S: O you who believe! do not take for intimate friends from among others than your own people; they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon you; they love what distresses you; vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still; indeed, We have made the communications clear to you, if you will understand.

003.119 Y: Ah! ye are those who love them, but they love you not,- though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe": But when they are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: "Perish in your rage; God knoweth well all the secrets of the heart." P: Lo! ye are those who love them though they love you not, and ye believe in all the Scripture. When they fall in with you they say: We believe; but when they go apart they bite their finger-tips at you, for rage. Say: Perish in your rage! Lo! God is Aware of what is hidden in (your) breasts. S: Lo! you are they who will love them while they do not love you, and you believe in the Book (in) the whole of it; and when they meet you they say: We believe, and when they are alone, they bite the ends of their fingers in rage against you. Say: Die in your rage; surely God knows what is in the breasts.

003.120 Y: If aught that is good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if ye are constant and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for God Compasseth round about all that they do. P: If a lucky chance befall you, it is evil unto them, and if disaster strike you they rejoice thereat. But if ye persevere and keep from evil their guile will never harm you. Lo! God is Surrounding what they do. S: If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if an evil afflicts you, they rejoice at it; and if you are patient and guard yourselves, their scheme will not injure you in any way; surely God comprehends what they do.n, two witnesses. And if two men are not available, then a man and two women, so that if one forgets, the other can remind her. Witnesses must not refuse when summoned. Do not be averse to writing down the contract, whether small or great, with its term. This is more equitable in the sight of God and more sure for testimony, and the best way to avoid doubt between you, except when it is actual merchandise transferred among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case, it is no sin if you do not write it down. Have witnesses when you sell to one another, and let no harm be done to the scribe or witness. If you do harm, it is a sin. Observe your duty to God. God is teaching you and knows all things.

If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession may serve the purpose. If one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee discharge his trust faithfully and fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; whoever conceals it, his heart is tainted with sin. God knows all that you do.

To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether you show what is in your minds or conceal it, God will call you to account for it. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases, for God has power over all things.

The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the men of faith. Each one believes in God, His angels, His books, and His messengers. "We make no distinction between any of His messengers." They say: "We hear and obey. We seek Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the end of all journeys."

God does not place a burden greater than one can bear. It gets every good that it earns and suffers every ill that it earns. Pray: "Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error. Lay not on us a burden like that which You laid on those before us. Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector; help us against those who stand against faith."

Chapter 3: AL-E-IMRAN (THE FAMILY OF 'IMRAN, THE HOUSE OF 'IMRAN)
Total Verses: 200
Revealed At: MADINA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. M.

God! There is no god but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal.

It is He Who sent down to you, in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).

Those who reject faith in the Signs of God will suffer the severest penalty, and God is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution.

From God, nothing is hidden on earth or in the heavens.

He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.

He it is Who has sent down to you the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental; they are the foundation of the Book. Others are allegorical. Those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part that is allegorical, seeking discord and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except God. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord." None will grasp the message except men of understanding.

"Our Lord!" they say, "Let not our hearts deviate now after You have guided us, but grant us mercy from Your Presence; for You are the Grantor of bounties without measure.""Our Lord! You are the Gatherer of mankind on a day about which there is no doubt; God never fails in His promise."

Those who reject faith, neither their possessions nor their progeny will avail them against God; they are but fuel for the Fire. Their plight will be like that of the people of Pharaoh and their predecessors: they denied our Signs, and God called them to account for their sins. God is strict in punishment.

Say to those who reject faith: "Soon you will be vanquished and gathered together to Hell, an evil bed indeed to lie on!" There has already been a sign in the two armies that met in combat: one fighting in the cause of God, the other resisting God; they saw with their own eyes twice their number. But God supports with His aid whom He pleases. In this is a warning for those who have eyes to see.

Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet: women, sons, hoards of gold and silver, horses, cattle, and well-tilled land. These are the possessions of this world's life, but in nearness to God is the best of goals. Say: "Shall I give you glad tidings of things far better than those? For the righteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord, with rivers flowing beneath; therein is their eternal home; with pure companions and the good pleasure of God. For in God's sight are all His servants."

Those who say: "Our Lord! We have indeed believed: forgive us our sins and save us from the agony of the Fire;" those who show patience, firmness, and self-control; who are true in word and deed; who worship devoutly; who spend in the way of God; and who pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning.

There is no god but He: that is the witness of God, His angels, and those endowed with knowledge, standing firm on justice. The religion before God is Islam (submission to His will). Those who received the Scripture differed only after knowledge came to them, through transgression among themselves. Whoever disbelieves in the revelations of God will find that God is swift in calling to account.

If they dispute with you, say: "I have submitted my whole self to God and so have those who follow me." Say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: "Do you submit yourselves?" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, your duty is to convey the message; in God's sight are all His servants.

As for those who deny the Signs of God and in defiance of right, slay the prophets and those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty. They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.

Have you not seen those who have been given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God to settle their dispute, but a party of them turns back and declines the arbitration. This is because they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days." Their forgeries deceive them as to their own religion.

But how will they fare when we gather them together against a day about which there is no doubt, and each soul will be paid out just what it has earned, without injustice?

Say: "O God! Lord of Power and Rule, You give power to whom You please, and You strip off power from whom You please; You endow with honor whom You please, and You bring low whom You please. In Your hand is all good. Verily, over all things You have power."Y: Remember that morning Thou didst leave Thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And God heareth and knoweth all things. P: And when thou settedst forth at daybreak from thy housefolk to assign to the believers their positions for the battle, God was Hearer, Knower. S: And when you did go forth early in the morning from your family to lodge the believers in encampments for war and God is Hearing, Knowing.

003.122 Y: Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice; but God was their protector, and in God should the faithful (Ever) put their trust. P: When two parties of you almost fell away, and God was their Protecting Friend. In God let believers put their trust. S: When two parties from among you had determined that they should show cowardice, and God was the guardian of them both, and in God should the believers trust.

003.123 Y: God had helped you at Badr, when ye were a contemptible little force; then fear God; thus may ye show your gratitude. P: God had already given you the victory at Badr, when ye were contemptible. So observe your duty to God in order that ye may be thankful. S: And God did certainly assist you at Badr when you were weak; be careful of (your duty to) God then, that you may give thanks.

003.124 Y: Remember thou saidst to the Faithful: Is it not enough for you that God should help you with three thousand angels (Specially) sent down? P: When thou didst say unto the believers: Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should support you with three thousand angels sent down (to your help)? S: When you said to the believers: Does it not suffice you that your Lord should assist you with three thousand of the angels sent down?

003.125 Y: "Yea, - if ye remain firm, and act aright, even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste, your Lord would help you with five thousand angels Making a terrific onslaught." P: Nay, but if ye persevere, and keep from evil, and (the enemy) attack you suddenly, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels sweeping on. S: Yea! if you remain patient and are on your guard, and they come upon you in a headlong manner, your Lord will assist you with five thousand of the havoc-making angels.

003.126 Y: God made it but a message of hope for you, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from God. The Exalted, the Wise. P: God ordained this only as a message of good cheer for you, and that thereby your hearts might be at rest - Victory cometh only from God, the Mighty, the Wise. S: And God did not make it but as good news for you, and that your hearts might be at ease thereby, and victory is only from God, the Mighty, the Wise.

003.127 Y: That He might cut off a fringe of the Unbelievers or expose them to infamy, and they should then be turned back, frustrated of their purpose. P: That He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve, or overwhelm them so that they retire, frustrated. S: That He may cut off a portion from among those who disbelieve, or abase them so that they should return disappointed of attaining what they desired.

003.128 Y: Not for thee, (but for God), is the decision: Whether He turn in mercy to them, or punish them; for they are indeed wrong-doers. P: It is no concern at all of thee (Muhammad) whether He relent toward them or punish them; for they are evil-doers. S: You have no concern in the affair whether He turns to them (mercifully) or chastises them, for surely they are unjust.

003.129 Y: To God belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth; but God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. He forgiveth whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is God's; He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases; and God is Forgiving, Merciful.

003.130 Y: O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; but fear God; that ye may (really) prosper. P: O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubling and quadrupling (the sum lent). Observe your duty to God, that ye may be successful. S: O you who believe! do not devour usury, making it double and redouble, and be careful of (your duty to) God, that you may be successful.

003.131 Y: Fear the Fire, which is prepared for those who reject Faith. P: And ward off (from yourselves) the Fire prepared for disbelievers. S: And guard yourselves against the fire which has been prepared for the unbelievers.

003.132 Y: And obey God and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy. P: And obey God and the messenger, that ye may find mercy. S: And obey God and the Messenger, that you may be shown mercy.

003.133 Y: Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose width is that (of the whole) of the heavens and of the earth, prepared for the righteous. P: And vie one with another for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a paradise as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who ward off (evil). S: And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord; and a Garden, the extensiveness of which is (as) the heavens and the earth, it is prepared for those who guard (against evil).

003.134 Y: Those who spend (freely), whether in prosperity, or in adversity; who restrain anger, and pardon (all) men; for God loves those who do good. P: Those who spend (of that which God hath given them) in ease and in adversity, those who control their wrath and are forgiving toward mankind; God loveth the good. S: Those who spend (benevolently) in ease as well as in straitness, and those who restrain (their) anger and pardon men; and God loves the doers of good (to others).

003.135 Y: And those who, having done something to be ashamed of, or wronged their own souls, earnestly bring God to mind, and ask for forgiveness for their sins; and who can forgive sins except God? and are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in (the wrong) they have done. P: And those who, when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves, remember God and implore forgiveness for their sins - Who forgiveth sins save God only? - and will not knowingly repeat (the wrong) they did. S: And those who when they commit an indecency or do injustice to their souls remember God and ask forgiveness for their faults and who forgives the faults but God, and (who) do not knowingly persist in what they have done.

003.136 Y: For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath, an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive)! P: The reward of such will be forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever - a bountiful reward for workers! S: (As for) these their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and excellent is the reward of the laborers.

003.137 Y: Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth. P: Systems have passed away before you. Do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for those who did deny (the messengers). S: Indeed there have been examples before you; therefore travel in the earth and see what was the end of the rejecters.

003.138 Y: Here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those who fear God! P: This is a declaration for mankind, a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil). S: This is a clear statement for men, and a guidance and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).

003.139 Y: So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith. P: Faint not nor grieve, for ye will overcome them if ye are (indeed) believers. S: And be not infirm, and be not grieving, and you shall have the upper hand if you are believers.

003.140 Y: If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others. Such days (of varying fortunes) We give to men and men by turns: that God may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to Truth). And God loveth not those that do wrong. P: If ye have received a blow, the (disbelieving) people have received a blow the like thereof. These are (only) the vicissitudes which We cause to follow one another for mankind, to the end that God may know those who believe and may choose witnesses from among you; and God loveth not wrong-doers. S: If a wound has afflicted you (at Ohud), a wound like it has also afflicted the (unbelieving) people; and We bring these days to men by turns, and that God may know those who believe and take witnesses from among you; and God does not love the unjust.

003.141 Y: God's object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing Those that resist Faith. P: And that God may prove those who believe, and may blight the disbelievers. S: And that He may purge those who believe and deprive the unbelievers of blessings.

003.142 Y: Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without God testing those of you who fought hard (In His Cause) and remained steadfast? P: Or deemed ye that ye would enter paradise while yet God knoweth not those of you who really strive, nor knoweth those (of you) who are steadfast? S: Do you think that you will enter the garden while God has not yet known those who strive hard from among you, and (He has not) known the patient.

003.143 Y: Ye did indeed wish for death before ye met him: Now ye have seen him with your own eyes, (And ye flinch!) P: And verily ye used to wish for death before ye met it (in the field). Now ye have seen it with your eyes! S: And certainly you desired death before you met it, so indeed you have seen it and you look (at it).

003.144 Y: Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to God; but God (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude. P: Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed away before him. Will it be that, when he dieth or is slain, ye will turn back on your heels? He who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to God, and God will reward the thankful. S: And Muhammad is no more than a messenger; the messengers have already passed away before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels, he will by no means do harm to God in the least and God will reward the grateful.

003.145 Y: Nor can a soul die except by God's leave, the term being fixed as by writ.Say: "O God, Master of the Kingdom! You give the kingdom to whom You please and take it away from whom You please. You exalt whom You please and abase whom You please. In Your hand is all good; surely, You have power over all things. You cause the night to pass into the day and the day to pass into the night. You bring forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, and You give sustenance to whom You please without measure."

Let not the believers take disbelievers for friends in preference to believers. Whoever does this has no connection with God unless it is to guard yourselves against them. God cautions you to remember Himself; for the final goal is to God. Say: "Whether you hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, God knows it all. He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and God has power over all things."

On the Day when every soul will be confronted with all the good it has done and all the evil it has done, it will wish there were a great distance between it and its evil. But God cautions you to remember Himself. And God is full of kindness to those who serve Him. Say: "If you love God, follow me; God will love you and forgive your sins. For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." Say: "Obey God and His Messenger." But if they turn back, God does not love those who reject faith.

God chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people. They were descendants one of another. God hears and knows all things. When the wife of 'Imran said: "O my Lord! I dedicate unto You what is in my womb for Your special service. So accept this from me; for You hear and know all things." When she was delivered, she said: "O my Lord! I am delivered of a female child!" And God knew best what she brought forth. "And no wise is the male like the female. I have named her Mary, and I commend her and her offspring to Your protection from the Evil One, the Rejected."

Right graciously did her Lord accept her. He made her grow in purity and beauty and assigned her to the care of Zakariya. Every time he entered her chamber, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: "O Mary! Whence comes this to you?" She said: "From God. For God provides sustenance to whom He pleases without measure." There did Zakariya pray to his Lord, saying: "O my Lord! Grant unto me from You a progeny that is pure. For You are He that hears prayer."

While he was standing in prayer in the chamber, the angels called unto him: "God gives you glad tidings of Yahya, witnessing the truth of a Word from God, noble, chaste, and a prophet of the righteous." He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, seeing I am very old and my wife is barren?" "Thus," was the answer, "God accomplishes what He wills." He said: "O my Lord! Give me a sign!" "Your sign," was the answer, "shall be that you shall speak to no man for three days but with signals. Then celebrate the praises of your Lord again and again and glorify Him in the evening and in the morning."

Behold! The angels said: "O Mary! God has chosen you and purified you, chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary! Worship your Lord devoutly, prostrate yourself, and bow down in prayer with those who bow down." This is part of the tidings of the unseen, which We reveal unto you by inspiration. You were not with them when they cast lots with arrows as to which of them should be charged with the care of Mary, nor were you with them when they disputed the point."when they contended one with another. Behold! the angels said: 'O Mary! God gives you glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honor in this world and the Hereafter and of those nearest to God.' He shall speak to the people in childhood and in maturity and shall be of the righteous. She said: 'O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: 'Even so: God creates what He wills. When He decrees a plan, He but says to it, "Be," and it is!' And God will teach him the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel. And (appoint him) a messenger to the Children of Israel, with this message: 'I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord, in that I make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by God's leave. I heal those born blind, and the lepers, and I quicken the dead, by God's leave; and I declare to you what you eat and what you store in your houses. Surely therein is a Sign for you if you believe.' (I have come to you) to attest the Law which was before me and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord. So fear God, and obey me. It is God Who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a Way that is straight. When Jesus found unbelief on their part, He said: 'Who will be my helpers to the work of God?' Said the disciples: 'We are God's helpers: We believe in God, and do you bear witness that we are Muslims.' Our Lord! We believe in what You have revealed, and we follow the Messenger; then write us down among those who bear witness. And the unbelievers plotted and planned, and God too planned, and the best of planners is God. Behold! God said: 'O Jesus! I will take you and raise you to Myself and clear you of the falsehoods of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow you superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection. Then shall you all return to Me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein you dispute.' As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help. As to those who believe and work righteousness, God will pay them in full their reward; but God loves not those who do wrong. This is what we rehearse unto you of the Signs and the Message of Wisdom. The similitude of Jesus before God is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: 'Be,' and he was. The Truth comes from God alone; so be not of those who doubt. If anyone disputes in this matter with you, now after full knowledge has come to you, say: 'Come! Let us gather together, our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves. Then let us earnestly pray and invoke the curse of God on those who lie!' This is the true account: There is no god except God; and God is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. But if they turn back, God has full knowledge of those who do mischief. Say: 'O People of the Book! Come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but God; that we associate no partners with Him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than God.' If then they turn back, say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims (bowing to God's Will).' Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel were not revealed till after him?"O People of the Book! Why do you argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Have you no understanding? You argue about matters of which you have some knowledge, but why dispute in matters of which you have no knowledge? God knows, and you do not. Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian; he was true in faith and submitted to God, and he did not associate others with God. The nearest of kin to Abraham are those who follow him, as well as this Prophet and those who believe. God is the Protector of those who have faith.

A section of the People of the Book wishes to lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray without realizing it. O People of the Book! Why do you reject the signs of God, of which you are witnesses? Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth knowingly?

A group among the People of the Book says: "Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers, but reject it at the end of the day, so they may turn back." They say: "Believe only in those who follow your religion." Say: "True guidance is the guidance of God." God grants His bounty to whom He pleases, and He is All-Knowing.

Among the People of the Book, some are trustworthy with a hoard of gold, while others will not repay even a single coin unless you constantly demand it. They say: "There is no obligation on us to keep faith with these ignorant people." They lie against God knowingly. Those who keep their promises and act righteously, God loves them.

Those who sell their faith and their oaths for a small price will have no portion in the Hereafter. God will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them. They will have a grievous penalty. Some distort the Book with their tongues, making it seem like it is from God, but it is not. They lie against God knowingly.

It is not possible for a man given the Book, wisdom, and prophethood to say to people: "Be my worshippers rather than God's." Instead, he would say: "Be worshippers of God because you have taught the Book and studied it earnestly." Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets as lords. Would he command you to disbelieve after you have submitted to God?

God took the covenant of the prophets, saying: "I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes a messenger confirming what is with you. Do you believe in him and render him help?" They said: "We agree." God said: "Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses." If any turn back after this, they are the transgressors.ting. If any do desire a reward in this life, We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve us with) gratitude. P: No soul can ever die except by God's leave and at a term appointed. Whoso desireth the reward of the world, We bestow on him thereof; and whoso desireth the reward of the Hereafter, We bestow on him thereof. We shall reward the thankful. S: And a soul will not die but with the permission of God the term is fixed; and whoever desires the reward of this world, I shall give him of it, and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter I shall give him of it, and I will reward the grateful.

003.146 Y: How many of the prophets fought (in God's way), and with them (fought) Large bands of godly men? but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in God's way, nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And God Loves those who are firm and steadfast. P: And with how many a prophet have there been a number of devoted men who fought (beside him). They quailed not for aught that befell them in the way of God, nor did they weaken, nor were they brought low. God loveth the steadfast. S: And how many a prophet has fought with whom were many worshippers of the Lord; so they did not become weak-hearted on account of what befell them in God's way, nor did they weaken, nor did they abase themselves; and God loves the patient.

003.147 Y: All that they said was: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything We may have done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly, and help us against those that resist Faith." P: Their cry was only that they said: Our Lord! forgive us for our sins and wasted efforts, make our foothold sure, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk. S: And their saying was no other than that they said: Our Lord! forgive us our faults and our extravagance in our affair and make firm our feet and help us against the unbelieving people.

003.148 Y: And God gave them a reward in this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For God Loveth those who do good. P: So God gave them the reward of the world and the good reward of the Hereafter. God loveth those whose deeds are good. S: So God gave them the reward of this world and better reward of the hereafter and God loves those who do good (to others).

003.149 Y: O ye who believe! If ye obey the Unbelievers, they will drive you back on your heels, and ye will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss. P: O ye who believe! if ye obey those who disbelieve, they will make you turn back on your heels, and ye turn back as losers. S: O you who believe! if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back upon your heels, so you will turn back losers.

003.150 Y: Nay, God is your protector, and He is the best of helpers. P: But God is your Protector, and He is the Best of Helpers. S: Nay! God is your Patron and He is the best of the helpers.

003.151 Y: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with God, for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers! P: We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they ascribe unto God partners, for which no warrant hath been revealed. Their habitation is the Fire, and hapless the abode of the wrong-doers. S: We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they set up with God that for which He has sent down no authority, and their abode is the fire, and evil is the abode of the unjust.

003.152 Y: God did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you: For God is full of grace to those who believe. P: God verily made good His promise unto you when ye routed them by His leave, until (the moment) when your courage failed you, and ye disagreed about the order and ye disobeyed, after He had shown you that for which ye long. Some of you desired the world, and some of you desired the Hereafter. Therefore He made you flee from them, that He might try you. Yet now He hath forgiven you. God is a Lord of Kindness to believers. S: And certainly God made good to you His promise when you slew them by His permission, until when you became weak-hearted and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you loved; of you were some who desired this world and of you were some who desired the hereafter; then He turned you away from them that He might try you; and He has certainly pardoned you, and God is Gracious to the believers.

003.153 Y: Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a side glance at any one, and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. There did God give you one distress after another by way of requital, to teach you not to grieve for (the booty) that had escaped you and for (the ill) that had befallen you. For God is well aware of all that ye do. P: When ye climbed (the hill) and paid no heed to anyone, while the messenger, in your rear, was calling you (to fight). Therefore He rewarded you grief for (his) grief, that (He might teach) you not to sorrow either for that which ye missed or for that which befell you. God is Informed of what ye do. S: When you ran off precipitately and did not wait for any one, and the Messenger was calling you from your rear, so He gave you another sorrow instead of (your) sorrow, so that you might not grieve at what had escaped you, nor (at) what befell you; and God is aware of what you do.

003.154 Y: After (the excitement) of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings, Moved by wrong suspicions of God-suspicions due to ignorance. They said: "What affair is this of ours?" Say thou: "Indeed, this affair is wholly God's." They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): "If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death"; but (all this was) that God might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For God knoweth well the secrets of your hearts. P: Then, after grief, He sent down security for you. As slumber did it overcome a party of you, while (the other) party, who were anxious on their own account, thought wrongly of God, the thought of ignorance. They said: Have we any part in the cause? Say (O Muhammad): The cause belongeth wholly to God. They hide within themselves (a thought) which they reveal not unto thee, saying: Had we had any part in the cause we should not have been slain here. Say: Even though ye had been in your houses, those appointed to be slain would have gone forth to the places where they were to lie. (All this hath been) in order that God might try what is in your breasts and prove what is in your hearts. God is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of men). S: Then after sorrow He sent down security upon you, a calm coming upon a party of you, and (there was) another party whom their own souls had rendered anxious; they entertained about God thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly, saying: We have no hand in the affair. Say: Surely the affair is wholly (in the hands) of God. They conceal within their souls what they would not reveal to you. They say: Had we any hand in the affair, we would not have been slain here. Say: Had you remained in your houses, those for whom slaughter was ordained would certainly have gone forth to the places where they would be slain, and that God might test what was in your breasts and that He might purge what was in your hearts; and God knows what is in the breasts.

003.155 Y: Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts Met,-it was Satan who caused them to fail, because of some (evil) they had done. But God Has blotted out (their fault): For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. P: Lo! those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met, Satan alone it was who caused them to backslide, because of some of that which they have earned. Now God hath forgiven them. Lo! God is Forgiving, Clement. S: (As for) those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met, only the Shaitan sought to cause them to make a slip on account of some deeds they had done, and certainly God has pardoned them; surely God is Forgiving, Forbearing.

003.156 Y: O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain." This that God may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is God that gives Life and Death, and God sees well all that ye do. P: O ye who believe! Be not as those who disbelieved and said of their brethren who went abroad in the land or were fighting in the field: If they had been (here) with us they would not have died or been killed: that God may make it anguish in their hearts. God giveth life and causeth death; and God is Seer of what ye do. S: O you who believe! be not like those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in fighting: Had they been with us, they would not have died and they would not have been slain; so God makes this to be an intense regret in their hearts; and God gives life and causes death and God sees what you do.

003.157 Y: And if ye are slain, or die, in the way of God, forgiveness and mercy from God are far better than all they could amass. P: And what though ye be slain in God's way or die therein? Surely pardon from God and mercy are better than all that they amass. S: And if you are slain in the way of God or you die, certainly forgiveness from God and mercy is better than what they amass.

003.158 Y: And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! it is unto God that ye are brought together. P: What though ye be slain or die, when unto God ye are gathered? S: And if indeed you die or you are slain, certainly to God shall you be gathered together.

003.159 Y: It is part of the Mercy of God that thou dost deal gently with them Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (Their faults), and ask for (God's) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then, when thou hast Taken a decision put thy trust in God."Whoever therefore turns back after this, these are the transgressors. Do they seek for other than the Religion of God, while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will? Say: 'We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in the Books given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord. We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will.' If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter, he will be among those who have lost. How shall God guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come to them? God guides not a people unjust. Their reward is the curse of God, His angels, and all mankind. They will dwell in it; their penalty will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved, except for those who repent and make amends. God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. But those who reject Faith after they accepted it and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith, their repentance will not be accepted. They are those who have gone astray. Those who reject Faith and die rejecting, never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains, though they should offer it for ransom. For such is a grievous penalty, and they will find no helpers. By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you give freely of that which you love; and whatever you give, God knows it well. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel made unlawful for itself before the Law of Moses was revealed. Say: 'Bring the Law and study it if you are men of truth.' If any, after this, invent a lie and attribute it to God, they are indeed unjust wrong-doers. Say: 'God speaks the Truth: follow the religion of Abraham, the sane in faith; he was not of the Pagans.' The first House of worship appointed for men was that at Bakka, full of blessing and guidance for all kinds of beings. In it are Signs Manifest; the Station of Abraham; whoever enters it attains security. Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to God, those who can afford the journey. If any deny faith, God stands not in need of any of His creatures. Say: 'O People of the Book! Why reject the Signs of God, when God is Himself witness to all you do?' Say: 'O People of the Book! Why obstruct those who believe from the path of God, seeking to make it crooked, while you were yourselves witnesses to God's Covenant? God is not unmindful of all that you do.' O you who believe! If you listen to a faction among the People of the Book, they would render you apostates after you have believed. How would you deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs of God, and among you lives the Messenger? Whoever holds firmly to God will be shown a way that is straight. O you who believe! Fear God as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam. And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude God's favor on you; for you were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, you became brethren; and you were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does God make His Signs clear to you: That you may be guided."(how) ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire, and He did save you from it. Thus God makes clear His revelations unto you, that you may be guided. And hold fast by the covenant of God all together and be not disunited, and remember the favor of God on you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts so by His favor you became brethren; and you were on the brink of a pit of fire, then He saved you from it. Thus does God make clear to you His communications that you may follow the right way.

Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity. And there may spring from you a nation who invite to goodness, and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency. Such are they who are successful. And from among you there should be a party who invite to good and enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong, and these it is that shall be successful.

Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty. And be ye not as those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs had come unto them. For such there is an awful doom. And be not like those who became divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them, and these it is that shall have a grievous chastisement.

On the Day when some faces will be lit up with white, and some faces will be in the gloom of black: To those whose faces will be black, it will be said: "Did ye reject Faith after accepting it? Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith." On the Day when some faces will be whitened and some faces will be blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it will be said unto them: Disbelieved ye after your profession of belief? Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved. On the day when some faces shall turn white and some faces shall turn black; then as to those whose faces turn black: Did you disbelieve after your believing? Taste therefore the chastisement because you disbelieved.

But those whose faces will be lit with white, they will be in the light of God's mercy: therein to dwell forever. And as for those whose faces have been whitened, in the mercy of God they dwell forever. And as to those whose faces turn white, they shall be in God's mercy; in it they shall abide.

These are the Signs of God: We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And God means no injustice to any of His creatures. These are revelations of God. We recite them unto thee in truth. God wills no injustice to His creatures. These are the communications of God which We recite to you with truth, and God does not desire any injustice to the creatures.

To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Him do all questions go back for decision. Unto God belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; and unto God all things are returned. And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is God's; and to God all things return.

Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in God. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors. Ye are the best community that has been raised up for mankind. Ye enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in God. And if the People of the Scripture had believed it had been better for them. Some of them are believers; but most of them are evil-livers. You are the best of the nations raised up for the benefit of men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them some are believers and most of them are transgressors.

They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out to fight you, they will show you their backs, and no help shall they get. They will not harm you save a trifling hurt, and if they fight against you they will turn and flee. And afterward they will not be helped. They shall by no means harm you but with a slight evil; and if they fight with you they shall turn their backs to you, then shall they not be helped.

Shame is pitched over them like a tent wherever they are found, except when under a covenant of protection from God and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from God, and pitched over them is the tent of destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of God, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds. Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save where they grasp a rope from God and a rope from men. They have incurred anger from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is because they used to disbelieve the revelations of God, and slew the prophets wrongfully. That is because they were rebellious and used to transgress. Abasement is made to cleave to them wherever they are found, except under a covenant with God and a covenant with men, and they have become deserving of wrath from God, and humiliation is made to cleave to them; this is because they disbelieved in the communications of God and slew the prophets unjustly; this is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.

Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand for the right: They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They are not all alike. Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch community who recite the revelations of God in the night season, falling prostrate before Him. They are not all alike; of the followers of the Book there is an upright party; they recite God's communications in the nighttime and they adore Him.

They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten in emulation in all good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous. They believe in God and the Last Day, and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency, and vie one with another in good works. These are of the righteous. They believe in God and the last day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and they strive with one another in hastening to good deeds, and those are among the good.

Of the good that they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for God knows well those that do right. And whatever good they do, they will not be denied the meed thereof. God is Aware of those who ward off evil. And whatever good they do, they shall not be denied it, and God knows those who guard against evil.

Those who reject Faith, neither their possessions nor their numerous progeny will avail them aught against God: They will be companions of the Fire, dwelling therein forever. Lo! the riches and the progeny of those who disbelieve will not avail them aught against God; and such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. As for those who disbelieve, surely neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them in the least against God; and these are the inmates of the fire; therein they shall abide.

What they spend in the life of this material world may be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not God that has wronged them, but they wrong themselves. The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the likeness of a biting, icy wind which smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves, and devastates it. God wronged them not, but they do wrong themselves. The likeness of what they spend in the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense cold that smites the seed produce of a people who have done injustice to their souls and destroys it; and God is not unjust to them, but they are unjust to themselves.

O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom. O ye who believe! Take not for intimates others than your own folk, who would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you. Hatred is revealed by the utterance of their mouths, but that which their breasts hide is greater. We have made plain for you the revelations if ye will understand. O you who believe! do not take for intimate friends from among others than your own people; they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon you; they love what distresses you; vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still; indeed, We have made the communications clear to you, if you will understand.

Ah! ye are those who love them, but they love you not, though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe": But when they are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: "Perish in your rage; God knows well all the secrets of the heart." Lo! ye are those who love them though they love you not, and ye believe in all the Scripture. When they fall in with you they say: We believe; but when they go apart they bite their finger-tips at you, for rage. Say: Perish in your rage! Lo! God is Aware of what is hidden in your breasts. Lo! you are they who will love them while they do not love you, and you believe in the Book in the whole of it; and when they meet you they say: We believe, and when they are alone, they bite the ends of their fingers in rage against you. Say: Die in your rage; surely God knows what is in the breasts.

If aught that is good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if ye are constant and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for God encompasses round about all that they do. If a lucky chance befall you, it is evil unto them, and if disaster strike you they rejoice thereat. But if ye persevere and keep from evil their guile will never harm you. Lo! God is Surrounding what they do. If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if an evil afflicts you, they rejoice at it; and if you are patient and guard yourselves, their scheme will not injure you in any way; surely God comprehends what they do."or God loves those who put their trust (in Him). P: It was by the mercy of God that thou wast lenient with them (O Muhammad), for if thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from round about thee. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult with them upon the conduct of affairs. And when thou art resolved, then put thy trust in God. Lo! God loveth those who put their trust (in Him). S: Thus it is due to mercy from God that you deal with them gently, and had you been rough, hard-hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them, and take counsel with them in the affair; so when you have decided, then place your trust in God; surely God loves those who trust.

003.160 Y: If God helps you, none can overcome you: If He forsakes you, who is there, after that, that can help you? In God, then, let believers put their trust. P: If God is your helper none can overcome you, and if He withdraws His help from you, who is there who can help you after Him? In God let believers put their trust. S: If God assists you, then there is none that can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there then that can assist you after Him? And on God should the believers rely.

003.161 Y: No prophet could (ever) be false to his trust. If any person is so false, He shall, on the Day of Judgment, restore what he misappropriated; then shall every soul receive its due,- whatever it earned,- and none shall be dealt with unjustly. P: It is not for any prophet to embezzle. Whoso embezzles will bring what he embezzled with him on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full what it has earned; and they will not be wronged. S: And it is not attributable to a prophet that he should act unfaithfully; and he who acts unfaithfully shall bring that in respect of which he has acted unfaithfully on the day of resurrection; then shall every soul be paid back fully what it has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.

003.162 Y: Is the man who follows the good pleasure of God like the man who draws on himself the wrath of God, and whose abode is in Hell?- A woeful refuge! P: Is one who follows the pleasure of God as one who has earned condemnation from God, whose habitation is the Fire, a hapless journey's end? S: Is then he who follows the pleasure of God like him who has made himself deserving of displeasure from God, and his abode is hell; and it is an evil destination.

003.163 Y: They are in varying gardens in the sight of God, and God sees well all that they do. P: There are degrees (of grace and reprobation) with God, and God is Seer of what they do. S: There are (varying) grades with God, and God sees what they do.

003.164 Y: God did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them the Signs of God, sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, while, before that, they had been in manifest error. P: God verily has shown grace to the believers by sending unto them a messenger of their own who recites unto them His revelations, and causes them to grow, and teaches them the Scripture and wisdom; although before (he came to them) they were in flagrant error. S: Certainly God conferred a benefit upon the believers when He raised among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His communications and purifying them, and teaching them the Book and the wisdom, although before that they were surely in manifest error.

003.165 Y: What! When a single disaster smites you, although ye smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, do ye say?- "Whence is this?" Say (to them): "It is from yourselves: For God hath power over all things." P: And was it so, when a disaster smote you, though ye had smitten (them with a disaster) twice (as great), that ye said: How is this? Say (unto them, O Muhammad): It is from yourselves. Lo! God is Able to do all things. S: What! when a misfortune befell you, and you had certainly afflicted (the unbelievers) with twice as much, you began to say: Whence is this? Say: It is from yourselves; surely God has power over all things.

003.166 Y: What ye suffered on the day the two armies met, was with the leave of God, in order that He might test the believers,- P: That which befell you, on the day when the two armies met, was by permission of God; that He might know the true believers; S: And what befell you on the day when the two armies met (at Ohud) was with God's knowledge, and that He might know the believers.

003.167 Y: And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come, fight in the way of God, or (at least) drive (The foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but God hath full knowledge of all they conceal. P: And that He might know the hypocrites, unto whom it was said: Come, fight in the way of God, or defend yourselves. They answered: If we knew aught of fighting we would follow you. On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith. They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts. God is Best Aware of what they hide. S: And that He might know the hypocrites; and it was said to them: Come, fight in God's way, or defend yourselves. They said: If we knew fighting, we would certainly have followed you. They were on that day much nearer to unbelief than to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and God best knows what they conceal.

003.168 Y: (They are) the ones that say, (of their brethren slain), while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth." P: Those who, while they sat at home, said of their brethren (who were fighting for the cause of God): If they had been guided by us they would not have been slain. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Then avert death from yourselves if you are truthful. S: Those who said of their brethren whilst they (themselves) held back: Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed. Say: Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth.

003.169 Y: Think not of those who are slain in God's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord; P: Think not of those, who are slain in the way of God, as dead. Nay, they are living. With their Lord they have provision. S: And reckon not those who are killed in God's way as dead; nay, they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their Lord;

003.170 Y: They rejoice in the bounty provided by God: And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (Martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve. P: Jubilant (are they) because of that which God has bestowed upon them of His bounty, rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind: That there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. S: Rejoicing in what God has given them out of His grace and they rejoice for the sake of those who, (being left) behind them, have not yet joined them, that they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.

003.171 Y: They glory in the Grace and the bounty from God, and in the fact that God suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least). P: They rejoice because of favour from God and kindness, and that God wasteth not the wage of the believers. S: They rejoice on account of favor from God and (His) grace, and that God will not waste the reward of the believers.

003.172 Y: Of those who answered the call of God and the Messenger, even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward;- P: As for those who heard the call of God and His messenger after the harm befell them (in the fight); for such of them as do right and ward off (evil), there is great reward. S: (As for) those who responded (at Ohud) to the call of God and the Messenger after the wound had befallen them, those among them who do good (to others) and guard (against evil) shall have a great reward.

003.173 Y: Men said to them: "A great army is gathering against you": And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: "For us God sufficeth, and He is the best disposer of affairs." P: Those unto whom men said: Lo! the people have gathered against you, therefore fear them. (The threat of danger) but increased the faith of them and they cried: God is Sufficient for us! Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust! S: Those to whom the people said: Surely men have gathered against you, therefore fear them, but this increased their faith, and they said: God is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector.

003.174 Y: And they returned with Grace and bounty from God: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of God: And God is the Lord of bounties unbounded. P: So they returned with grace and favour from God, and no harm touched them. They followed the good pleasure of God, and God is of Infinite Bounty. S: So they returned with favor from God and (His) grace, no evil touched them and they followed the pleasure of God; and God is the Lord of mighty grace.

003.175 Y: It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them, but fear Me, if ye have Faith. P: It is only the devil who would make (men) fear his partisans. Fear them not; fear Me, if you are true believers. S: It is only the Shaitan that causes you to fear from his friends, but do not fear them, and fear Me if you are believers.

003.176 Y: Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to God: God's plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment. P: Let not their conduct grieve thee, who run easily to disbelief, for lo! they injure God not at all. It is God's Will to assign them no portion in the Hereafter, and theirs will be an awful doom. S: And let not those grieve you who fall into unbelief hastily; surely they can do no harm to God at all; God intends that He should not give them any portion in the hereafter, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.

003.177 Y: Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith,- not the least harm will they do to God, but they will have a grievous punishment. P: Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith harm God not at all, but theirs will be a painful doom. S: Surely those who have bought unbelief at the price of faith shall do no harm at all to God, and they shall have a painful chastisement.Remember that morning you left your household early to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And God hears and knows all things. Remember two of your parties meditated cowardice; but God was their protector, and in God should the faithful put their trust. God helped you at Badr when you were a contemptible little force; then fear God; thus may you show your gratitude. Remember you said to the Faithful: Is it not enough for you that God should help you with three thousand angels sent down? Yea, if you remain firm and act aright, even if the enemy should rush on you in hot haste, your Lord would help you with five thousand angels making a terrific onslaught. God made it a message of hope for you, and an assurance to your hearts: there is no help except from God, the Exalted, the Wise. That He might cut off a fringe of the Unbelievers or expose them to infamy, and they should then be turned back, frustrated of their purpose. Not for you, but for God, is the decision: Whether He turns in mercy to them or punishes them; for they are indeed wrong-doers. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases; but God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. O you who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; but fear God; that you may prosper. Fear the Fire, which is prepared for those who reject Faith. And obey God and the Messenger; that you may obtain mercy. Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose width is that of the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous. Those who spend freely, whether in prosperity or adversity; who restrain anger and pardon all men; for God loves those who do good. And those who, having done something to be ashamed of, or wronged their own souls, earnestly bring God to mind, and ask for forgiveness for their sins, and who can forgive sins except God? And are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in the wrong they have done. For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath, an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work and strive! Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth. Here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those who fear God. So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For you must gain mastery if you are true in Faith. If a wound has touched you, be sure a similar wound has touched the others. Such days of varying fortunes We give to men by turns: that God may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses to Truth. And God loves not those that do wrong. God's object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing those that resist Faith. Did you think that you would enter Heaven without God testing those of you who fought hard in His Cause and remained steadfast? You did indeed wish for death before you met him: Now you have seen him with your own eyes, and you flinch! Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many were the messengers that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will you then turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to God; but God will swiftly reward those who serve Him with gratitude. Nor can a soul die except by God's leave, the term being fixed as by writing.If any do desire a reward in this life, We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that serve with gratitude. No soul can ever die except by God's leave and at a term appointed. Whoever desires the reward of this world, We bestow on him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We bestow on him thereof. We shall reward the thankful. How many of the prophets fought in God's way, and with them large bands of godly men? They never lost heart if they met with disaster in God's way, nor did they weaken in will nor give in. God loves those who are firm and steadfast. Their cry was only: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything we may have done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly, and help us against those that resist Faith." So God gave them the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For God loves those who do good. O you who believe! If you obey the Unbelievers, they will drive you back on your heels, and you will turn back from Faith to your own loss. But God is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers. Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for they joined companions with God, for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers! God did indeed fulfill His promise to you when you, with His permission, were about to annihilate your enemy, until you flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight of the booty which you covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you: For God is full of grace to those who believe. Behold! You were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a side glance at anyone, and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. There did God give you one distress after another by way of requital, to teach you not to grieve for the booty that had escaped you and for the ill that had befallen you. For God is well aware of all that you do. After the excitement of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings, moved by wrong suspicions of God—suspicions due to ignorance. They said: "What affair is this of ours?" Say: "Indeed, this affair is wholly God's." They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to you. They say to themselves: "If we had had anything to do with this affair, we should not have been in the slaughter here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death"; but all this was that God might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For God knows well the secrets of your hearts. Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met, it was Satan who caused them to fail, because of some evil they had done. But God has blotted out their fault: For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. O you who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are traveling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain." This is that God may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is God that gives Life and Death, and God sees well all that you do. And if you are slain, or die, in the way of God, forgiveness and mercy from God are far better than all they could amass. And if you die, or are slain, it is unto God that you are brought together. It is part of the Mercy of God that you deal gently with them. Were you severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you: so pass over their faults, and ask for God's forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs of moment. Then, when you have taken a decision, put your trust in God.pite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment. P: And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodeth good unto their souls. We only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness. And theirs will be a shameful doom. S: And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for their souls; We grant them respite only that they may add to their sins; and they shall have a disgraceful chastisement.

003.179 Y: God will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now, until He separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers (For the purpose) whom He pleases. So believe in God. And His messengers: And if ye believe and do right, ye have a reward without measure. P: It is not (the purpose) of God to leave you in your present state till He shall separate the wicked from the good. And it is not (the purpose of) God to let you know the Unseen. But God chooseth of His messengers whom He will, (to receive knowledge thereof). So believe in God and His messengers. If ye believe and ward off (evil), yours will be a vast reward. S: On no account will God leave the believers in the condition which you are in until He separates the evil from the good; nor is God going to make you acquainted with the unseen, but God chooses of His messengers whom He pleases; therefore believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard (against evil), then you shall have a great reward.

003.180 Y: And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which God Hath given them of His Grace, think that it is good for them: Nay, it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar, on the Day of Judgment. To God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. P: And let not those who hoard up that which God hath bestowed upon them of His bounty think that it is better for them. Nay, it is worse for them. That which they hoard will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection. God's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and God is Informed of what ye do. S: And let not those deem, who are niggardly in giving away that which God has granted them out of His grace, that it is good for them; nay, it is worse for them; they shall have that whereof they were niggardly made to cleave to their necks on the resurrection day; and God's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and God is aware of what you do.

003.181 Y: God hath heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly, God is indigent and we are rich!"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: "Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire!" P: Verily God heard the saying of those who said, (when asked for contributions to the war): "God, forsooth, is poor, and we are rich!" We shall record their saying with their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and We shall say: Taste ye the punishment of burning! S: God has certainly heard the saying of those who said: Surely God is poor and we are rich. I will record what they say, and their killing the prophets unjustly, and I will say: Taste the chastisement of burning.

003.182 Y: "This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For God never harms those who serve Him." P: This is on account of that which your own hands have sent before (you to the judgment). God is no oppressor of (His) bondmen. S: This is for what your own hands have sent before and because God is not in the least unjust to the servants.

003.183 Y: They (also) said: "God took our promise not to believe in any messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth?" P: (The same are) those who say: Lo! God hath charged us that we believe not in any messenger until he bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Messengers came unto you before me with miracles, and with that (very miracle) which ye describe. Why then did ye slay them? (Answer that) if ye are truthful! S: (Those are they) who said: Surely God has enjoined us that we should not believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering which the fire consumes. Say: Indeed, there came to you messengers before me with clear arguments and with that which you demand; why then did you kill them if you are truthful?

003.184 Y: Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment. P: And if they deny thee, even so did they deny messengers who were before thee, who came with miracles and with the Psalms and with the Scripture giving light. S: But if they reject you, so indeed were rejected before you messengers who came with clear arguments and scriptures and the illuminating book.

003.185 Y: Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception. P: Every soul will taste of death. And ye will be paid on the Day of Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned. Whoso is removed from the Fire and is made to enter paradise, he indeed is triumphant. The life of this world is but comfort of illusion. S: Every soul shall taste of death, and you shall only be paid fully your reward on the resurrection day; then whoever is removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden he indeed has attained the object; and the life of this world is nothing but a provision of vanities.

003.186 Y: Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs. P: Assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons, and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and from the idolaters. But if ye persevere and ward off (evil), then that is of the steadfast heart of things. S: You shall certainly be tried respecting your wealth and your souls, and you shall certainly hear from those who have been given the Book before you and from those who are polytheists much annoying talk; and if you are patient and guard (against evil), surely this is one of the affairs (which should be) determined upon.

003.187 Y: And remember God took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made! P: And (remember) when God laid a charge on those who had received the Scripture (He said): Ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it. But they flung it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain. Verily evil is that which they have gained thereby. S: And when God made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it; but they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so evil is that which they buy.

003.188 Y: Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think escape the penalty. For them is a penalty Grievous indeed. P: Think not that those who exult in what they have given, and love to be praised for what they have not done - Think not, they are in safety from the doom. A painful doom is theirs. S: Do not think those who rejoice for what they have done and love that they should be praised for what they have not done so do by no means think them to be safe from the chastisement, and they shall have a painful chastisement.

003.189 Y: To God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and God hath power over all things. P: Unto God belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. God is Able to do all things. S: And God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and God has power over all things.

003.190 Y: Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day,- there are indeed Signs for men of understanding,- P: Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth and (in) the difference of night and day are tokens (of His Sovereignty) for men of understanding, S: Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day there are signs for men who understand.

003.191 Y: Men who celebrate the praises of God, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth, (With the thought): "Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire." P: Such as remember God, standing, sitting, and reclining, and consider the creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say): Our Lord! Thou createdst not this in vain. Glory be to Thee! Preserve us from the doom of Fire. S: Those who remember God standing and sitting and lying on their sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: Our Lord! Thou hast not created this in vain! Glory be to Thee; save us then from the chastisement of the fire:

003.192 Y: "Our Lord! any whom Thou dost admit to the Fire, Truly Thou coverest with shame, and never will wrong-doers Find any helpers!" P: Our Lord! Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire: him indeed Thou hast confounded. For evil-doers there will be no helpers. S: Our Lord! surely whomsoever Thou makest enter the fire, him Thou hast indeed brought to disgrace, and there shall be no helpers for the unjust:

003.193 Y: "Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling (Us) to Faith, 'Believe ye in the Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out from us our iniquities, and take to Thyself our souls in the company of the righteous." P: Our Lord! Lo! we have heard a crier calling unto Faith: "Believe ye in your Lord!" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefore forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous. S: Our Lord! surely we have heard a preacher calling to the faith, saying: Believe in your Lord, so we did believe; Our Lord! forgive us therefore our faults, and cover o"or God loves those who put their trust (in Him). It was by the mercy of God that you were lenient with them (O Muhammad), for if you had been stern and fierce of heart, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them, ask forgiveness for them, and consult with them in the conduct of affairs. When you have decided, put your trust in God. God loves those who put their trust in Him. If God helps you, none can overcome you: If He forsakes you, who can help you after that? In God, let believers put their trust. No prophet could ever be false to his trust. If any person is false, he shall, on the Day of Judgment, restore what he misappropriated; then every soul will receive its due, and none shall be dealt with unjustly. Is the man who follows the good pleasure of God like the man who draws on himself the wrath of God, and whose abode is in Hell? A woeful refuge! They are in varying gardens in the sight of God, and God sees well all that they do. God did confer a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them the Signs of God, sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, while, before that, they had been in manifest error. What! When a single disaster smites you, although you smote your enemies with one twice as great, do you say, 'Whence is this?' Say to them: 'It is from yourselves: For God has power over all things.' What you suffered on the day the two armies met was with the leave of God, in order that He might test the believers, and the Hypocrites also. These were told: 'Come, fight in the way of God, or at least drive the foe from your city.' They said: 'Had we known how to fight, we would certainly have followed you.' They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but God has full knowledge of all they conceal. They are the ones that say, of their brethren slain, while they themselves sit at ease: 'If only they had listened to us, they would not have been slain.' Say: 'Avert death from your own selves, if you speak the truth.' Think not of those who are slain in God's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord; they rejoice in the bounty provided by God. And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them, the Martyrs glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they cause to grieve. They glory in the Grace and the bounty from God, and in the fact that God does not let the reward of the Faithful be lost. Of those who answered the call of God and the Messenger, even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward. Men said to them: 'A great army is gathering against you,' and frightened them, but it only increased their Faith. They said: 'For us God suffices, and He is the best disposer of affairs.' And they returned with Grace and bounty from God: no harm ever touched them, for they followed the good pleasure of God. And God is the Lord of bounties unbounded. It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be not afraid of them, but fear Me, if you have Faith. Let not those grieve you who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to God. God's plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment. Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith will have a grievous punishment. Let not the Unbelievers think that our res""ur evil deeds and make us die with the righteous. 003.194 Y: \"Our Lord! Grant us what Thou didst promise unto us through Thine messengers, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment: For Thou never breakest Thy promise.\" P: Our Lord! And give us that which Thou hast promised to us by Thy messengers. Confound us not upon the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Thou breakest not the tryst. S: Our Lord! and grant us what Thou hast promised us by Thy messengers; and disgrace us not on the day of resurrection; surely Thou dost not fail to perform the promise. 003.195 Y: And their Lord hath accepted of them, and answered them: \"Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: Ye are members, one of another: Those who have left their homes, or been driven out therefrom, or suffered harm in My Cause, or fought or been slain,- verily, I will blot out from them their iniquities, and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath;- A reward from the presence of God, and from His presence is the best of rewards.\" P: And their Lord hath heard them (and He saith): Lo! I suffer not the work of any worker, male or female, to be lost. Ye proceed one from another. So those who fled and were driven forth from their homes and suffered damage for My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I shall remit their evil deeds from them and verily I shall bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow - A reward from God. And with God is the fairest of rewards. S: So their Lord accepted their prayer: That I will not waste the work of a worker among you, whether male or female, the one of you being from the other; they, therefore, who fled and were turned out of their homes and persecuted in My way and who fought and were slain, I will most certainly cover their evil deeds, and I will most certainly make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from God, and with God is yet better reward. 003.196 Y: Let not the strutting about of the Unbelievers through the land deceive thee: P: Let not the vicissitude (of the success) of those who disbelieve, in the land, deceive thee (O Muhammad). S: Let it not deceive you that those who disbelieve go to and fro in the cities fearlessly. 003.197 Y: Little is it for enjoyment: Their ultimate abode is Hell: what an evil bed (To lie on)! P: It is but a brief comfort. And afterward their habitation will be hell, an ill abode. S: A brief enjoyment! then their abode is hell, and evil is the resting-place. 003.198 Y: On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever),- a gift from the presence of God; and that which is in the presence of God is the best (bliss) for the righteous. P: But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be safe for ever. A gift of welcome from their Lord. That which God hath in store is better for the righteous. S: But as to those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding in them; an entertainment from their Lord, and that which is with God is best for the righteous. 003.199 Y: And there are, certainly, among the People of the Book, those who believe in God, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them, bowing in humility to God: They will not sell the Signs of God for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord, and God is swift in account. P: And lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in God and that which is revealed unto you and that which was revealed unto them, humbling themselves before God. They purchase not a trifling gain at the price of the revelations of God. Verily their reward is with their Lord. Lo! God is swift to take account. S: And most surely of the followers of the Book there are those who believe in God and (in) that which has been revealed to you and (in) that which has been revealed to them, being lowly before God; they do not take a small price for the communications of God; these it is that have their reward with their Lord; surely God is quick in reckoning. 003.200 Y: O ye who believe! Persevere in patience and constancy; vie in such perseverance; strengthen each other; and fear God; that ye may prosper. P: O ye who believe! Endure, outdo all others in endurance, be ready, and observe your duty to God, in order that ye may succeed. S: O you who believe! be patient and excel in patience and remain steadfast, and be careful of (your duty to) God, that you may be successful. - Chapter 4: AN-NISA (WOMEN)Total Verses: 176 Revealed At: MADINA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 004.001 Y: O mankind! reverence your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a single person, created, of like nature, His mate, and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women;- reverence God, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights), and (reverence) the wombs (That bore you): for God ever watches over you. P: O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a multitude of men and women. Be careful of your duty toward God in Whom ye claim (your rights) of one another, and toward the wombs (that bare you). Lo! God hath been a watcher over you. S: O people! be careful of (your duty to) your Lord, Who created you from a single being and created its mate of the same (kind) and spread from these two, many men and women; and be careful of (your duty to) God, by Whom you demand one of another (your rights), and (to) the ties of relationship; surely God ever watches over you. 004.002 Y: To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age), nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your won. For this is indeed a great sin. P: Give unto orphans their wealth. Exchange not the good for the bad (in your management thereof) nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth. Lo! that would be a great sin. S: And give to the orphans their property, and do not substitute worthless (things) for (their) good (ones), and do not devour their property (as an addition) to your own property; this is surely a great crime. 004.003 Y: If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice. P: And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the women, who seem good to you, two or three or four; and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice (to so many) then one (only) or (the captives) that your right hands possess. Thus it is more likely that ye will not do injustice. S: And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans, then marry such women as seem good to you, two and three and four; but if you fear that you will not do justice (between them), then (marry) only one or what your right hands possess; this is more proper, that you may not deviate from the right course. 004.004 Y: And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer. P: And give unto the women (whom ye marry) free gift of their marriage portions; but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof, then ye are welcome to absorb it (in your wealth). S: And give women their dowries as a free gift, but if they of themselves be pleased to give up to you a portion of it, then eat it with enjoyment and with wholesome result. 004.005Y: To those weak of understanding Make not over your property, whichGod hath made a means of support for you, but feed and clothe themtherewith, and speak to them words of kindness and justice. P: Give not unto the foolish (what is in) your (keeping of their) wealth, which God hath given you to maintain; but feed and clothe them from it, and speak kindly unto them. S: And do not give away your property which God has made for you a (means of) support to the weak of understanding, and maintain them out of (the profits of) it, and clothe them and speak to them words of honest advice. 004.006 Y: Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, Let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is God in taking account. P: Prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age; then, if ye find them of sound judgment, deliver over unto them their fortune; and devour it not by squandering and in haste lest they should grow up Whoso (of the guardians) is rich, let him abstain generously (from taking of the property of orphans); and whoso is poor let him take thereof in reason (for his guardianship). And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans, have (the transaction) witnessed in their presence. God sufficeth as a Reckoner. S: And test the orphans until they attain puberty; then if you find in them maturity of intellect, make over to them their property, and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they attain to full age; and whoever is rich, let him abstain altogether, and whoever is poor, let him eat reasonably; then when you make over to them their property, call witnesses in their presence; and God is enough as a Reckoner. 004.007 Y: From what is left by parents and those nearest related there is a share for men and a share for women, whether the property be small or large,-a determinate share. P: Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, whether it be little or much - a legal share. S: Men shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave, and women shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave, whether there is little or much of it; a stated portion. 004.008 Y: But if at the time of division other relatives, or orphans or poor, are present, feed them out of the (property), and speak to them words of kindness and justice. P: And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at the division (of the heritage), bestow on them therefrom and speak kindly unto them. S: And when there are present at the division the relatives and the orphans and the needy, give them (something) out of it and speak to them kind words. 004""pite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment. And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodes good unto their souls. We only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness. And theirs will be a shameful doom. And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for their souls; We grant them respite only that they may add to their sins; and they shall have a disgraceful chastisement.

God will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers whom He pleases. So believe in God and His messengers: And if you believe and do right, you have a reward without measure. It is not the purpose of God to leave you in your present state till He shall separate the wicked from the good. And it is not the purpose of God to let you know the Unseen. But God chooses of His messengers whom He will, to receive knowledge thereof. So believe in God and His messengers. If you believe and ward off evil, yours will be a vast reward. On no account will God leave the believers in the condition which you are in until He separates the evil from the good; nor is God going to make you acquainted with the unseen, but God chooses of His messengers whom He pleases; therefore believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard against evil, then you shall have a great reward.

And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which God has given them of His Grace, think that it is good for them: Nay, it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks like a twisted collar, on the Day of Judgment. To God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and God is well-acquainted with all that you do. And let not those who hoard up that which God has bestowed upon them of His bounty think that it is better for them. Nay, it is worse for them. That which they hoard will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection. God's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and God is informed of what you do. And let not those deem, who are niggardly in giving away that which God has granted them out of His grace, that it is good for them; nay, it is worse for them; they shall have that whereof they were niggardly made to cleave to their necks on the resurrection day; and God's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and God is aware of what you do.

God has heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly, God is indigent and we are rich!" We shall certainly record their word and their act of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: "Taste the penalty of the Scorching Fire!" Verily God heard the saying of those who said, when asked for contributions to the war: "God, forsooth, is poor, and we are rich!" We shall record their saying with their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and We shall say: Taste the punishment of burning! God has certainly heard the saying of those who said: Surely God is poor and we are rich. I will record what they say, and their killing the prophets unjustly, and I will say: Taste the chastisement of burning.

This is because of the unrighteous deeds which your hands sent on before you: For God never harms those who serve Him. This is on account of that which your own hands have sent before you to the judgment. God is no oppressor of His bondmen. This is for what your own hands have sent before and because God is not in the least unjust to the servants.

They also said: "God took our promise not to believe in any messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire from heaven." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what you ask for: why then did you slay them, if you speak the truth?" Those who say: Lo! God has charged us that we believe not in any messenger until he brings us an offering which fire from heaven shall devour. Say unto them, O Muhammad: Messengers came unto you before me with miracles, and with that very miracle which you describe. Why then did you slay them? Answer that if you are truthful! Those who said: Surely God has enjoined us that we should not believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering which the fire consumes. Say: Indeed, there came to you messengers before me with clear arguments and with that which you demand; why then did you kill them if you are truthful?

Then if they reject you, so were rejected messengers before you, who came with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment. And if they deny you, even so did they deny messengers who were before you, who came with miracles and with the Psalms and with the Scripture giving light. But if they reject you, so indeed were rejected before you messengers who came with clear arguments and scriptures and the illuminating book.

Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object of Life: For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception. Every soul will taste of death. And you will be paid on the Day of Resurrection only that which you have fairly earned. Whoso is removed from the Fire and is made to enter paradise, he indeed is triumphant. The life of this world is but comfort of illusion. Every soul shall taste of death, and you shall only be paid fully your reward on the resurrection day; then whoever is removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden he indeed has attained the object; and the life of this world is nothing but a provision of vanities.

You shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if you persevere patiently, and guard against evil, then that will be a determining factor in all affairs. Assuredly you will be tried in your property and in your persons, and you will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and from the idolaters. But if you persevere and ward off evil, then that is of the steadfast heart of things. You shall certainly be tried respecting your wealth and your souls, and you shall certainly hear from those who have been given the Book before you and from those who are polytheists much annoying talk; and if you are patient and guard against evil, surely this is one of the affairs which should be determined upon.

And remember God took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made! And remember when God laid a charge on those who had received the Scripture: You are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it. But they flung it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain. Verily evil is that which they have gained thereby. And when God made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it; but they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so evil is that which they buy.

Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and love to be praised for what they have not done, think they escape the penalty. For them is a penalty Grievous indeed. Think not that those who exult in what they have given, and love to be praised for what they have not done - Think not, they are in safety from the doom. A painful doom is theirs. Do not think those who rejoice for what they have done and love that they should be praised for what they have not done so do by no means think them to be safe from the chastisement, and they shall have a painful chastisement.

To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and God has power over all things. Unto God belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. God is Able to do all things. And God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and God has power over all things.

Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, there are indeed Signs for men of understanding. Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the difference of night and day are tokens of His Sovereignty for men of understanding. Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day there are signs for men who understand.

Men who celebrate the praises of God, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the wonders of creation in the heavens and the earth, with the thought: "Our Lord! not for naught have You created all this! Glory to You! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire." Such as remember God, standing, sitting, and reclining, and consider the creation of the heavens and the earth, and say: Our Lord! You created not this in vain. Glory be to You! Preserve us from the doom of Fire. Those who remember God standing and sitting and lying on their sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: Our Lord! You have not created this in vain! Glory be to You; save us then from the chastisement of the fire.

"Our Lord! any whom You admit to the Fire, Truly You cover with shame, and never will wrong-doers find any helpers!" Our Lord! Whom You cause to enter the Fire: him indeed You have confounded. For evil-doers there will be no helpers. Our Lord! surely whomsoever You make enter the fire, him You have indeed brought to disgrace, and there shall be no helpers for the unjust.

"Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling us to Faith, 'Believe in the Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out from us our iniquities, and take to Yourself our souls in the company of the righteous." Our Lord! Lo! we have heard a crier calling unto Faith: "Believe in your Lord!" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefore forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous. Our Lord! surely we have heard a preacher calling to the faith, saying: Believe in your Lord, so we did believe; Our Lord! forgive us therefore our faults, and cover our sins.".009 Let those disposing of an estate have the same fear in their minds as they would for their own if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear God, and speak words of appropriate comfort. Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, eat up a Fire into their own bodies: They will soon be enduring a Blazing Fire! God directs you as regards your children's inheritance: to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the only heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or sisters the mother has a sixth. The distribution in all cases is after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by God; and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. In what ye leave, their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child, they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused to anyone. Thus is it ordained by God; and God is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. Those are limits set by God: those who obey God and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein forever and that will be the supreme achievement. But those who disobey God and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment. If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four reliable witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death claims them, or God ordains for them some other way. If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone; for God is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. God accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will God turn in mercy: For God is full of knowledge and wisdom. Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until death faces one of them, and he says, 'Now have I repented indeed;' nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous. O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may take away part of the dower ye have given them, except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good. But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another, even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it back: Would ye take it by slander and manifest wrong?"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because God has given the one more strength than the other and because they support them from their means. Therefore, righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husband's absence what God would have them guard. As to those women on whose part you fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them first, next refuse to share their beds, and lastly beat them lightly; but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means of annoyance: For God is Most High, Great above you all."Our Lord! Grant us what You promised through Your messengers, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment. You never break Your promise." Their Lord accepted and answered them: "I will not let the work of any of you be lost, whether male or female. You are members, one of another. Those who left their homes, were driven out, suffered harm in My cause, fought, or were slain, I will blot out their iniquities and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. A reward from God, and His presence is the best of rewards."

"Let not the strutting of the unbelievers through the land deceive you. It is but a brief comfort. Their ultimate abode is Hell, an evil resting place. But those who fear their Lord will have Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, where they will dwell forever. A gift from God, and what is with God is best for the righteous."

Among the People of the Book, there are those who believe in God, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them, humbling themselves before God. They do not sell the Signs of God for a miserable gain. For them is a reward with their Lord, and God is swift in account.

O you who believe! Persevere in patience and constancy; vie in such perseverance; strengthen each other; and fear God, that you may prosper.

Chapter 4: AN-NISA (WOMEN)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

O mankind! Reverence your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a single person, created its mate, and from them scattered countless men and women. Reverence God, through whom you demand your mutual rights, and the wombs that bore you. God ever watches over you.

To orphans, restore their property when they reach their age. Do not substitute worthless things for their good ones, nor devour their substance by mixing it with your own. This is indeed a great sin.

If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two or three or four. But if you fear that you cannot do justice, then marry only one or what your right hands possess. This will prevent you from doing injustice.

Give women their dower as a free gift, but if they remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.

Do not give your property, which God has made a means of support for you, to those weak of understanding. Feed and clothe them with it and speak to them words of kindness and justice.

Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage. If you find sound judgment in them, release their property to them. Do not consume it wastefully or in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have what is just and reasonable. When you release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence. God is sufficient in taking account.

From what is left by parents and those nearest related, there is a share for men and a share for women, whether the property is small or large—a determinate share.

If at the time of division other relatives, or orphans, or poor are present, feed them out of the property and speak to them words of kindness and justice.Let those who manage an estate have the same concern as they would for their own family if they left behind a helpless family. Let them fear God and speak words of comfort. Those who unjustly consume the property of orphans are consuming fire into their own bodies and will endure a blazing fire.

God directs you regarding your children's inheritance: to the male, a portion equal to that of two females. If only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share each if the deceased left children; if no children, the mother has a third; if the deceased left siblings, the mother has a sixth. These are settled portions ordained by God, who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

In what your wives leave, your share is a half if they leave no child; if they leave a child, you get a fourth. In what you leave, their share is a fourth if you leave no child; if you leave a child, they get an eighth. If the deceased has left neither ascendants nor descendants but has left a brother or a sister, each gets a sixth; if more than two, they share a third. This is ordained by God, who is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.

Those who obey God and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein forever. Those who disobey God and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein, and they shall have a humiliating punishment.

If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four reliable witnesses against them. If they testify, confine them to houses until death claims them or God ordains another way. If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone; for God is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

God accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterward. The repentance of those who continue to do evil until death faces them is of no effect. For those who die rejecting faith, a grievous punishment is prepared.

O believers, you are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Do not treat them harshly to take away part of the dower you have given them, except where they have been guilty of open lewdness. Live with them in kindness and equity. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike something in which God has placed much good.

If you decide to take one wife in place of another, even if you had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, do not take the least bit of it back. Would you take it by slander and manifest wrong?"are the obedient, guarding in secret that which God hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! God is ever High, Exalted, Great. Men are the maintainers of women because God has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as God has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely God is High, Great. If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, God will cause their reconciliation: For God hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things. And if ye fear a breach between them twain (the man and wife), appoint an arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they desire amendment God will make them of one mind. Lo! God is ever Knower, Aware. And if you fear a breach between the two, then appoint judge from his people and a judge from her people; if they both desire agreement, God will effect harmony between them, surely God is Knowing, Aware. Serve God, and join not any partners with Him; and do good- to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbours who are near, neighbours who are strangers, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (ye meet), and what your right hands possess: For God loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious; And serve God. Ascribe no thing as partner unto Him. (Show) kindness unto parents, and unto near kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and unto the neighbour who is of kin (unto you) and the neighbour who is not of kin, and the fellow-traveller and the wayfarer and (the slaves) whom your right hands possess. Lo! God loveth not such as are proud and boastful, And serve God and do not associate any thing with Him and be good to the parents and to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the neighbor of (your) kin and the alien neighbor, and the companion in a journey and the wayfarer and those whom your right hands possess; surely God does not love him who is proud, boastful; (Nor) those who are niggardly or enjoin niggardliness on others, or hide the bounties which God hath bestowed on them; for We have prepared, for those who resist Faith, a punishment that steeps them in contempt; Who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others, and hide that which God hath bestowed upon them of His bounty. For disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom; Those who are niggardly and bid people to be niggardly and hide what God has given them out of His grace; and We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement. Not those who spend of their substance, to be seen of men, but have no faith in God and the Last Day: If any take the Evil One for their intimate, what a dreadful intimate he is! And (also) those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men, and believe not in God nor the Last Day. Whoso taketh Satan for a comrade, a bad comrade hath he. And those who spend their property (in alms) to be seen of the people and do not believe in God nor in the last day; and as for him whose associate is the Shaitan, an evil associate is he! And what burden Were it on them if they had faith in God and in the Last Day, and they spent out of what God hath given them for sustenance? For God hath full knowledge of them. What have they (to fear) if they believe in God and the Last Day and spend (aright) of that which God hath bestowed upon them, when God is ever Aware of them (and all they do)? And what (harm) would it have done them if they had believed in God and the last day and spent (benevolently) of what God had given them? And God knows them. God is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His own presence a great reward. Lo! God wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant; and if there is a good deed, He will double it and will give (the doer) from His presence an immense reward. Surely God does not do injustice to the weight of an atom, and if it is a good deed He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward. How then if We brought from each people a witness, and We brought thee as a witness against these people! But how (will it be with them) when We bring of every people a witness, and We bring thee (O Muhammad) a witness against these? How will it be, then, when We bring from every people a witness and bring you as a witness against these? On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish that the earth Were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact from God! On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they were level with the ground, and they can hide no fact from God. On that day will those who disbelieve and disobey the Messenger desire that the earth were levelled with them, and they shall not hide any word from God. O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road), until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For God doth blot out sins and forgive again and again. O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the road, till ye have bathed. And if ye be ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women, and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands (therewith). Lo! God is Benign, Forgiving. O you who believe! do not go near prayer when you are Intoxicated until you know (well) what you say, nor when you are under an obligation to perform a bath unless (you are) travelling on the road until you have washed yourselves; and if you are sick, or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy or you have touched the women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth, then wipe your faces and your hands; surely God is Pardoning, Forgiving. Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? they traffic in error, and wish that ye should lose the right path. Seest thou not those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given, how they purchase error, and seek to make you (Muslims) err from the right way? Have you not considered those to whom a portion of the Book has been given? They buy error and desire that you should go astray from the way. But God hath full knowledge of your enemies: God is enough for a protector, and God is enough for a Helper. God knoweth best (who are) your enemies. God is sufficient as a Guardian, and God is sufficient as a Supporter. And God best knows your enemies; and God suffices as a Guardian, and God suffices as a Helper. Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: "We hear and we disobey"; and "Hear what is not Heard"; and "Ra'ina"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: "We hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but God hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe. Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: "We hear and disobey; hear thou as one who heareth not" and "Listen to us!" distorting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: "We hear and we obey: hear thou, and look at us" it had been better for them, and more upright. But God hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few. Of those who are Jews (there are those who) alter words from their places and say: We have heard and we disobey and: Hear, may you not be made to hear! and: Raina, distorting (the word) with their tongues and taunting about religion; and if they had said (instead): We have heard and we obey, and hearken, and unzurna it would have been better for them and more upright; but God has cursed them on account of their unbelief, so they do not believe but a little. O ye People of the Book! believe in what We have (now) revealed, confirming what was (already) with you, before We change the face and fame of some (of you) beyond all recognition, and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers, for the decision of God must be carried out. O ye unto whom the Scripture hath been given! Believe in what We have revealed confirming that which ye possess, before We destroy countenances so as to confound them, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers (of old time). The commandment of God is always executed. O you who have been given the Book! believe that which We have revealed, verifying what you have, before We alter faces then turn them on their backs, or curse them as We cursed the violaters of the Sabbath, and the command of God shall be executed. God forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with God is to devise a sin most heinous indeed. Lo! God forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him. He forgiveth (all) save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners to God, he hath indeed invented a tremendous sin. Surely God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever associates anything with God, he devises indeed a great sin. Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who claim sanctity for themselves? Nay-but God Doth sanctify whom He pleaseth. But never will they fail to receive justice in the least little thing. Hast thou not seen those who praise themselves for purity? Nay, God purifieth whom He will, and they will not be wronged even the hair upon a date-stone. Have you not considered those who attribute purity to themselves? Nay, God purifies whom He pleases; and they shall not be wronged the husk of a date stone. Behold! how they invent a lie against God! but that by itself is a manifest sin! See, how they invent lies about God! That of itself is flagrant""Even if you have given one of them a heap of gold, do not take anything back; would you take it by slandering her and committing manifest wrong? How could you take it when you have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a solemn covenant? And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what is past: it was shameful and odious, an abominable custom indeed. Forbidden to you (for marriage) are your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (who gave you suck), foster-sisters; your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in—no prohibition if you have not gone in; (those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Also prohibited are women already married, except those whom your right hands possess: thus hath God ordained prohibitions against you. Except for these, all others are lawful, provided you seek them in marriage with gifts from your property, desiring chastity, not lust. Seeing that you derive benefit from them, give them their dowers as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, you mutually agree to vary it, there is no blame on you, and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. If any of you have not the means to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess: and God has full knowledge about your faith. You are one from another: wed them with the leave of their owners, and give them their dowers according to what is reasonable: they should be chaste, not lustful, nor taking paramours. When they are taken in wedlock, if they fall into shame, their punishment is half that for free women. This permission is for those among you who fear sin; but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint. And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. God wishes to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and He wishes to turn to you in mercy: and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. God wishes to turn to you, but those who follow their lusts wish that you should turn away from Him, far, far away. God wishes to lighten your difficulties: for man was created weak. O you who believe! Do not devour your property among yourselves falsely, except that it be trading by mutual consent; and do not kill yourselves; surely God is Merciful to you. If any do that in rancor and injustice, soon shall We cast them into the Fire: and easy it is for God. If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden, We will expel out of you all the evil in you, and admit you to a gate of great honor. And do not covet that by which God has made some of you excel others; men shall have the benefit of what they earn and women shall have the benefit of what they earn; and ask God of His grace; surely God knows all things. To everyone, We have appointed heirs to property left by parents and relatives. To those, also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give their due portion. For truly God is witness to all things. Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because God has given the one more strength than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore, righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husband's absence what God would have them guard. As to those women on whose part you fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them first, next refuse to share their beds, and last beat them lightly; but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means of annoyance: for God is Most High, great above you all."sin. See how they forge the lie against God, and this is sufficient as a manifest sin. Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? They believe in sorcery and evil, and say to the unbelievers that they are better guided in the right way than the believers! They are men whom God hath cursed: And those whom God hath cursed, thou wilt find, have no one to help. Have they a share in dominion or power? Behold, they give not a farthing to their fellow-men. Or do they envy mankind for what God hath given them of His bounty? But We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom. Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him: And enough is Hell for a burning fire. Those who reject our signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty: for God is Exalted in Power, Wise. But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall soon admit to Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath, their eternal home: Therein shall they have companions pure and holy: We shall admit them to shades, cool and ever deepening. God doth command you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between man and man, that ye judge with justice: Verily how excellent is the teaching which He giveth you! For God is He Who heareth and seeth all things. O ye who believe! Obey God, and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to God and His Messenger, if ye do believe in God and the Last Day: That is best, and most suitable for final determination. Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? Their real wish is to resort together for judgment in their disputes to the Evil One, though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan's wish is to lead them astray far away from the right. When it is said to them: "Come to what God hath revealed, and to the Messenger": Thou seest the hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust. How then, when they are seized by misfortune, because of the deeds which their hands have sent forth? Then they come to thee, swearing by God: "We meant no more than good-will and conciliation!" Those men, God knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them, but admonish them, and speak to them a word to reach their very souls. We sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will of God. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee and asked God's forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found God indeed Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. But no, by the Lord, they can have no real faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction. If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were actually told, it would have been best for them, and would have gone farthest to strengthen their faith; And We should then have given them from our presence a great reward; And We should have shown them the Straight Way. All who obey God and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of God, of the prophets who teach, the sincere lovers of truth, the witnesses who testify, and the righteous who do good: Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!"God and the Messenger, these are with those upon whom God has bestowed favors from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the good, and a goodly company are they! Such is the bounty from God: And sufficient is it that God knoweth all. O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties or go forth all together. There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you, they say: 'God did favor us in that we were not present among them.' But if good fortune comes to you from God, they would be sure to say - as if there had never been ties of affection between you and them - 'Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!' Let those fight in the cause of God who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fights in the cause of God, whether he is slain or gets victory, soon shall We give him a reward of great value. And why should ye not fight in the cause of God and of those who, being weak, are ill-treated and oppressed? Men, women, and children, whose cry is: 'Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from Thee one who will protect; and raise for us from Thee one who will help!' Those who believe fight in the cause of God, and those who reject faith fight in the cause of evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan. Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands from fight but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity? When the order for fighting was issued to them, behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared God: They said: 'Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not grant us respite to our natural term, near enough?' Say: 'Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!' Wherever ye are, death will find you out, even if ye are in towers built up strong and high! If some good befalls them, they say, 'This is from God'; but if evil, they say, 'This is from thee.' Say: 'All things are from God.' But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact? Whatever good happens to thee, is from God; but whatever evil happens to thee, is from thy own soul. And We have sent thee as a messenger to instruct mankind. And enough is God for a witness. He who obeys the Messenger, obeys God: But if any turn away, We have not sent thee to watch over their evil deeds. They have 'Obedience' on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section of them meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But God records their nightly plots: So keep clear of them, and put thy trust in God, and enough is God as a disposer of affairs. Do they not consider the Qur'an with care? Had it been from other than God, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy. When there comes to them some matter touching public safety or fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger, or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have tested it from them directly. Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of God unto you, all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan. Then fight in God's cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers. It may be that God will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for God is the strongest in might and in punishment. Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein: And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause, shares in its burden: And God hath power over all things."Whoso interveneth in a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whoso interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof. God overseeth all things. When a courteous greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or at least of equal courtesy. God takes careful account of all things. God! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than God's? Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? God hath upset them for their evil deeds. Would ye guide those whom God hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom God hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way. They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing as they. But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of God. But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty of peace, or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If God had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and instead send you guarantees of peace, then God hath opened no way for you to war against them. Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people. Every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto. If they withdraw not from you nor give you guarantees of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them. In their case, We have provided you with a clear argument against them. Never should a believer kill a believer; but if it so happens by mistake, compensation is due. If one kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave and pay compensation to the deceased's family, unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave is enough. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, a fast for two months running is prescribed by way of repentance to God. For God hath all knowledge and all wisdom. If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein forever. And the wrath and the curse of God are upon him, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him. O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of God, investigate carefully, and say not to anyone who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none of a believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with God are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till God conferred on you His favors. Therefore carefully investigate. For God is well aware of all that ye do. Not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home. Unto all in Faith hath God promised good. But those who strive and fight hath He distinguished above those who sit at home by a special reward. Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: "In what plight were ye?" They reply: "Weak and oppressed were we in the earth.""are the obedient, guarding in secret that which God hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! God is ever High, Exalted, Great. Men are the maintainers of women because God has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as God has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely God is High, Great. If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, God will cause their reconciliation: For God hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things. And if ye fear a breach between them twain (the man and wife), appoint an arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they desire amendment God will make them of one mind. Lo! God is ever Knower, Aware. And if you fear a breach between the two, then appoint judge from his people and a judge from her people; if they both desire agreement, God will effect harmony between them, surely God is Knowing, Aware. Serve God, and join not any partners with Him; and do good- to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbours who are near, neighbours who are strangers, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (ye meet), and what your right hands possess: For God loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious; And serve God. Ascribe no thing as partner unto Him. (Show) kindness unto parents, and unto near kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and unto the neighbour who is of kin (unto you) and the neighbour who is not of kin, and the fellow-traveller and the wayfarer and (the slaves) whom your right hands possess. Lo! God loveth not such as are proud and boastful, And serve God and do not associate any thing with Him and be good to the parents and to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the neighbor of (your) kin and the alien neighbor, and the companion in a journey and the wayfarer and those whom your right hands possess; surely God does not love him who is proud, boastful; (Nor) those who are niggardly or enjoin niggardliness on others, or hide the bounties which God hath bestowed on them; for We have prepared, for those who resist Faith, a punishment that steeps them in contempt; Who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others, and hide that which God hath bestowed upon them of His bounty. For disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom; Those who are niggardly and bid people to be niggardly and hide what God has given them out of His grace; and We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement. Not those who spend of their substance, to be seen of men, but have no faith in God and the Last Day: If any take the Evil One for their intimate, what a dreadful intimate he is! And (also) those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men, and believe not in God nor the Last Day. Whoso taketh Satan for a comrade, a bad comrade hath he. And those who spend their property (in alms) to be seen of the people and do not believe in God nor in the last day; and as for him whose associate is the Shaitan, an evil associate is he! And what burden Were it on them if they had faith in God and in the Last Day, and they spent out of what God hath given them for sustenance? For God hath full knowledge of them. What have they (to fear) if they believe in God and the Last Day and spend (aright) of that which God hath bestowed upon them, when God is ever Aware of them (and all they do)? And what (harm) would it have done them if they had believed in God and the last day and spent (benevolently) of what God had given them? And God knows them. God is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His own presence a great reward. Lo! God wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant; and if there is a good deed, He will double it and will give (the doer) from His presence an immense reward. Surely God does not do injustice to the weight of an atom, and if it is a good deed He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward. How then if We brought from each people a witness, and We brought thee as a witness against these people! But how (will it be with them) when We bring of every people a witness, and We bring thee (O Muhammad) a witness against these? How will it be, then, when We bring from every people a witness and bring you as a witness against these? On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish that the earth Were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact from God! On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they were level with the ground, and they can hide no fact from God. On that day will those who disbelieve and disobey the Messenger desire that the earth were levelled with them, and they shall not hide any word from God. O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road), until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For God doth blot out sins and forgive again and again. O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the road, till ye have bathed. And if ye be ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women, and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands (therewith). Lo! God is Benign, Forgiving. O you who believe! do not go near prayer when you are Intoxicated until you know (well) what you say, nor when you are under an obligation to perform a bath unless (you are) travelling on the road until you have washed yourselves; and if you are sick, or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy or you have touched the women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth, then wipe your faces and your hands; surely God is Pardoning, Forgiving.

But God hath full knowledge of your enemies: God is enough for a protector, and God is enough for a Helper. God knoweth best (who are) your enemies.

If only they had said: "We hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but God hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.

Of those who are Jews (there are those who) alter words from their places and say: We have heard and we disobey and: Hear, may you not be made to hear! and: Raina, distorting (the word) with their tongues and taunting about religion; and if they had said (instead): We have heard and we obey, and hearken, and unzurna it would have been better for them and more upright; but God has cursed them on account of their unbelief, so they do not believe but a little.

Behold! how they invent a lie against God! but that by itself is a manifest sin! See, how they invent lies about God! That of itself is flagrant""Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to move yourselves away from evil?" Such men will find their abode in Hell, an evil refuge. Those whom the angels take in death while they wrong themselves will be asked: "In what were you engaged?" They will say: "We were oppressed in the land." The angels will say: "Was not God's earth spacious that you could have migrated therein?" Their habitation will be Hell, an evil journey's end. Except those who are weak and oppressed - men, women, and children - who have no means in their power, nor a guide-post to their way. For these, there is hope that God will forgive: For God blots out sins and forgives again and again. He who forsakes his home in the cause of God finds in the earth many a refuge, wide and spacious. Should he die as a refugee from home for God and His Messenger, his reward becomes due and sure with God: And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the Unbelievers may attack you: For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you are among them and arrange their worship, let one party stand up in prayer with you, taking their arms with them. When they finish their prostrations, let them take their position in the rear. Let the other party come up which has not yet prayed and let them pray with you, taking all precaution and bearing arms. The Unbelievers wish, if you were negligent of your arms and baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take every precaution for yourselves. For the Unbelievers God has prepared a humiliating punishment. When you have performed the act of worship, remember God, standing, sitting, and reclining. When you are in safety, observe proper worship. Worship at fixed times has been enjoined on the believers. Do not slacken in following up the enemy: If you are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but you have hope from God, while they have none. God is full of knowledge and wisdom. We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men as guided by God: so be not used as an advocate by those who betray their trust. Seek the forgiveness of God; for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Contend not on behalf of such as betray their own souls; for God loves not one given to perfidy and crime. They may hide their crimes from men, but they cannot hide them from God, seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night, in words that He cannot approve. God encompasses all that they do. These are the sort of men on whose behalf you may contend in this world; but who will contend with God on their behalf on the Day of Judgment, or who will carry their affairs through? If anyone does evil or wrongs his own soul but afterwards seeks God's forgiveness, he will find God Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. If anyone earns sin, he earns it against his own soul: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom. If anyone earns a fault or a sin and throws it onto one that is innocent, he carries both a falsehood and a flagrant sin. But for the Grace of God to you and His Mercy, a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead you astray. But in fact, they will only lead their own souls astray, and to you, they can do no harm in the least. For God has sent down to you the Book and wisdom and taught you what you knew not before: And great is the Grace of God unto you. In most of their secret talks, there is no good: But if one exhorts to a deed of charity or justice or conciliation between men, secrecy is permissible. To him who does this, seeking the good pleasure of God, We shall soon give a reward of the highest value."Much of their secret conferences save (in) him who enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace-making among the people. Whoso doeth that, seeking the good pleasure of God, We shall bestow on him a vast reward. If anyone contends with the Messenger even after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that becoming to men of Faith, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen, and land him in Hell, an evil refuge! God forgiveth not the sin of joining other gods with Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins than this: one who joins other gods with God has strayed far away from the right. They invoke in His stead only females; they pray to none else than Satan, a rebel. God cursed him, but he said: 'I will take of Thy servants a portion marked off; I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and to deface the fair nature created by God.' Whoever, forsaking God, takes Satan for a friend, has suffered a manifest loss. Satan makes them promises, and creates in them false desires; but Satan's promises are nothing but deception. They will have their dwelling in Hell, and from it they will find no way of escape. But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall soon admit them to gardens, with rivers flowing beneath, to dwell therein forever. God's promise is the truth, and whose word can be truer than God's? Not your desires, nor those of the People of the Book can prevail: whoever works evil will be requited accordingly. Nor will he find, besides God, any protector or helper. If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them. Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to God, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For God did take Abraham for a friend. To God belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And He it is that encompasses all things. They ask thy instruction concerning the women. Say: God doth instruct you about them: And remember what hath been rehearsed unto you in the Book, concerning the orphans of women to whom ye give not the portions prescribed, and yet whom ye desire to marry, as also concerning the children who are weak and oppressed: that ye stand firm for justice to orphans. There is not a good deed which ye do, but God is well-acquainted therewith. If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men's souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practice self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is your ardent desire: But turn not away from a woman altogether, so as to leave her hanging in the air. If ye come to a friendly understanding, and practice self-restraint, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. But if they disagree and must part, God will provide abundance for all from His all-reaching bounty: for God is He that careth for all and is Wise. To God belong all things in the heavens and on earth. Verily we have directed the People of the Book before you, and you (O Muslims) to fear God. But if ye deny Him, unto God belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and God is free of all wants, worthy of all praise."sin. See how they forge the lie against God, and this is sufficient as a manifest sin. Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? They believe in sorcery and evil, and say to the unbelievers that they are better guided in the right way than the believers! Hast thou not seen those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given, how they believe in idols and false deities, and how they say of those who disbelieve: "These are more rightly guided than those who believe"? Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book has been given? They believe in idols and false deities and say of those who disbelieve: These are better guided in the path than those who believe. They are men whom God hath cursed: And those whom God hath cursed, thou wilt find, have no one to help. Those are they whom God hath cursed, and he whom God hath cursed, thou (O Muhammad) wilt find for him no helper. Those are they whom God has cursed, and whomever God curses you shall not find any helper for him. Have they a share in dominion or power? Behold, they give not a farthing to their fellow-men. Or have they even a share in the sovereignty? Then in that case, they would not give mankind even the speck on a date-stone. Or have they a share in the kingdom? But then they would not give to people even the speck in the date stone. Or do they envy mankind for what God hath given them of His bounty? But We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom. Or are they jealous of mankind because of that which God of His bounty hath bestowed upon them? For We bestowed upon the house of Abraham (of old) the Scripture and wisdom, and We bestowed on them a mighty kingdom. Or do they envy the people for what God has given them of His grace? But indeed We have given to Ibrahim's children the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them a grand kingdom. Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him: And enough is Hell for a burning fire. And of them were some who believed therein and of them were some who turned away from it. Hell is sufficient for their burning. So of them is he who believes in him, and of them is he who turns away from him, and hell is sufficient to burn. Those who reject our signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty: for God is Exalted in Power, Wise. Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. Lo! God is ever Mighty, Wise. As for those who disbelieve in Our communications, We shall make them enter fire; so oft as their skins are thoroughly burned, We will change them for other skins, that they may taste the chastisement; surely God is Mighty, Wise. But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall soon admit to Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath, their eternal home: Therein shall they have companions pure and holy: We shall admit them to shades, cool and ever deepening. And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow - to dwell therein forever; there for them are pure companions - and We shall make them enter plenteous shade. And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them forever; they shall have therein pure mates, and We shall make them enter a dense shade. God doth command you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between man and man, that ye judge with justice: Verily how excellent is the teaching which He giveth you! For God is He Who heareth and seeth all things. Lo! God commandeth you that ye restore deposits to their owners, and, if ye judge between mankind, that ye judge justly. Lo! comely is this which God admonisheth you. Lo! God is ever Hearer, Seer. Surely God commands you to make over trusts to their owners and that when you judge between people you judge with justice; surely God admonishes you with what is excellent; surely God is Seeing, Hearing. O ye who believe! Obey God, and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to God and His Messenger, if ye do believe in God and the Last Day: That is best, and most suitable for final determination. O ye who believe! Obey God, and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority; and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to God and the messenger if ye are believers in God and the Last Day. That is better and more seemly in the end. O you who believe! obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you; then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to God and the Messenger, if you believe in God and the last day; this is better and very good in the end. Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? Their real wish is to resort together for judgment in their disputes to the Evil One, though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan's wish is to lead them astray far away from the right. Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee, how they would go for judgment in their disputes to false deities when they have been ordered to abjure them? Satan would mislead them far astray. Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They desire to summon one another to the judgment of the Shaitan, though they were commanded to deny him, and the Shaitan desires to lead them astray into a remote error. When it is said to them: "Come to what God hath revealed, and to the Messenger": Thou seest the hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust. And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which God hath revealed and unto the messenger, thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion. And when it is said to them: Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger, you will see the hypocrites turning away from you with utter aversion. How then, when they are seized by misfortune, because of the deeds which their hands have sent forth? Then they come to thee, swearing by God: "We meant no more than good-will and conciliation!" How would it be if a misfortune smote them because of that which their own hands have sent before them? Then would they come unto thee, swearing by God that they were seeking naught but harmony and kindness. But how will it be when misfortune befalls them on account of what their hands have sent before? Then they will come to you swearing by God: We did not desire anything but good and concord. Those men, God knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them, but admonish them, and speak to them a word to reach their very souls. Those are they, the secrets of whose hearts God knoweth. So oppose them and admonish them, and address them in plain terms about their souls. These are they of whom God knows what is in their hearts; therefore turn aside from them and admonish them, and speak to them effectual words concerning themselves. We sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will of God. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee and asked God's forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found God indeed Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by God's leave. And if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of God, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have found God Forgiving, Merciful. And We did not send any messenger but that he should be obeyed by God's permission; and had they, when they were unjust to themselves, come to you and asked forgiveness of God and the Messenger had also asked forgiveness for them, they would have found God Oft-returning to mercy, Merciful. But no, by the Lord, they can have no real faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction. But nay, by thy Lord, they will not believe in truth until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decidest, and submit with full submission. But no! by your Lord! they do not believe in reality until they make you a judge of that which has become a matter of disagreement among them, and then do not find any straitness in their hearts as to what you have decided and submit with entire submission. If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were actually told, it would have been best for them, and would have gone farthest to strengthen their faith. And if We had decreed for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your dwellings, but few of them would have done it; though if they did what they are exhorted to do it would be better for them, and more strengthening. And if We had prescribed for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your homes, they would not have done it except a few of them; and if they had done what they were admonished, it would have certainly been better for them and best in strengthening them. And We should then have given them from our presence a great reward. And then We should bestow upon them from Our presence an immense reward. And then We would certainly have given them from Ourselves a great reward. And We should have shown them the Straight Way. And should guide them unto a straight path. And We would certainly have guided them in the right path. All who obey God and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of God, of the prophets who teach, the sincere lovers of Truth, the witnesses who testify, and the righteous who do good: Ah! what a beautiful fellowship! Whoso obeyeth God and the messenger, they are with those unto whom God hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they! And whoever obeysl of (your duty to) God; and if you disbelieve, then surely whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is God's and God is Self-sufficient, Praise-worthy. Yea, unto God belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and enough is God to carry through all affairs. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. And God is sufficient as Defender. And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is God's, and God is sufficient as a Protector. If it were His will, He could destroy you, O mankind, and create another race; for He hath power this to do. If He will, He can remove you, O people, and produce others (in your stead). God is Able to do that. If He please, He can make you pass away, O people! and bring others; and God has the power to do this. If any one desires a reward in this life, in God's (gift) is the reward (both) of this life and of the hereafter: for God is He that heareth and seeth (all things). Whoso desireth the reward of the world, (let him know that) with God is the reward of the world and the Hereafter. God is ever Hearer, Seer. Whoever desires the reward of this world, then with God is the reward of this world and the hereafter; and God is Hearing, Seeing. O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. O ye who believe! Be ye staunch in justice, witnesses for God, even though it be against yourselves or (your) parents or (your) kindred, whether (the case be of) a rich man or a poor man, for God is nearer unto both (them ye are). So follow not passion lest ye lapse (from truth) and if ye lapse or fall away, then lo! God is ever Informed of what ye do. O you who believe! be maintainers of justice, bearers of witness of God's sake, though it may be against your own selves or (your) parents or near relatives; if he be rich or poor, God is nearer to them both in compassion; therefore do not follow (your) low desires, lest you deviate; and if you swerve or turn aside, then surely God is aware of what you do. O ye who believe! Believe in God and His Messenger, and the scripture which He hath sent to His Messenger and the scripture which He sent to those before (him). Any who denieth God, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Day of Judgment, hath gone far, far astray. O ye who believe! Believe in God and His messenger and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger, and the Scripture which He revealed aforetime. Whoso disbelieveth in God and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers and the Last Day, he verily hath wandered far astray. O you who believe! believe in God and His Messenger and the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger and the Book which He revealed before; and whoever disbelieves in God and His angels and His messengers and the last day, he indeed strays off into a remote error. Those who believe, then reject faith, then believe (again) and (again) reject faith, and go on increasing in unbelief,- God will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way. Lo! those who believe, then disbelieve and then (again) believe, then disbelieve, and then increase in disbelief, God will never pardon them, nor will He guide them unto a way. Surely (as for) those who believe then disbelieve, again believe and again disbelieve, then increase in disbelief, God will not forgive them nor guide them in the (right) path. To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them (but) a grievous penalty;- Bear unto the hypocrites the tidings that for them there is a painful doom; Announce to the hypocrites that they shall have a painful chastisement: Yea, to those who take for friends unbelievers rather than believers: is it honour they seek among them? Nay,- all honour is with God. Those who chose disbelievers for their friends instead of believers! Do they look for power at their hands? Lo! all power appertaineth to God. Those who take the unbelievers for guardians rather than believers. Do they seek honor from them? Then surely all honor is for God. Already has He sent you Word in the Book, that when ye hear the signs of God held in defiance and ridicule, ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme: if ye did, ye would be like them. For God will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell:- He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture that, when ye hear the revelations of God rejected and derided, (ye) sit not with them (who disbelieve and mock) until they engage in some other conversation. Lo! in that case (if ye stayed) ye would be like unto them. Lo! God will gather hypocrites and disbelievers, all together, into hell; And indeed He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear God's communications disbelieved in and mocked at do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse; surely then you would be like them; surely God will gather together the hypocrites and the unbelievers all in hell. (These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from God, they say: "Were we not with you?"- but if the unbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): "Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?" but God will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will God grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers. Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and, if a victory cometh unto you from God, say: Are we not with you? and if the disbelievers meet with a success say: Had we not the mastery of you, and did we not protect you from the believers? - God will judge between you at the Day of Resurrection, and God will not give the disbelievers any way (of success) against the believers. Those who wait for (some misfortune to befall) you; then if you have a victory from God they say: Were we not with you? And if there is a chance for the unbelievers, they say: Did we not acquire the mastery over you and defend you from the believers? So God shall Judge between you on the day of resurrection, and God will by no means give the unbelievers a way against the believers. The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching God, but He will over-reach them: When they stand up to prayer, they stand without earnestness, to be seen of men, but little do they hold God in remembrance; Lo! the hypocrites seek to beguile God, but it is He Who beguileth them. When they stand up to worship they perform it languidly and to be seen of men, and are mindful of God but little; Surely the hypocrites strive to deceive God, and He shall requite their deceit to them, and when they stand up to prayer they stand up sluggishly; they do it only to be seen of men and do not remember God save a little. (They are) distracted in mind even in the midst of it,- being (sincerely) for neither one group nor for another whom God leaves straying,- never wilt thou find for him the way. Swaying between this (and that), (belonging) neither to these nor to those. He whom God causeth to go astray, thou (O Muhammad) wilt not find a way for him: Wavering between that (and this), (belonging) neither to these nor to those; and whomsoever God causes to err, you shall not find a way for him. O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer God an open proof against yourselves? O ye who believe! Choose not disbelievers for (your) friends in place of believers. Would ye give God a clear warrant against you? O you who believe! do not take the unbelievers for friends rather than the believers; do you desire that you should give to God a manifest proof against yourselves? The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire: no helper wilt thou find for them;- Lo! the hypocrites (will be) in the lowest deep of the Fire, and thou wilt find no helper for them; Surely the hypocrites are in the lowest stage of the fire and you shall not find a helper for them. Except for those who repent, mend (their lives) hold fast to God, and purify their religion as in God's sight: if so they will be (numbered) with the believers. And soon will God grant to the believers a reward of immense value. Save those who repent and amend and hold fast to God and make their religion pure for God (only). Those are with the believers. And God will bestow on the believers an immense reward. Except those who repent and amend and hold fast to God and are sincere in their religion to God, these are with the believers, and God will grant the believers a mighty reward. What can God gain by your punishment, if ye are grateful and ye believe? Nay, it is God that recogniseth (all good), and knoweth all things. What concern hath God for your punishment if ye are thankful (for His mercies) and believe (in Him)? God was ever Responsive, Aware. Why should God chastise you if you are grateful and believe? And God is the Multiplier of rewards, Knowing. God loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech, except where injustice hath been done; for God is He who heareth and knoweth all things. God loveth not the utterance of harsh speech save by one who hath been wronged. God is ever Hearer, Knower. God does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech unless (it be) by one to whom injustice has been done; and God is Hearing, Knowing. Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon, verily God doth blot out (sins) and hath power (in the judgment of values). If ye do good openly or keep it secret, or forgive evil, lo! God is ever Forgiving, Powerful. If you do good openly or do it in secret or pardon an evil then surely God is Pardoning, Powerful. Those who deny God and His messengers, and (those who) wish to separate God from His messengers, saying: "We believe in some but reject others": And (those who) wish to take a course midway,- Lo! those who disbelieve in God and His messengers, and seek to make distinction between God and His messengers, and say: We believe in some and disbelieve in others, and seek to choose a way in between; Surely those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and (those who) desire to make a distinction between God and His"God and the Messenger, these are with those upon whom God has bestowed favors from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the good, and a goodly company are they! Such is the bounty from God: And sufficient is it that God knoweth all. O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties or go forth all together. There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you, they say: 'God did favor us in that we were not present among them.' But if good fortune comes to you from God, they would be sure to say - as if there had never been ties of affection between you and them - 'Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!' Let those fight in the cause of God who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fights in the cause of God, whether he is slain or gets victory, soon shall We give him a reward of great value. And why should ye not fight in the cause of God and of those who, being weak, are ill-treated and oppressed? Men, women, and children, whose cry is: 'Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from Thee one who will protect; and raise for us from Thee one who will help!' Those who believe fight in the cause of God, and those who reject faith fight in the cause of evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan. Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands from fight but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity? When the order for fighting was issued to them, behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared God: They said: 'Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not grant us respite to our natural term, near enough?' Say: 'Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!' Wherever ye are, death will find you out, even if ye are in towers built up strong and high! If some good befalls them, they say, 'This is from God'; but if evil, they say, 'This is from thee.' Say: 'All things are from God.' But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact? Whatever good happens to thee, is from God; but whatever evil happens to thee, is from thy own soul. And We have sent thee as a messenger to instruct mankind. And enough is God for a witness. He who obeys the Messenger, obeys God: But if any turn away, We have not sent thee to watch over their evil deeds. They have 'Obedience' on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section of them meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But God records their nightly plots: So keep clear of them, and put thy trust in God, and enough is God as a disposer of affairs. Do they not consider the Qur'an with care? Had it been from other than God, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy. When there comes to them some matter touching public safety or fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger, or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have tested it from them directly. Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of God unto you, all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan. Then fight in God's cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers. It may be that God will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for God is the strongest in might and in punishment. Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein: And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause, shares in its burden: And God hath power over all things."Whoso interveneth in a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whoso interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof. God oversees all things. When a courteous greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or at least of equal courtesy. God takes careful account of all things. God! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than God's? Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? God hath upset them for their evil deeds. Would ye guide those whom God hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom God hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way. They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing as they. But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of God. But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty of peace, or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If God had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and instead send you guarantees of peace, then God hath opened no way for you to war against them. Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people. Every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto. If they withdraw not from you nor give you guarantees of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them. In their case, We have provided you with a clear argument against them. Never should a believer kill a believer; but if it so happens by mistake, compensation is due. If one kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave and pay compensation to the deceased's family, unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave is enough. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, a fast for two months running is prescribed by way of repentance to God. For God hath all knowledge and all wisdom. If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein forever. And the wrath and the curse of God are upon him, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him. O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of God, investigate carefully, and say not to anyone who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none of a believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with God are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till God conferred on you His favors. Therefore carefully investigate. For God is well aware of all that ye do. Not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home. Unto all in Faith hath God promised good, but those who strive and fight hath He distinguished above those who sit at home by a special reward. Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: "In what plight were ye?" They reply: "Weak and oppressed were we in the earth.""Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to move yourselves away from evil?" Such men will find their abode in Hell, an evil refuge. Those whom the angels take in death while they wrong themselves will be asked: "In what were you engaged?" They will say: "We were oppressed in the land." The angels will say: "Was not God's earth spacious that you could have migrated therein?" Their habitation will be Hell, an evil journey's end. Except those who are weak and oppressed—men, women, and children—who have no means in their power nor a guide-post to their way. For these, there is hope that God will forgive: For God blots out sins and forgives again and again. He who forsakes his home in the cause of God finds in the earth many a refuge, wide and spacious. Should he die as a refugee from home for God and His Messenger, his reward becomes due and sure with God: And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the Unbelievers may attack you: For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you are among them and arrange their worship, let one party stand up in prayer with you, taking their arms with them. When they finish their prostrations, let them take their position in the rear. Let the other party come up which has not yet prayed and let them pray with you, taking all precaution and bearing arms. The Unbelievers wish, if you were negligent of your arms and baggage, to assault you in a single rush. There is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take every precaution for yourselves. For the Unbelievers, God has prepared a humiliating punishment. When you have performed the act of worship, remember God, standing, sitting, and reclining. When you are in safety, observe proper worship. Worship at fixed times has been enjoined on the believers. Do not slacken in following up the enemy: If you are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but you have hope from God, while they have none. God is full of knowledge and wisdom. We have sent down to you the Book in truth, that you might judge between men as guided by God: so be not used as an advocate by those who betray their trust. Seek the forgiveness of God; for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Do not contend on behalf of those who betray their own souls; for God loves not one given to perfidy and crime. They may hide their crimes from men, but they cannot hide them from God, seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night in words that He cannot approve. God encompasses all that they do. These are the sort of men on whose behalf you may contend in this world; but who will contend with God on their behalf on the Day of Judgment, or who will carry their affairs through? If anyone does evil or wrongs his own soul but afterwards seeks God's forgiveness, he will find God Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. If anyone earns sin, he earns it against his own soul: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom. If anyone earns a fault or a sin and throws it onto one that is innocent, he carries both a falsehood and a flagrant sin. But for the Grace of God to you and His Mercy, a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead you astray. But in fact, they will only lead their own souls astray, and to you, they can do no harm in the least. For God has sent down to you the Book and wisdom and taught you what you knew not before: And great is the Grace of God unto you. In most of their secret talks, there is no good: But if one exhorts to a deed of charity or justice or conciliation between men, secrecy is permissible. To him who does this, seeking the good pleasure of God, We shall soon give a reward of the highest value."messengers and say: We believe in some and disbelieve in others, and desire to take a course between (this and) that. 004.151 Y: They are in truth (equally) unbelievers; and we have prepared for unbelievers a humiliating punishment. P: Such are disbelievers in truth; and for disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom. S: These it is that are truly unbelievers, and We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement. 004.152 Y: To those who believe in God and His messengers and make no distinction between any of the messengers, we shall soon give their (due) rewards: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: But those who believe in God and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them, unto them God will give their wages; and God was ever Forgiving, Merciful. S: And those who believe in God and His messengers and do not make a distinction between any of them God will grant them their rewards; and God is Forgiving, Merciful. 004.153 Y: The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater (miracle), for they said: "Show us God in public," but they were dazed for their presumption, with thunder and lightning. Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs had come to them; even so we forgave them; and gave Moses manifest proofs of authority. P: The people of the Scripture ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an (actual) Book to descend upon them from heaven. They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime, for they said: Show us God plainly. The storm of lightning seized them for their wickedness. Then (even after that) they chose the calf (for worship) after clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty) had come unto them. And We forgave them that! And We bestowed on Moses evident authority. S: The followers of the Book ask you to bring down to them a book from heaven; so indeed they demanded of Musa a greater thing than that, for they said: Show us God manifestly; so the lightning overtook them on account of their injustice. Then they took the calf (for a god), after clear signs had come to them, but We pardoned this; and We gave to Musa clear authority. 004.154 Y: And for their covenant we raised over them (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai); and (on another occasion) we said: "Enter the gate with humility"; and (once again) we commanded them: "Transgress not in the matter of the Sabbath." And we took from them a solemn covenant. P: And We caused the Mount to tower above them at (the taking of) their covenant: and We bade them: Enter the gate, prostrate! and We bode them: Transgress not the Sabbath! and We took from them a firm covenant. S: And We lifted the mountain (Sainai) over them at (the taking of the covenant) and We said to them: Enter the door making obeisance; and We said to them: Do not exceed the limits of the Sabbath, and We made with them a firm covenant. 004.155 Y: (They have incurred divine displeasure): In that they broke their covenant; that they rejected the signs of God; that they slew the Messengers in defiance of right; that they said, "Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve God's Word; We need no more)";- Nay, God hath set the seal on their hearts for their blasphemy, and little is it they believe;- P: Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in the revelations of God, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and their saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but God set a seal upon them for their disbelief, so that they believe not save a few - S: Therefore, for their breaking their covenant and their disbelief in the communications of God and their killing the prophets wrongfully and their saying: Our hearts are covered; nay! God set a seal upon them owing to their unbelief, so they shall not believe except a few. 004.156 Y: That they rejected Faith; that they uttered against Mary a grave false charge; P: And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny; S: And for their unbelief and for their having uttered against Marium a grievous calumny. 004.157 Y: That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of God";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- P: And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, God's messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain. S: And their saying: Surely we have killed the Messiah, Isa son of Marium, the messenger of God; and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them so (like Isa) and most surely those who differ therein are only in a doubt about it; they have no knowledge respecting it, but only follow a conjecture, and they killed him not for sure. 004.158Y: Nay, God raised him up unto Himself; and God is Exalted in Power, Wise;- P: But God took him up unto Himself. God was ever Mighty, Wise. S: Nay! God took him up to Himself; and God is Mighty, Wise. 004.159 Y: And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them;- P: There is not one of the People of the Scripture but will believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them - S: And there is not one of the followers of the Book but most certainly believes in this before his death, and on the day of resurrection he (Isa) shall be a witness against them. 004.160 Y: For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain (foods) good and wholesome which had been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many from God's Way;- P: Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which were (before) made lawful unto them, and because of their much hindering from God's way, S: Wherefore for the iniquity of those who are Jews did We disallow to them the good things which had been made lawful for them and for their hindering many (people) from God's way. 004.161 Y: That they took usury, though they were forbidden; and that they devoured men's substance wrongfully;- we have prepared for those among them who reject faith a grievous punishment. P: And of their taking usury when they were forbidden it, and of their devouring people's wealth by false pretences, We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a painful doom. S: And their taking usury though indeed they were forbidden it and their devouring the property of people falsely, and We have prepared for the unbelievers from among them a painful chastisement. 004.162 Y: But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what hath been revealed to thee and what was revealed before thee: And (especially) those who establish regular prayer and practise regular charity and believe in God and in the Last Day: To them shall We soon give a great reward. P: But those of them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in that which is revealed unto thee, and that which was revealed before thee, especially the diligent in prayer and those who pay the poor-due, the believers in God and the Last Day. Upon these We shall bestow immense reward. S: But the firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, and those who keep up prayers and those who give the poor-rate and the believers in God and the last day, these it is whom We will give a mighty reward. 004.163Y: We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. P: Lo! We inspire thee as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, as We inspired Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and as We imparted unto David the Psalms; S: Surely We have revealed to you as We revealed to Nuh, and the prophets after him, and We revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes, and Isa and Ayub and Yunus and Haroun and Sulaiman and We gave to Dawood Psalms. 004.164 Y: Of some messengers We have already told thee the story; of others We have not;- and to Moses God spoke direct;- P: And messengers We have mentioned unto thee before and messengers We have not mentioned unto thee; and God spake directly unto Moses; S: And (We sent) messengers We have mentioned to you before and messengers we have not mentioned to you; and to Musa, God addressed His Word, speaking (to him): 004.165Y: Messengers who gave good news as well as warning, that mankind, after (the coming) of the messengers, should have no plea against God: For God is Exalted in Power, Wise. P: Messengers of good cheer and of warning, in order that mankind might have no argument against God after the messengers. God was ever Mighty, Wise. S: (We sent) messengers as the givers of good news and as warners, so that people should not have a plea against God after the (coming of) messengers; and God is Mighty, Wise. 004.166 Y: But God beareth witness that what He hath sent unto thee He hath sent from His (own) knowledge, and the angels bear witness: But enough is God for a witness. P: But God (Himself) testifieth concerning that which He hath revealeth unto thee; in His knowledge hath He revealed it; and the angels also testify. And God is sufficient Witness. S: But God bears witness by what He has revealed to you that He has revealed it with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness (also); and God is sufficient as a witness. 004.167 Y: Those who reject Faith and keep off (men) from the way of God, have verily strayed far, far away from the Path. P: Lo! those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from the way of God, they verily have wandered far astray. S: Surely (as for) those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from God's way, they indeed have strayed off into a remote error. 004.168 Y: Those who reject Faith and do wrong,- God will not forgive them nor guide them to any way- P: Lo! those who disbelieve and deal in wrong, God will never forgive them, neither will He guide them unto a road, S: Surely (as for) those who disbelieve and act unjustly God will not forgive them nor guide them to a path, 004.169 Y: Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein for ever. And this to God is easy. P: Except the road of hell, wherein they will abide for ever. And that is ever easy for God. S: Except the path of hell, to abide in it""There is no good in most of their secret counsels except in those who enjoin charity, goodness, or reconciliation between people. Whoever does this seeking God's pleasure, We will give him a mighty reward. If anyone contends with the Messenger after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him and follows a path other than that of the believers, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen and land him in Hell, an evil refuge. God does not forgive the sin of associating others with Him, but He forgives other sins for whom He pleases. Whoever associates others with God has strayed far away. The pagans call upon female deities and Satan, the persistent rebel. God cursed him, and he said, 'I will take a portion of Your servants and mislead them, arouse desires in them, and command them to alter God's creation.' Whoever takes Satan as a friend suffers a manifest loss. Satan makes promises and creates false desires, but his promises are nothing but deception. Those who follow him will have their dwelling in Hell, with no escape. But those who believe and do righteous deeds will enter gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to dwell therein forever. God's promise is the truth, and whose word can be truer than God's? It will not be according to your desires or those of the People of the Book. Whoever does evil will be requited accordingly and will find no protector or helper besides God. Whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, will enter Paradise and not be wronged in the least. Who can be better in religion than one who submits to God, does good, and follows the way of Abraham, whom God took as a friend? To God belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and He encompasses all things. They ask for instruction concerning women. Say: God instructs you about them and about the orphans of women to whom you do not give the portions prescribed, yet whom you desire to marry, and concerning the weak among children. Stand firm for justice to orphans. Whatever good you do, God is well-acquainted with it. If a wife fears cruelty or desertion from her husband, there is no blame if they arrange an amicable settlement. Such settlement is best, even though men's souls are swayed by greed. If you do good and practice self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that you do. You are never able to be fair and just between women, even if it is your ardent desire. But do not turn away altogether, leaving her hanging. If you come to a friendly understanding and practice self-restraint, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. If they disagree and must part, God will provide abundance for all from His bounty. God cares for all and is Wise. To God belong all things in the heavens and on earth. We have directed the People of the Book before you, and you, to fear God. If you deny Him, unto God belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and God is free of all wants, worthy of all praise."l of (your duty to) God; and if you disbelieve, then surely whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is God's and God is Self-sufficient, Praise-worthy. Yea, unto God belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and enough is God to carry through all affairs. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. And God is sufficient as Defender. And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is God's, and God is sufficient as a Protector. If it were His will, He could destroy you, O mankind, and create another race; for He hath power this to do. If He will, He can remove you, O people, and produce others (in your stead). God is Able to do that. If He please, He can make you pass away, O people! and bring others; and God has the power to do this. If any one desires a reward in this life, in God's (gift) is the reward (both) of this life and of the hereafter: for God is He that heareth and seeth (all things). Whoso desireth the reward of the world, (let him know that) with God is the reward of the world and the Hereafter. God is ever Hearer, Seer. Whoever desires the reward of this world, then with God is the reward of this world and the hereafter; and God is Hearing, Seeing. O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. O ye who believe! Be ye staunch in justice, witnesses for God, even though it be against yourselves or (your) parents or (your) kindred, whether (the case be of) a rich man or a poor man, for God is nearer unto both (them ye are). So follow not passion lest ye lapse (from truth) and if ye lapse or fall away, then lo! God is ever Informed of what ye do. O you who believe! be maintainers of justice, bearers of witness of God's sake, though it may be against your own selves or (your) parents or near relatives; if he be rich or poor, God is nearer to them both in compassion; therefore do not follow (your) low desires, lest you deviate; and if you swerve or turn aside, then surely God is aware of what you do. O ye who believe! Believe in God and His Messenger, and the scripture which He hath sent to His Messenger and the scripture which He sent to those before (him). Any who denieth God, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Day of Judgment, hath gone far, far astray. O ye who believe! Believe in God and His messenger and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger, and the Scripture which He revealed aforetime. Whoso disbelieveth in God and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers and the Last Day, he verily hath wandered far astray. O you who believe! believe in God and His Messenger and the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger and the Book which He revealed before; and whoever disbelieves in God and His angels and His messengers and the last day, he indeed strays off into a remote error. Those who believe, then reject faith, then believe (again) and (again) reject faith, and go on increasing in unbelief,- God will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way. Lo! those who believe, then disbelieve and then (again) believe, then disbelieve, and then increase in disbelief, God will never pardon them, nor will He guide them unto a way. Surely (as for) those who believe then disbelieve, again believe and again disbelieve, then increase in disbelief, God will not forgive them nor guide them in the (right) path. To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them (but) a grievous penalty;- Bear unto the hypocrites the tidings that for them there is a painful doom; Announce to the hypocrites that they shall have a painful chastisement: Yea, to those who take for friends unbelievers rather than believers: is it honour they seek among them? Nay,- all honour is with God. Those who chose disbelievers for their friends instead of believers! Do they look for power at their hands? Lo! all power appertaineth to God. Those who take the unbelievers for guardians rather than believers. Do they seek honor from them? Then surely all honor is for God. Already has He sent you Word in the Book, that when ye hear the signs of God held in defiance and ridicule, ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme: if ye did, ye would be like them. For God will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell:- He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture that, when ye hear the revelations of God rejected and derided, (ye) sit not with them (who disbelieve and mock) until they engage in some other conversation. Lo! in that case (if ye stayed) ye would be like unto them. Lo! God will gather hypocrites and disbelievers, all together, into hell; And indeed He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear God's communications disbelieved in and mocked at do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse; surely then you would be like them; surely God will gather together the hypocrites and the unbelievers all in hell. (These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from God, they say: "Were we not with you?"- but if the unbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): "Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?" but God will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will God grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers. Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and, if a victory cometh unto you from God, say: Are we not with you? and if the disbelievers meet with a success say: Had we not the mastery of you, and did we not protect you from the believers? - God will judge between you at the Day of Resurrection, and God will not give the disbelievers any way (of success) against the believers. Those who wait for (some misfortune to befall) you; then if you have a victory from God they say: Were we not with you? And if there is a chance for the unbelievers, they say: Did we not acquire the mastery over you and defend you from the believers? So God shall Judge between you on the day of resurrection, and God will by no means give the unbelievers a way against the believers. The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching God, but He will over-reach them: When they stand up to prayer, they stand without earnestness, to be seen of men, but little do they hold God in remembrance; Lo! the hypocrites seek to beguile God, but it is He Who beguileth them. When they stand up to worship they perform it languidly and to be seen of men, and are mindful of God but little; Surely the hypocrites strive to deceive God, and He shall requite their deceit to them, and when they stand up to prayer they stand up sluggishly; they do it only to be seen of men and do not remember God save a little. (They are) distracted in mind even in the midst of it,- being (sincerely) for neither one group nor for another whom God leaves straying,- never wilt thou find for him the way. Swaying between this (and that), (belonging) neither to these nor to those. He whom God causeth to go astray, thou (O Muhammad) wilt not find a way for him: Wavering between that (and this), (belonging) neither to these nor to those; and whomsoever God causes to err, you shall not find a way for him. O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer God an open proof against yourselves? O ye who believe! Choose not disbelievers for (your) friends in place of believers. Would ye give God a clear warrant against you? O you who believe! do not take the unbelievers for friends rather than the believers; do you desire that you should give to God a manifest proof against yourselves? The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire: no helper wilt thou find for them;- Lo! the hypocrites (will be) in the lowest deep of the Fire, and thou wilt find no helper for them; Surely the hypocrites are in the lowest stage of the fire and you shall not find a helper for them. Except for those who repent, mend (their lives) hold fast to God, and purify their religion as in God's sight: if so they will be (numbered) with the believers. And soon will God grant to the believers a reward of immense value. Save those who repent and amend and hold fast to God and make their religion pure for God (only). Those are with the believers. And God will bestow on the believers an immense reward. Except those who repent and amend and hold fast to God and are sincere in their religion to God, these are with the believers, and God will grant the believers a mighty reward. What can God gain by your punishment, if ye are grateful and ye believe? Nay, it is God that recogniseth (all good), and knoweth all things. What concern hath God for your punishment if ye are thankful (for His mercies) and believe (in Him)? God was ever Responsive, Aware. Why should God chastise you if you are grateful and believe? And God is the Multiplier of rewards, Knowing. God loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech, except where injustice hath been done; for God is He who heareth and knoweth all things. God loveth not the utterance of harsh speech save by one who hath been wronged. God is ever Hearer, Knower. God does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech unless (it be) by one to whom injustice has been done; and God is Hearing, Knowing. Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon, verily God doth blot out (sins) and hath power (in the judgment of values). If ye do good openly or keep it secret, or forgive evil, lo! God is ever Forgiving, Powerful. If you do good openly or do it in secret or pardon an evil then surely God is Pardoning, Powerful. Those who deny God and His messengers, and (those who) wish to separate God from His messengers, saying: "We believe in some but reject others": And (those who) wish to take a course midway,- Lo! those who disbelieve in God and His messengers, and seek to make distinction between God and His messengers, and say: We believe in some and disbelieve in others, and seek to choose a way in between; Surely those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and (those who) desire to make a distinction between God and Hisfor ever, and this is easy to God. 004.170 Y: O Mankind! The Messenger hath come to you in truth from God: believe in him: It is best for you. But if ye reject Faith, to God belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. P: O mankind! The messenger hath come unto you with the Truth from your Lord. Therefore believe; (it is) better for you. But if ye disbelieve, still, lo! unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. God is ever Knower, Wise. S: O people! surely the Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, therefore believe, (it shall be) good for you and If you disbelieve, then surely whatever is in the heavens and the earth is God's; and God is Knowing, Wise. 004.171 Y: O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of God aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of God, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in God and His messengers. Say not "Trinity": desist: it will be better for you: for God is one God: Glory be to Him: (far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is God as a Disposer of affairs. P: O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning God save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of God, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and say not "Three" - Cease! (it is) better for you! - God is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And God is sufficient as Defender. S: O followers of the Book! do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not speak (lies) against God, but (speak) the truth; the Messiah, Isa son of Marium is only a messenger of God and His Word which He communicated to Marium and a spirit from Him; believe therefore in God and His messengers, and say not, Three. Desist, it is better for you; God is only one God; far be It from His glory that He should have a son, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His, and God is sufficient for a Protector. 004.172 Y: Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship God, nor do the angels, those nearest (to God): those who disdain His worship and are arrogant,-He will gather them all together unto Himself to (answer). P: The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto God, nor will the favoured angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He assemble unto Him; S: The Messiah does by no means disdain that he should be a servant of God, nor do the angels who are near to Him, and whoever disdains His service and is proud, He will gather them all together to Himself. 004.173 Y: But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, He will give their (due) rewards,- and more, out of His bounty: But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish with a grievous penalty; Nor will they find, besides God, any to protect or help them. P: Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find for them, against God, any protecting friend or helper. S: Then as for those who believe and do good, He will pay them fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace; and as for those who disdain and are proud, He will chastise them with a painful chastisement. And they shall not find for themselves besides God a guardian or a helper. 004.174 Y: O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord: For We have sent unto you a light (that is) manifest. P: O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have sent down unto you a clear light; S: O people! surely there has come to you manifest proof from your Lord and We have sent to you clear light. 004.175 Y: Then those who believe in God, and hold fast to Him,- soon will He admit them to mercy and grace from Himself, and guide them to Himself by a straight way. P: As for those who believe in God, and hold fast unto Him, them He will cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a straight road. S: Then as for those who believe in God and hold fast by Him, He will cause them to enter into His mercy and grace and guide them to Himself on a right path. 004.176 Y: They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: God directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance: If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, Her brother takes her inheritance: If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance (between them): if there are brothers and sisters, (they share), the male having twice the share of the female. Thus doth God make clear to you (His law), lest ye err. And God hath knowledge of all things. P: They ask thee for a pronouncement. Say: God hath pronounced for you concerning distant kindred. If a man die childless and he have a sister, hers is half the heritage, and he would have inherited from her had she died childless. And if there be two sisters, then theirs are two-thirds of the heritage, and if they be brethren, men and women, unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females. God expoundeth unto you, so that ye err not. God is Knower of all things. S: They ask you for a decision of the law. Say: God gives you a decision concerning the person who has neither parents nor offspring; if a man dies (and) he has no son and he has a sister, she shall have half of what he leaves, and he shall be her heir she has no son; but if there be two (sisters), they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves; and if there are brethren, men and women, then the male shall have the like of the portion of two females; God makes clear to you, lest you err; and God knows all things. - Chapter 5: AL-MAEDA (THE TABLE, THE TABLE SPREAD) Total Verses: 120 Revealed At: MADINA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 005.001 Y: O ye who believe! fulfil (all) obligations. Lawful unto you (for food) are all four-footed animals, with the exceptions named: But animals of the chase are forbidden while ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb: for God doth command according to His will and plan. P: O ye who believe! Fulfil your indentures. The beast of cattle is made lawful unto you (for food) except that which is announced unto you (herein), game being unlawful when ye are on the pilgrimage. Lo! God ordaineth that which pleaseth Him. S: O you who believe! fulfill the obligations. The cattle quadrupeds are allowed to you except that which is recited to you, not violating the prohibition against game when you are entering upon the performance of the pilgrimage; surely God orders what He desires. 005.002 Y: O ye who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of God, nor of the sacred month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands that mark out such animals, nor the people resorting to the sacred house, seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancour: fear God: for God is strict in punishment. P: O ye who believe! Profane not God's monuments nor the Sacred Month nor the offerings nor the garlands, nor those repairing to the Sacred House, seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord. But when ye have left the sacred territory, then go hunting (if ye will). And let not your hatred of a folk who (once) stopped your going to the inviolable place of worship seduce you to transgress; but help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another unto sin and transgression, but keep your duty to God. Lo! God is severe in punishment. S: O you who believe! do not violate the signs appointed by God nor the sacred month, nor (interfere with) the offerings, nor the sacrificial animals with garlands, nor those going to the sacred house seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord; and when you are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage, then hunt, and let not hatred of a people because they hindered you from the Sacred Masjid incite you to exceed the limits, and help one another in goodness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and aggression; and be careful of (your duty to) God; surely God is severe in requiting (evil). 005.003 Y: Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than God; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, God is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: Forbidden unto you (for food) are carrion and blood and swineflesh, and that which hath been dedicated unto any other than God, and the strangled, and the dead through beating, and the dead through falling from a height, and that which hath been killed by (the goring of) horns, and the devoured of wild beasts, saving that which ye make lawful (by the death-stroke), and that which hath been immolated unto idols. And (forbidden is it) that ye swear by the divining arrows. This is an abomination. This day are those who disbelieve in despair of (ever harming) your religion; so fear them not, fear Me! This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed My favour unto you, and have chosen for you as religion al-Islam. Whoso is forced by hunger, not by will, to sin: (for him) lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of God has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with"messengers and say: We believe in some and disbelieve in others, and desire to take a course between (this and) that. 004.151 Y: They are in truth (equally) unbelievers; and we have prepared for unbelievers a humiliating punishment. P: Such are disbelievers in truth; and for disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom. S: These it is that are truly unbelievers, and We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement. 004.152 Y: To those who believe in God and His messengers and make no distinction between any of the messengers, we shall soon give their (due) rewards: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: But those who believe in God and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them, unto them God will give their wages; and God was ever Forgiving, Merciful. S: And those who believe in God and His messengers and do not make a distinction between any of them God will grant them their rewards; and God is Forgiving, Merciful. 004.153 Y: The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater (miracle), for they said: "Show us God in public," but they were dazed for their presumption, with thunder and lightning. Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs had come to them; even so we forgave them; and gave Moses manifest proofs of authority. P: The people of the Scripture ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an (actual) Book to descend upon them from heaven. They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime, for they said: Show us God plainly. The storm of lightning seized them for their wickedness. Then (even after that) they chose the calf (for worship) after clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty) had come unto them. And We forgave them that! And We bestowed on Moses evident authority. S: The followers of the Book ask you to bring down to them a book from heaven; so indeed they demanded of Musa a greater thing than that, for they said: Show us God manifestly; so the lightning overtook them on account of their injustice. Then they took the calf (for a god), after clear signs had come to them, but We pardoned this; and We gave to Musa clear authority. 004.154 Y: And for their covenant we raised over them (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai); and (on another occasion) we said: "Enter the gate with humility"; and (once again) we commanded them: "Transgress not in the matter of the Sabbath." And we took from them a solemn covenant. P: And We caused the Mount to tower above them at (the taking of) their covenant: and We bade them: Enter the gate, prostrate! and We bode them: Transgress not the Sabbath! and We took from them a firm covenant. S: And We lifted the mountain (Sainai) over them at (the taking of the covenant) and We said to them: Enter the door making obeisance; and We said to them: Do not exceed the limits of the Sabbath, and We made with them a firm covenant. 004.155 Y: (They have incurred divine displeasure): In that they broke their covenant; that they rejected the signs of God; that they slew the Messengers in defiance of right; that they said, "Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve God's Word; We need no more)";- Nay, God hath set the seal on their hearts for their blasphemy, and little is it they believe;- P: Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in the revelations of God, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and their saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but God set a seal upon them for their disbelief, so that they believe not save a few - S: Therefore, for their breaking their covenant and their disbelief in the communications of God and their killing the prophets wrongfully and their saying: Our hearts are covered; nay! God set a seal upon them owing to their unbelief, so they shall not believe except a few. 004.156 Y: That they rejected Faith; that they uttered against Mary a grave false charge; P: And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny; S: And for their unbelief and for their having uttered against Marium a grievous calumny. 004.157 Y: That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of God";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- P: And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, God's messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain. S: And their saying: Surely we have killed the Messiah, Isa son of Marium, the messenger of God; and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them so (like Isa) and most surely those who differ therein are only in a doubt about it; they have no knowledge respecting it, but only follow a conjecture, and they killed him not for sure. 004.158Y: Nay, God raised him up unto Himself; and God is Exalted in Power, Wise;- P: But God took him up unto Himself. God was ever Mighty, Wise. S: Nay! God took him up to Himself; and God is Mighty, Wise. 004.159 Y: And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them;- P: There is not one of the People of the Scripture but will believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them - S: And there is not one of the followers of the Book but most certainly believes in this before his death, and on the day of resurrection he (Isa) shall be a witness against them. 004.160 Y: For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain (foods) good and wholesome which had been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many from God's Way;- P: Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which were (before) made lawful unto them, and because of their much hindering from God's way, S: Wherefore for the iniquity of those who are Jews did We disallow to them the good things which had been made lawful for them and for their hindering many (people) from God's way. 004.161 Y: That they took usury, though they were forbidden; and that they devoured men's substance wrongfully;- we have prepared for those among them who reject faith a grievous punishment. P: And of their taking usury when they were forbidden it, and of their devouring people's wealth by false pretences, We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a painful doom. S: And their taking usury though indeed they were forbidden it and their devouring the property of people falsely, and We have prepared for the unbelievers from among them a painful chastisement. 004.162 Y: But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what hath been revealed to thee and what was revealed before thee: And (especially) those who establish regular prayer and practise regular charity and believe in God and in the Last Day: To them shall We soon give a great reward. P: But those of them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in that which is revealed unto thee, and that which was revealed before thee, especially the diligent in prayer and those who pay the poor-due, the believers in God and the Last Day. Upon these We shall bestow immense reward. S: But the firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, and those who keep up prayers and those who give the poor-rate and the believers in God and the last day, these it is whom We will give a mighty reward. 004.163Y: We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. P: Lo! We inspire thee as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, as We inspired Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and as We imparted unto David the Psalms; S: Surely We have revealed to you as We revealed to Nuh, and the prophets after him, and We revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes, and Isa and Ayub and Yunus and Haroun and Sulaiman and We gave to Dawood Psalms. 004.164 Y: Of some messengers We have already told thee the story; of others We have not;- and to Moses God spoke direct;- P: And messengers We have mentioned unto thee before and messengers We have not mentioned unto thee; and God spake directly unto Moses; S: And (We sent) messengers We have mentioned to you before and messengers we have not mentioned to you; and to Musa, God addressed His Word, speaking (to him): 004.165Y: Messengers who gave good news as well as warning, that mankind, after (the coming) of the messengers, should have no plea against God: For God is Exalted in Power, Wise. P: Messengers of good cheer and of warning, in order that mankind might have no argument against God after the messengers. God was ever Mighty, Wise. S: (We sent) messengers as the givers of good news and as warners, so that people should not have a plea against God after the (coming of) messengers; and God is Mighty, Wise. 004.166 Y: But God beareth witness that what He hath sent unto thee He hath sent from His (own) knowledge, and the angels bear witness: But enough is God for a witness. P: But God (Himself) testifieth concerning that which He hath revealeth unto thee; in His knowledge hath He revealed it; and the angels also testify. And God is sufficient Witness. S: But God bears witness by what He has revealed to you that He has revealed it with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness (also); and God is sufficient as a witness. 004.167 Y: Those who reject Faith and keep off (men) from the way of God, have verily strayed far, far away from the Path. P: Lo! those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from the way of God, they verily have wandered far astray. S: Surely (as for) those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from God's way, they indeed have strayed off into a remote error. 004.168 Y: Those who reject Faith and do wrong,- God will not forgive them nor guide them to any way- P: Lo! those who disbelieve and deal in wrong, God will never forgive them, neither will He guide them unto a road, S: Surely (as for) those who disbelieve and act unjustly God will not forgive them nor guide them to a path, 004.169 Y: Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein for ever. And this to God is easy. P: Except the road of hell, wherein they will abide for ever. And that is ever easy for God. S: Except the path of hell, to abide in it.""the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

005.004 Y: They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: lawful unto you are (all) things good and pure: and what ye have taught your trained hunting animals (to catch) in the manner directed to you by God: eat what they catch for you, but pronounce the name of God over it: and fear God; for God is swift in taking account. P: They ask thee (O Muhammad) what is made lawful for them. Say: (all) good things are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as hounds are trained, ye teach them that which God taught you; so eat of that which they catch for you and mention God's name upon it, and observe your duty to God. Lo! God is swift to take account. S: They ask you as to what is allowed to them. Say: The good things are allowed to you, and what you have taught the beasts and birds of prey, training them to hunt you teach them of what God has taught you so eat of that which they catch for you and mention the name of God over it; and be careful of (your duty to) God; surely God is swift in reckoning.

005.005 Y: This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time,- when ye give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues if any one rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good). P: This day are (all) good things made lawful for you. The food of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you (lawful for you) when ye give them their marriage portions and live with them in honour, not in fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines. Whoso denieth the faith, his work is vain and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter. S: This day (all) the good things are allowed to you; and the food of those who have been given the Book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them; and the chaste from among the believing women and the chaste from among those who have been given the Book before you (are lawful for you); when you have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.

005.006 Y: O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, God doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful. P: O ye who believe! When ye rise up for prayer, wash you faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and lightly rub your heads and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if ye are unclean, purify yourselves. And if ye are sick or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have had contact with women, and ye find not water, then go to clean, high ground and rub your faces and your hands with some of it. God would not place a burden on you, but He would purify you and would perfect His grace upon you, that ye may give thanks. S: O you who believe! when you rise up to prayer, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles; and if you are under an obligation to perform a total ablution, then wash (yourselves) and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or you have touched the women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith, God does not desire to put on you any difficulty, but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favor on you, so that you may be grateful.

005.007 Y: And call in remembrance the favour of God unto you, and His covenant, which He ratified with you, when ye said: "We hear and we obey": And fear God, for God knoweth well the secrets of your hearts. P: Remember God's grace upon you and His covenant by which He bound you when ye said: We hear and we obey; And keep your duty to God. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men). S: And remember the favor of God on you and His covenant with which He bound you firmly, when you said: We have heard and we obey, and be careful of (your duty to) God, surely God knows what is in the breasts.

005.008 Y: O ye who believe! stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. P: O ye who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for God in equity, and let not hatred of any people seduce you that ye deal not justly. Deal justly, that is nearer to your duty. Observe your duty to God. Lo! God is Informed of what ye do. S: O you who believe! Be upright for God, bearers of witness with justice, and let not hatred of a people incite you not to act equitably; act equitably, that is nearer to piety, and he careful of (your duty to) God; surely God is Aware of what you do.

005.009 Y: To those who believe and do deeds of righteousness hath God promised forgiveness and a great reward. P: God hath promised those who believe and do good works: Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward. S: God has promised to those who believe and do good deeds (that) they shall have forgiveness and a mighty reward.

005.010 Y: Those who reject faith and deny our signs will be companions of Hell-fire. P: And they who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, such are rightful owners of hell. S: And (as for) those who disbelieve and reject our communications, these are the companions of the name.

005.011 Y: O ye who believe! Call in remembrance the favour of God unto you when certain men formed the design to stretch out their hands against you, but (God) held back their hands from you: so fear God. And on God let believers put (all) their trust. P: O ye who believe! Remember God's favour unto you, how a people were minded to stretch out their hands against you but He withheld their hands from you; and keep your duty to God. In God let believers put their trust. S: O you who believe! remember God's favor on you when a people had determined to stretch forth their hands towards you, but He withheld their hands from you, and be careful of (your duty to) God; and on God let the believers rely.

005.012 Y: God did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we appointed twelve captains among them. And God said: "I am with you: if ye (but) establish regular prayers, practise regular charity, believe in my messengers, honour and assist them, and loan to God a beautiful loan, verily I will wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you, after this, resisteth faith, he hath truly wandered from the path or rectitude." P: God made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We raised among them twelve chieftains, and God said: Lo! I am with you. If ye establish worship and pay the poor-due, and believe in My messengers and support them, and lend unto God a kindly loan, surely I shall remit your sins, and surely I shall bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Whoso among you disbelieveth after this will go astray from a plain road. S: And certainly God made a covenant with the children of Israel, and We raised up among them twelve chieftains; and God said: Surely I am with you; if you keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and believe in My messengers and assist them and offer to God a goodly gift, I will most certainly cover your evil deeds, and I will most certainly cause you to enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, but whoever disbelieves from among you after that, he indeed shall lose the right way.

005.013 Y: But because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard; they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the message that was sent them, nor wilt thou cease to find them- barring a few - ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds): for God loveth those who are kind. P: And because of their breaking their covenant, We have cursed them and made hard their hearts. They change words from their context and forget a part of that whereof they were admonished. Thou wilt not cease to discover treachery from all save a few of them. But bear with them and pardon them. Lo! God loveth the kindly. S: But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard; they altered the words from their places and they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of; and you shall always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them; so pardon them and turn away; surely God loves those who do good (to others).

005.014 Y: From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the Day of Judgment. And soon will God show them what it is they have done. P: And with those who say: "Lo! we are Christians," We made a covenant, but they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished. Therefore We have stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of their handiwork. S: And with those who say, We are Christians, We made a covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of, therefore We excited among them enmity and hatred to the day of resurrection; and God will inform them of what they did. 005.015 Y: O people of the Book..."for ever, and this is easy to God. 004.170 Y: O Mankind! The Messenger hath come to you in truth from God: believe in him: It is best for you. But if ye reject Faith, to God belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. P: O mankind! The messenger hath come unto you with the Truth from your Lord. Therefore believe; (it is) better for you. But if ye disbelieve, still, lo! unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. God is ever Knower, Wise. S: O people! surely the Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, therefore believe, (it shall be) good for you and If you disbelieve, then surely whatever is in the heavens and the earth is God's; and God is Knowing, Wise. 004.171 Y: O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of God aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of God, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in God and His messengers. Say not "Trinity": desist: it will be better for you: for God is one God: Glory be to Him: (far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is God as a Disposer of affairs. P: O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning God save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of God, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and say not "Three" - Cease! (it is) better for you! - God is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And God is sufficient as Defender. S: O followers of the Book! do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not speak (lies) against God, but (speak) the truth; the Messiah, Isa son of Marium is only a messenger of God and His Word which He communicated to Marium and a spirit from Him; believe therefore in God and His messengers, and say not, Three. Desist, it is better for you; God is only one God; far be It from His glory that He should have a son, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His, and God is sufficient for a Protector. 004.172 Y: Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship God, nor do the angels, those nearest (to God): those who disdain His worship and are arrogant,-He will gather them all together unto Himself to (answer). P: The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto God, nor will the favoured angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He assemble unto Him; S: The Messiah does by no means disdain that he should be a servant of God, nor do the angels who are near to Him, and whoever disdains His service and is proud, He will gather them all together to Himself. 004.173 Y: But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, He will give their (due) rewards,- and more, out of His bounty: But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish with a grievous penalty; Nor will they find, besides God, any to protect or help them. P: Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find for them, against God, any protecting friend or helper. S: Then as for those who believe and do good, He will pay them fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace; and as for those who disdain and are proud, He will chastise them with a painful chastisement. And they shall not find for themselves besides God a guardian or a helper. 004.174 Y: O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord: For We have sent unto you a light (that is) manifest. P: O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have sent down unto you a clear light; S: O people! surely there has come to you manifest proof from your Lord and We have sent to you clear light. 004.175 Y: Then those who believe in God, and hold fast to Him,- soon will He admit them to mercy and grace from Himself, and guide them to Himself by a straight way. P: As for those who believe in God, and hold fast unto Him, them He will cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a straight road. S: Then as for those who believe in God and hold fast by Him, He will cause them to enter into His mercy and grace and guide them to Himself on a right path. 004.176 Y: They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: God directs (thus) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance: If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, Her brother takes her inheritance: If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance (between them): if there are brothers and sisters, (they share), the male having twice the share of the female. Thus doth God make clear to you (His law), lest ye err. And God hath knowledge of all things. P: They ask thee for a pronouncement. Say: God hath pronounced for you concerning distant kindred. If a man die childless and he have a sister, hers is half the heritage, and he would have inherited from her had she died childless. And if there be two sisters, then theirs are two-thirds of the heritage, and if they be brethren, men and women, unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females. God expoundeth unto you, so that ye err not. God is Knower of all things. S: They ask you for a decision of the law. Say: God gives you a decision concerning the person who has neither parents nor offspring; if a man dies (and) he has no son and he has a sister, she shall have half of what he leaves, and he shall be her heir she has no son; but if there be two (sisters), they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves; and if there are brethren, men and women, then the male shall have the like of the portion of two females; God makes clear to you, lest you err; and God knows all things. - Chapter 5: AL-MAEDA (THE TABLE, THE TABLE SPREAD) Total Verses: 120 Revealed At: MADINA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 005.001 Y: O ye who believe! fulfil (all) obligations. Lawful unto you (for food) are all four-footed animals, with the exceptions named: But animals of the chase are forbidden while ye are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb: for God doth command according to His will and plan. P: O ye who believe! Fulfil your indentures. The beast of cattle is made lawful unto you (for food) except that which is announced unto you (herein), game being unlawful when ye are on the pilgrimage. Lo! God ordaineth that which pleaseth Him. S: O you who believe! fulfill the obligations. The cattle quadrupeds are allowed to you except that which is recited to you, not violating the prohibition against game when you are entering upon the performance of the pilgrimage; surely God orders what He desires. 005.002 Y: O ye who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of God, nor of the sacred month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands that mark out such animals, nor the people resorting to the sacred house, seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancour: fear God: for God is strict in punishment. P: O ye who believe! Profane not God's monuments nor the Sacred Month nor the offerings nor the garlands, nor those repairing to the Sacred House, seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord. But when ye have left the sacred territory, then go hunting (if ye will). And let not your hatred of a folk who (once) stopped your going to the inviolable place of worship seduce you to transgress; but help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another unto sin and transgression, but keep your duty to God. Lo! God is severe in punishment. S: O you who believe! do not violate the signs appointed by God nor the sacred month, nor (interfere with) the offerings, nor the sacrificial animals with garlands, nor those going to the sacred house seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord; and when you are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage, then hunt, and let not hatred of a people because they hindered you from the Sacred Masjid incite you to exceed the limits, and help one another in goodness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and aggression; and be careful of (your duty to) God; surely God is severe in requiting (evil). 005.003 Y: Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than God; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, God is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: Forbidden unto you (for food) are carrion and blood and swineflesh, and that which hath been dedicated unto any other than God, and the strangled, and the dead through beating, and the dead through falling from a height, and that which hath been killed by (the goring of) horns, and the devoured of wild beasts, saving that which ye make lawful (by the death-stroke), and that which hath been immolated unto idols. And (forbidden is it) that ye swear by the divining arrows. This is an abomination. This day are those who disbelieve in despair of (ever harming) your religion; so fear them not, fear Me! This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed My favour unto you, and have chosen for you as religion al-Islam. Whoso is forced by hunger, not by will, to sin: (for him) lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of God has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with
O People of the Book! There hath come to you our Messenger, revealing to you much that ye used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There hath come to you from God a (new) light and a perspicuous Book, - P: O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you, expounding unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the Scripture, and forgiving much. Now hath come unto you light from God and plain Scripture. S: O followers of the Book! indeed Our Messenger has come to you making clear to you much of what you concealed of the Book and passing over much; indeed, there has come to you light and a clear Book from God;

005.016 Y: Wherewith God guideth all who seek His good pleasure to ways of peace and safety, and leadeth them out of darkness, by His will, unto the light,- guideth them to a path that is straight. P: Whereby God guideth him who seeketh His good pleasure unto paths of peace. He bringeth them out of darkness unto light by His decree, and guideth them unto a straight path. S: With it God guides him who will follow His pleasure into the ways of safety and brings them out of utter darkness into light by His will and guides them to the right path.

005.017 Y: In blasphemy indeed are those that say that God is Christ the son of Mary. Say: "Who then hath the least power against God, if His will were to destroy Christ the son of Mary, his mother, and all every - one that is on the earth? For to God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between. He createth what He pleaseth. For God hath power over all things." P: They indeed have disbelieved who say: Lo! God is the Messiah, son of Mary. Say: Who then can do aught against God, if He had willed to destroy the Messiah son of Mary, and his mother and everyone on earth? God's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He createth what He will. And God is Able to do all things. S: Certainly they disbelieve who say: Surely, God He is the Messiah, son of Marium. Say: Who then could control anything as against God when He wished to destroy the Messiah son of Marium and his mother and all those on the earth? And God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them; He creates what He pleases; and God has power over all things,

005.018 Y: (Both) the Jews and the Christians say: "We are sons of God, and his beloved." Say: "Why then doth He punish you for your sins? Nay, ye are but men,- of the men he hath created: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and He punisheth whom He pleaseth: and to God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between: and unto Him is the final goal (of all)" P: The Jews and Christians say: We are sons of God and His loved ones. Say: Why then doth He chastise you for your sins? Nay, ye are but mortals of His creating. He forgiveth whom He will, and chastiseth whom He will. God's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and unto Him is the journeying. S: And the Jews and the Christians say: We are the sons of God and His beloved ones. Say: Why does He then chastise you for your faults? Nay, you are mortals from among those whom He has created, He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases; and God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and to Him is the eventual coming.

005.019 Y: O People of the Book! Now hath come unto you, making (things) clear unto you, Our Messenger, after the break in (the series of) our messengers, lest ye should say: "There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner (from evil)": But now hath come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner (from evil). And God hath power over all things. P: O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you to make things plain unto you after an interval (of cessation) of the messengers, lest ye should say: There came not unto us a messenger of cheer nor any warner. Now hath a messenger of cheer and a warner come unto you. God is Able to do all things. S: O followers of the Book! indeed Our Messenger has come to you explaining to you after a cessation of the (mission of the) messengers, lest you say: There came not to us a giver of good news or a warner, so indeed there has come to you a giver of good news and a warner; and God has power over all things.

005.020 Y: Remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Call in remembrance the favour of God unto you, when He produced prophets among you, made you kings, and gave you what He had not given to any other among the peoples." P: And (remember) when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Remember God's favour unto you, how He placed among you prophets, and He made you kings, and gave you that (which) He gave not to any (other) of (His) creatures. S: And when Musa said to his people: O my people! remember the favor of God upon you when He raised prophets among you and made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the nations.

005.021 Y: "O my people! Enter the holy land which God hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin." P: O my people! Go into the holy land which God hath ordained for you. Turn not in flight, for surely ye turn back as losers: S: O my people! enter the holy land which God has prescribed for you and turn not on your backs for then you will turn back losers.

005.022 Y: They said: "O Moses! In this land are a people of exceeding strength: Never shall we enter it until they leave it: if (once) they leave, then shall we enter." P: They said: O Moses! Lo! a giant people (dwell) therein and lo! we go not in till they go forth from thence. When they go forth from thence, then we will enter (not till then). S: They said: O Musa! surely there is a strong race in it, and we will on no account enter it until they go out from it, so if they go out from it, then surely we will enter.

005.023 Y: (But) among (their) God-fearing men were two on whom God had bestowed His grace: They said: "Assault them at the (proper) Gate: when once ye are in, victory will be yours; But on God put your trust if ye have faith." P: Then out spake two of those who feared (their Lord, men) unto whom God had been gracious: Enter in upon them by the gate, for if ye enter by it, lo! ye will be victorious. So put your trust (in God) if ye are indeed believers. S: Two men of those who feared, upon both of whom God had bestowed a favor, said: Enter upon them by the gate, for when you have entered it you shall surely be victorious, and on God should you rely if you are believers.

005.024 Y: They said: "O Moses! while they remain there, never shall we be able to enter, to the end of time. Go thou, and thy Lord, and fight ye two, while we sit here (and watch)." P: They said: O Moses! We will never enter (the land) while they are in it. So go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will sit here. S: They said: O Musa! we shall never enter it so long as they are in it; go therefore you and your Lord, then fight you both surely we will here sit down.

005.025 Y: He said: "O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother: so separate us from this rebellious people!" P: He said: My Lord! I have control of none but myself and my brother, so distinguish between us and the wrong-doing folk. S: He said: My Lord! Surely I have no control (upon any) but my own self and my brother; therefore make a separation between us and the nation of transgressors.

005.026 Y: God said: "Therefore will the land be out of their reach for forty years: In distraction will they wander through the land: But sorrow thou not over these rebellious people." P: (Their Lord) said: For this the land will surely be forbidden them for forty years that they will wander in the earth, bewildered. So grieve not over the wrongdoing folk. S: He said: So it shall surely be forbidden to them for forty years, they shall wander about in the land, therefore do not grieve for the nation of transgressors.

005.027 Y: Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to God): It was accepted from one, but not from the other. Said the latter: "Be sure I will slay thee." "Surely," said the former, "God doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous." P: But recite unto them with truth the tale of the two sons of Adam, how they offered each a sacrifice, and it was accepted from the one of them and it was not accepted from the other. (The one) said: I will surely kill thee. (The other) answered: God accepteth only from those who ward off (evil). S: And relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam with truth when they both offered an offering, but it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other. He said: I will most certainly slay you. (The other) said: God only accepts from those who guard (against evil).

005.028 Y: "If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear God, the cherisher of the worlds." P: Even if thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me, I shall not stretch out my hand against thee to kill thee, lo! I fear God, the Lord of the Worlds. S: If you will stretch forth your hand towards me to slay me, I am not one to stretch forth my hand towards you to slay you surely I fear God, the Lord of the worlds:

005.029 Y: "For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong." P: Lo! I would rather thou shouldst bear the punishment of the sin against me and thine own sin and become one of the owners of the fire. That is the reward of evil-doers. S: Surely I wish that you should bear the sin committed against me and your own sin, and so you would be of the inmates of the fire, and this is the recompense of the unjust.

005.030 Y: The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones. P: But (the other's) mind imposed on him the killing of his brother, so he slew him and became one of the losers. S: Then his mind facilitated to him the slaying of his brother so he slew him; then he became one of the losers.

005.031 Y: Then God sent a raven, who scratched the ground, to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. "Woe is me!" said he; "Was I not even able to be as this raven, and to hide the shame of my brother?" then he became full of regrets- P: Then God sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant. S: Then God sent a crow digging up the earth so that he might show him how he should cover the dead body of his brother. He said: Woe me! Do I lack the strength that I should be like this crow and cover the dead body of my brother? So he became of those who regret."the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

005.004 Y: They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: lawful unto you are (all) things good and pure: and what ye have taught your trained hunting animals (to catch) in the manner directed to you by God: eat what they catch for you, but pronounce the name of God over it: and fear God; for God is swift in taking account. P: They ask thee (O Muhammad) what is made lawful for them. Say: (all) good things are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as hounds are trained, ye teach them that which God taught you; so eat of that which they catch for you and mention God's name upon it, and observe your duty to God. Lo! God is swift to take account. S: They ask you as to what is allowed to them. Say: The good things are allowed to you, and what you have taught the beasts and birds of prey, training them to hunt you teach them of what God has taught you so eat of that which they catch for you and mention the name of God over it; and be careful of (your duty to) God; surely God is swift in reckoning.

005.005 Y: This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time,- when ye give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues if any one rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good). P: This day are (all) good things made lawful for you. The food of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you (lawful for you) when ye give them their marriage portions and live with them in honour, not in fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines. Whoso denieth the faith, his work is vain and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter. S: This day (all) the good things are allowed to you; and the food of those who have been given the Book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them; and the chaste from among the believing women and the chaste from among those who have been given the Book before you (are lawful for you); when you have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.

005.006 Y: O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands, God doth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete his favour to you, that ye may be grateful. P: O ye who believe! When ye rise up for prayer, wash you faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and lightly rub your heads and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if ye are unclean, purify yourselves. And if ye are sick or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have had contact with women, and ye find not water, then go to clean, high ground and rub your faces and your hands with some of it. God would not place a burden on you, but He would purify you and would perfect His grace upon you, that ye may give thanks. S: O you who believe! when you rise up to prayer, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles; and if you are under an obligation to perform a total ablution, then wash (yourselves) and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or you have touched the women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith, God does not desire to put on you any difficulty, but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favor on you, so that you may be grateful.

005.007 Y: And call in remembrance the favour of God unto you, and His covenant, which He ratified with you, when ye said: "We hear and we obey": And fear God, for God knoweth well the secrets of your hearts. P: Remember God's grace upon you and His covenant by which He bound you when ye said: We hear and we obey; And keep your duty to God. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men). S: And remember the favor of God on you and His covenant with which He bound you firmly, when you said: We have heard and we obey, and be careful of (your duty to) God, surely God knows what is in the breasts.

005.008 Y: O ye who believe! stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. P: O ye who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for God in equity, and let not hatred of any people seduce you that ye deal not justly. Deal justly, that is nearer to your duty. Observe your duty to God. Lo! God is Informed of what ye do. S: O you who believe! Be upright for God, bearers of witness with justice, and let not hatred of a people incite you not to act equitably; act equitably, that is nearer to piety, and he careful of (your duty to) God; surely God is Aware of what you do.

005.009 Y: To those who believe and do deeds of righteousness hath God promised forgiveness and a great reward. P: God hath promised those who believe and do good works: Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward. S: God has promised to those who believe and do good deeds (that) they shall have forgiveness and a mighty reward.

005.010 Y: Those who reject faith and deny our signs will be companions of Hell-fire. P: And they who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, such are rightful owners of hell. S: And (as for) those who disbelieve and reject our communications, these are the companions of the name.

005.011 Y: O ye who believe! Call in remembrance the favour of God unto you when certain men formed the design to stretch out their hands against you, but (God) held back their hands from you: so fear God. And on God let believers put (all) their trust. P: O ye who believe! Remember God's favour unto you, how a people were minded to stretch out their hands against you but He withheld their hands from you; and keep your duty to God. In God let believers put their trust. S: O you who believe! remember God's favor on you when a people had determined to stretch forth their hands towards you, but He withheld their hands from you, and be careful of (your duty to) God; and on God let the believers rely.

005.012 Y: God did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we appointed twelve captains among them. And God said: "I am with you: if ye (but) establish regular prayers, practise regular charity, believe in my messengers, honour and assist them, and loan to God a beautiful loan, verily I will wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you, after this, resisteth faith, he hath truly wandered from the path or rectitude." P: God made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We raised among them twelve chieftains, and God said: Lo! I am with you. If ye establish worship and pay the poor-due, and believe in My messengers and support them, and lend unto God a kindly loan, surely I shall remit your sins, and surely I shall bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Whoso among you disbelieveth after this will go astray from a plain road. S: And certainly God made a covenant with the children of Israel, and We raised up among them twelve chieftains; and God said: Surely I am with you; if you keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and believe in My messengers and assist them and offer to God a goodly gift, I will most certainly cover your evil deeds, and I will most certainly cause you to enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, but whoever disbelieves from among you after that, he indeed shall lose the right way.

005.013 Y: But because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard; they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the message that was sent them, nor wilt thou cease to find them- barring a few - ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds): for God loveth those who are kind. P: And because of their breaking their covenant, We have cursed them and made hard their hearts. They change words from their context and forget a part of that whereof they were admonished. Thou wilt not cease to discover treachery from all save a few of them. But bear with them and pardon them. Lo! God loveth the kindly. S: But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard; they altered the words from their places and they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of; and you shall always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them; so pardon them and turn away; surely God loves those who do good (to others).

005.014 Y: From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the Day of Judgment. And soon will God show them what it is they have done. P: And with those who say: "Lo! we are Christians," We made a covenant, but they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished. Therefore We have stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of their handiwork. S: And with those who say, We are Christians, We made a covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of, therefore We excited among them enmity and hatred to the day of resurrection; and God will inform them of what they did.
O People of the Scripture! Our Messenger has come to you, revealing much that you used to hide in the Book and passing over much that is now unnecessary. There has come to you from God a new light and a clear Book. God guides those who seek His pleasure to ways of peace and safety, leading them out of darkness into light and guiding them to a straight path.

Those who say that God is Christ, the son of Mary, are in blasphemy. Say: 'Who then has the least power against God if He were to destroy Christ, his mother, and everyone on earth? To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between. He creates what He pleases, and God has power over all things.'

The Jews and Christians say: 'We are sons of God and His beloved.' Say: 'Why then does He punish you for your sins? You are but mortals of His creation. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between, and to Him is the final goal.'

O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making things clear after a break in the series of messengers, lest you say: 'No bringer of glad tidings and no warner came to us.' But now a bringer of glad tidings and a warner has come to you, and God has power over all things.

Remember when Moses said to his people: 'O my people! Remember God's favor upon you when He raised prophets among you, made you kings, and gave you what He had not given to any other people. Enter the holy land which God has assigned to you and do not turn back, for then you will be overthrown.'

They said: 'O Moses! In this land are people of great strength. We will not enter until they leave. If they leave, then we will enter.' Two men who feared God and upon whom God had bestowed His grace said: 'Enter upon them by the gate, for if you enter, you will be victorious. Put your trust in God if you are believers.'

They said: 'O Moses! We will never enter while they are there. Go, you and your Lord, and fight. We will sit here.' Moses said: 'O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother. Separate us from this rebellious people.' God said: 'The land will be forbidden to them for forty years. They will wander in the land. Do not grieve over the rebellious people.'

Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. They each presented a sacrifice to God. It was accepted from one but not from the other. The latter said: 'I will surely kill you.' The former said: 'God accepts only from the righteous. If you stretch your hand to kill me, I will not stretch my hand to kill you. I fear God, the Lord of the worlds. I intend to let you draw on yourself my sin as well as yours, for you will be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong.'

The selfish soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother. He murdered him and became one of the lost ones. Then God sent a raven to scratch the ground and show him how to hide the shame of his brother. He said: 'Woe is me! Was I not even able to be as this raven and hide the shame of my brother?' Then he became full of regrets."t show him how he should cover the dead body of his brother. He said: Woe me! do I lack the strength that I should be like this crow and cover the dead body of my brother? So he became of those who regret.

005.032 Y: On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land. P: For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came unto them of old with clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty), but afterwards lo! many of them became prodigals in the earth. S: For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel that whoever slays a soul, unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men; and certainly Our messengers came to them with clear arguments, but even after that many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land.

005.033 Y: The punishment of those who wage war against God and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter; P: The only reward of those who make war upon God and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom; S: The punishment of those who wage war against God and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement,

005.034 Y: Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: in that case, know that God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: Save those who repent before ye overpower them. For know that God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: Except those who repent before you have them in your power; so know that God is Forgiving, Merciful.

005.035 Y: O ye who believe! Do your duty to God, seek the means of approach unto Him, and strive with might and main in his cause: that ye may prosper. P: O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to God, and seek the way of approach unto Him, and strive in His way in order that ye may succeed. S: O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) God and seek means of nearness to Him and strive hard in His way that you may be successful.

005.036 Y: As to those who reject Faith,- if they had everything on earth, and twice repeated, to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted of them, theirs would be a grievous penalty. P: As for those who disbelieve, lo! if all that is in the earth were theirs, and as much again therewith, to ransom them from the doom on the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them. Theirs will be a painful doom. S: Surely (as for) those who disbelieve, even if they had what is in the earth, all of it, and the like of it with it, that they might ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the day of resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them, and they shall have a painful punishment.

005.037 Y: Their wish will be to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom: their penalty will be one that endures. P: They will wish to come forth from the Fire, but they will not come forth from it. Theirs will be a lasting doom. S: They would desire to go forth from the fire, and they shall not go forth from it, and they shall have a lasting punishment.

005.038 Y: As to the thief, Male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from God, for their crime: and God is Exalted in power. P: As for the thief, both male and female, cut off their hands. It is the reward of their own deeds, an exemplary punishment from God. God is Mighty, Wise. S: And (as for) the man who steals and the woman who steals, cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have earned, an exemplary punishment from God; and God is Mighty, Wise.

005.039 Y: But if the thief repents after his crime, and amends his conduct, God turneth to him in forgiveness; for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: But whoso repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth, lo! God will relent toward him. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: But whoever repents after his iniquity and reforms (himself), then surely God will turn to him (mercifully); surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

005.040 Y: Knowest thou not that to God (alone) belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punisheth whom He pleaseth, and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth: and God hath power over all things. P: Knowest thou not that unto God belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth? He punisheth whom He will, and forgiveth whom He will. God is Able to do all things. S: Do you not know that God His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He chastises whom He pleases; and forgives whom He pleases and God has power over all things.

005.041 Y: O Messenger! let not those grieve thee, who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say "We believe" with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews,- men who will listen to any lie,- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, "If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!" If any one's trial is intended by God, thou hast no authority in the least for him against God. For such - it is not God's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment. P: O Messenger! Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race to disbelief, of such as say with their mouths: "We believe," but their hearts believe not, and of the Jews: listeners for the sake of falsehood, listeners on behalf of other folk who come not unto thee, changing words from their context and saying: If this be given unto you, receive it, but if this be not given unto you, then beware! He whom God doometh unto sin, thou (by thine efforts) wilt avail him naught against God. Those are they for whom the Will of God is that He cleanse not their hearts. Theirs in the world will be ignominy, and in the Hereafter an awful doom; S: O Messenger! let not those grieve you who strive together in hastening to unbelief from among those who say with their mouths: We believe, and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews; they are listeners for the sake of a lie, listeners for another people who have not come to you; they alter the words from their places, saying: If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, be cautious; and as for him whose temptation God desires, you cannot control anything for him with God. Those are they for whom God does not desire that He should purify their hearts; they shall have disgrace in this world, and they shall have a grievous chastisement in the hereafter.

005.042 Y: (They are fond of) listening to falsehood, of devouring anything forbidden. If they do come to thee, either judge between them, or decline to interfere. If thou decline, they cannot hurt thee in the least. If thou judge, judge in equity between them. For God loveth those who judge in equity. P: Listeners for the sake of falsehood! Greedy for illicit gain! If then they have recourse unto thee (Muhammad) judge between them or disclaim jurisdiction. If thou disclaimest jurisdiction, then they cannot harm thee at all. But if thou judgest, judge between them with equity. Lo! God loveth the equitable. S: (They are) listeners of a lie, devourers of what is forbidden; therefore if they come to you, judge between them or turn aside from them, and if you turn aside from them, they shall not harm you in any way; and if you judge, judge between them with equity; surely God loves those who judge equitably.

005.043 Y: But why do they come to thee for decision, when they have (their own) law before them?- therein is the (plain) command of God; yet even after that, they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith. P: How come they unto thee for judgment when they have the Torah, wherein God hath delivered judgment (for them)? Yet even after that they turn away. Such (folk) are not believers. S: And how do they make you a judge and they have the Taurat wherein is God's judgment? Yet they turn back after that, and these are not the believers.

005.044 Y: It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to God's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of God's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers. P: Lo! We did reveal the Torah, wherein is guidance and a light, by which the prophets who surrendered (unto God) judged the Jews, and the rabbis and the priests (judged) by such of God's Scripture as they were bidden to observe, and thereunto were they witnesses. So fear not mankind, but fear Me. And My revelations for a little gain. Whoso judgeth not by that which God hath revealed: such are disbelievers. S: Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and light; with it the prophets who submitted themselves (to God) judged (matters) for those who were Jews, and the masters of Divine knowledge and the doctors, because they were required to guard (part) of the Book of God, and they were witnesses thereof; therefore fear not the people and fear Me, and do not take a small price for My communications; and whoever did not judge by what God revealed, those are they that are the unbelievers.

005.045 Y: We ordained therein for them: "Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wound for wound.""t show him how he should cover the dead body of his brother. He said: Woe me! Do I lack the strength that I should be like this crow and cover the dead body of my brother? So he became of those who regret. 

On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.

For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever kills a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came unto them of old with clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty), but afterwards lo! many of them became prodigals in the earth.

For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel that whoever slays a soul, unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men; and certainly Our messengers came to them with clear arguments, but even after that many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land.

The punishment of those who wage war against God and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.

The only reward of those who make war upon God and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom.

The punishment of those who wage war against God and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement.

Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: in that case, know that God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Save those who repent before ye overpower them. For know that God is Forgiving, Merciful.

Except those who repent before you have them in your power; so know that God is Forgiving, Merciful.

O ye who believe! Do your duty to God, seek the means of approach unto Him, and strive with might and main in his cause: that ye may prosper.

O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to God, and seek the way of approach unto Him, and strive in His way in order that ye may succeed.

O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) God and seek means of nearness to Him and strive hard in His way that you may be successful.

As to those who reject Faith,- if they had everything on earth, and twice repeated, to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted of them, theirs would be a grievous penalty.

As for those who disbelieve, lo! if all that is in the earth were theirs, and as much again therewith, to ransom them from the doom on the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them. Theirs will be a painful doom.

Surely (as for) those who disbelieve, even if they had what is in the earth, all of it, and the like of it with it, that they might ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the day of resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them, and they shall have a painful punishment.

Their wish will be to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom: their penalty will be one that endures.

They will wish to come forth from the Fire, but they will not come forth from it. Theirs will be a lasting doom.

They would desire to go forth from the fire, and they shall not go forth from it, and they shall have a lasting punishment.

As to the thief, Male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from God, for their crime: and God is Exalted in power.

As for the thief, both male and female, cut off their hands. It is the reward of their own deeds, an exemplary punishment from God. God is Mighty, Wise.

And (as for) the man who steals and the woman who steals, cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have earned, an exemplary punishment from God; and God is Mighty, Wise.

But if the thief repents after his crime, and amends his conduct, God turneth to him in forgiveness; for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

But whoso repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth, lo! God will relent toward him. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful.

But whoever repents after his iniquity and reforms (himself), then surely God will turn to him (mercifully); surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

Knowest thou not that to God (alone) belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punisheth whom He pleaseth, and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth: and God hath power over all things.

Knowest thou not that unto God belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth? He punisheth whom He will, and forgiveth whom He will. God is Able to do all things.

Do you not know that God His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He chastises whom He pleases; and forgives whom He pleases and God has power over all things.

O Messenger! let not those grieve you who strive together in hastening to unbelief from among those who say with their mouths: We believe, and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews; they are listeners for the sake of a lie, listeners for another people who have not come to you; they alter the words from their places, saying: If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, be cautious; and as for him whose temptation God desires, you cannot control anything for him with God.

We ordained therein for them: "Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wound for wound."nds equal for equal." But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself. And if any fail to judge by what God hath revealed, they are wrong-doers.

We prescribed for them: Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and for wounds retaliation. But whoso forgoeth it in the way of charity, it shall be expiation for him. Whoso judgeth not by what God hath revealed: such are wrong-doers.

We revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance and light, by which the prophets who surrendered to God judged the Jews, and the rabbis and priests judged by God's Scripture. Fear not mankind, but fear Me. Whoso judgeth not by what God hath revealed: such are disbelievers.

We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him. We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear God.

Let the people of the Gospel judge by what God hath revealed therein. Whoso judgeth not by what God hath revealed: such are evil-livers.

We revealed to you the Book with the truth, confirming what is before it of the Book and a guardian over it. Judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their desires. For each, We have appointed a law and a way. Strive with one another to hasten to virtuous deeds; to God is your return, and He will let you know that in which you differed.

Judge between them by what God hath revealed, and follow not their desires. If they turn away, know that God desires to afflict them on account of some of their faults; many of the people are transgressors.

Do they seek after a judgment of ignorance? Who is better than God for judgment to a people who are sure?

O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is one of them. God guideth not wrongdoing folk.

Those in whose hearts is a disease race toward them, saying: We fear lest a change of fortune befall us. It may happen that God will vouchsafe the victory, or a commandment from His presence. Then will they repent of their secret thoughts.

And those who believe will say: Are these they who swore by God their most binding oaths that they were surely with you? Their works have failed, and they have become the losers.

O ye who believe! Whoso of you becometh a renegade from his religion, God will bring a people whom He loveth and who love Him, humble toward believers, stern toward disbelievers, striving in the way of God, and fearing not the blame of any blamer. Such is the grace of God which He giveth unto whom He will. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.

Your real friends are God, His Messenger, and the believers who establish regular prayers and regular charity, and they bow down humbly in worship.

Whoso taketh God and His messenger and those who believe for guardian, the party of God, they are the victorious.

O ye who believe! Take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport, whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear God if ye have faith indeed.

When ye proclaim your call to prayer they take it as mockery and sport; that is because they are a people without understanding."Say: 'O People of the Book! Do you disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in God, and the revelation that has come to us and that which came before us, and that most of you are rebellious and disobedient?' Say: 'Shall I point out to you something much worse than this, as judged by the treatment it received from God? Those who incurred the curse of God and His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped evil; these are worse in rank and far more astray from the even path!' When they come to you, they say: 'We believe'; but in fact, they enter with a mind against Faith, and they go out with the same, but God knows fully all that they hide. Many of them you see racing each other in sin and rancor, and their eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things that they do. Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of Law forbid them from their habit of uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden? Evil indeed are their works. The Jews say: 'God's hand is tied up.' Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the blasphemy they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched: He gives and spends as He pleases. But the revelation that comes to you from God increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them, we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, God extinguishes it; but they strive to do mischief on earth. And God loves not those who do mischief. If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We should indeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to gardens of bliss. If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed to them from their Lord, they would surely have been nourished from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them, there are people who are moderate, but many of them are of evil conduct. O Messenger! Proclaim the message which has been sent to you from your Lord. If you did not, you would not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission. And God will defend you from men who mean mischief. For God guides not those who reject Faith. Say: 'O People of the Book! You have no ground to stand upon unless you stand fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord.' It is the revelation that comes to you from your Lord that increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But do not grieve over these people without Faith. Those who believe in the Qur'an, those who follow the Jewish scriptures, and the Sabians and the Christians, any who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Every time there came to them a messenger with what they themselves desired not, some of these they called impostors, and some they slew. They thought there would be no trial or punishment; so they became blind and deaf; yet God in mercy turned to them; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. But God sees well all that they do. They do blaspheme who say: 'God is Christ the son of Mary.' But said Christ: 'O Children of Israel! Worship God, my Lord and your Lord.' Whoever joins other gods with God, God will forbid him the garden, and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help. They do blaspheme who say: 'God is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One God. If they desist not from their word of blasphemy, verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers.
He pleaseth: and God hath power over all things. Knowest thou not that unto God belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth? He punisheth whom He will, and forgiveth whom He will. God is Able to do all things. Do you not know that God His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He chastises whom He pleases; and forgives whom He pleases and God has power over all things.

But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself. And if any fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (No better than) wrong-doers. And We prescribed for them therein: The life for the life, and the eye for the eye, and the nose for the nose, and the ear for the ear, and the tooth for the tooth, and for wounds retaliation. But whoso forgoeth it (in the way of charity) it shall be expiation for him. Whoso judgeth not by that which God hath revealed: such are wrong-doers. And We prescribed to them in it that life is for life, and eye for eye, and nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth, and (that there is) reprisal in wounds; but he who foregoes it, it shall be an expiation for him; and whoever did not judge by what God revealed, those are they that are the unjust.

And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear God. And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil). And We sent after them in their footsteps Isa, son of Marium, verifying what was before him of the Taurat and We gave him the Injeel in which was guidance and light, and verifying what was before it of Taurat and a guidance and an admonition for those who guard (against evil).

Let the people of the Gospel judge by what God hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel. Let the People of the Gospel judge by that which God hath revealed therein. Whoso judgeth not by that which God hath revealed: such are evil-livers. And the followers of the Injeel should have judged by what God revealed in it; and whoever did not judge by what God revealed, those are they that are the transgressors.

To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what God hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to God; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute; And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture with the truth, confirming whatever Scripture was before it, and a watcher over it. So judge between them by that which God hath revealed, and follow not their desires away from the truth which hath come unto thee. For each We have appointed a divine law and a traced-out way. Had God willed He could have made you one community. But that He may try you by that which He hath given you (He hath made you as ye are). So vie one with another in good works. Unto God ye will all return, and He will then inform you of that wherein ye differ. And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, verifying what is before it of the Book and a guardian over it, therefore judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their low desires (to turn away) from the truth that has come to you; for every one of you did We appoint a law and a way, and if God had pleased He would have made you (all) a single people, but that He might try you in what He gave you, therefore strive with one another to hasten to virtuous deeds; to God is your return, of all (of you), so He will let you know that in which you differed;

And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what God hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which God hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is God's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious. So judge between them by that which God hath revealed, and follow not their desires, but beware of them lest they seduce thee from some part of that which God hath revealed unto thee. And if they turn away, then know that God's Will is to smite them for some sin of theirs. Lo! many of mankind are evil-livers. And that you should judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their low desires, and be cautious of them, lest they seduce you from part of what God has revealed to you; but if they turn back, then know that God desires to afflict them on account of some of their faults; and most surely many of the people are transgressors.

Do they then seek after a judgment of (the days of) ignorance? But who, for a people whose faith is assured, can give better judgment than God? Is it a judgment of the time of (pagan) ignorance that they are seeking? Who is better than God for judgment to a people who have certainty (in their belief)? Is it then the judgment of (the times of) ignorance that they desire? And who is better than God to judge for a people who are sure?

O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily God guideth not a people unjust. O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is (one) of them. Lo! God guideth not wrongdoing folk. O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely God does not guide the unjust people.

Those in whose hearts is a disease - thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them, saying: "We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster." Ah! perhaps God will give (thee) victory, or a decision according to His will. Then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harboured in their hearts. And thou seest those in whose heart is a disease race toward them, saying: We fear lest a change of fortune befall us. And it may happen that God will vouchsafe (unto thee) the victory, or a commandment from His presence. Then will they repent them of their secret thoughts. But you will see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening towards them, saying: We fear lest a calamity should befall us; but it may be that God will bring the victory or a punishment from Himself, so that they shall be regretting on account of what they hid in their souls.

And those who believe will say: "Are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by God, that they were with you?" All that they do will be in vain, and they will fall into (nothing but) ruin. Then will the believers say (unto the people of the Scripture): are these they who swore by God their most binding oaths that they were surely with you? Their works have failed, and they have become the losers. And those who believe will say: Are these they who swore by God with the most forcible of their oaths that they were most surely with you? Their deeds shall go for nothing, so they shall become losers.

O ye who believe! if any from among you turn back from his Faith, soon will God produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him,- lowly with the believers, mighty against the rejecters, fighting in the way of God, and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault. That is the grace of God, which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth. And God encompasseth all, and He knoweth all things. O ye who believe! Whoso of you becometh a renegade from his religion, (know that in his stead) God will bring a people whom He loveth and who love Him, humble toward believers, stern toward disbelievers, striving in the way of God, and fearing not the blame of any blamer. Such is the grace of God which He giveth unto whom He will. God is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. O you who believe! whoever from among you turns back from his religion, then God will bring a people, He shall love them and they shall love Him, lowly before the believers, mighty against the unbelievers, they shall strive hard in God's way and shall not fear the censure of any censurer; this is God's Face, He gives it to whom He pleases, and God is Ample-giving, Knowing.

Your (real) friends are (no less than) God, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity, and they bow down humbly (in worship). Your guardian can be only God; and His messenger and those who believe, who establish worship and pay the poordue, and bow down (in prayer). Only God is your Vali and His Messenger and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow.

As to those who turn (for friendship) to God, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- it is the fellowship of God that must certainly triumph. And whoso taketh God and His messenger and those who believe for guardian (will know that), lo! the party of God, they are the victorious. And whoever takes God and His messenger and those who believe for a guardian, then surely the party of God are they that shall be triumphant.

O ye who believe! take not for friends and protectors those who take your religion for a mockery or sport,- whether among those who received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye God, if ye have faith (indeed). O Ye who believe! Choose not for guardians such of those who received the Scripture before you, and of the disbelievers, as make a jest and sport of your religion. But keep your duty to God if ye are true believers. O you who believe! do not take for guardians those who take your religion for a mockery and a joke, from among those who were given the Book before you and the unbelievers; and be careful of (your duty to) God if you are believers.

When ye proclaim your call to prayer they take it (but) as mockery and sport; that is because they are a people without understanding. And when ye call to prayer they take it for a jest and sport. That is because they are a folk who understand not. And when you call to prayer they make it a mockery and a joke; this is because they are a people who do not understand."They surely disbelieve who say: "God is the third of three"; when there is no God save the One God. If they desist not from so saying, a painful doom will fall on those who disbelieve. Why do they not turn to God and seek His forgiveness? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than a messenger; many were the messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both had to eat their daily food. See how God makes His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth! Say: "Will you worship, besides God, something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But God, He it is that hears and knows all things." Say: "O people of the Book! Exceed not in your religion the bounds of what is proper, trespassing beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by, who misled many, and strayed from the even way." Curses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected Faith, by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary, because they disobeyed and persisted in excesses. They did not forbid one another the iniquities they committed: evil indeed were the deeds they did. You see many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers. Evil indeed are the works which their souls have sent forward before them, that God's wrath is on them, and in torment will they abide. If only they had believed in God, in the Prophet, and in what has been revealed to him, they would not have taken them for friends and protectors, but most of them are rebellious wrong-doers. Strongest among men in enmity to the believers are the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers are those who say, "We are Christians": because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant. When they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflowing with tears, for they recognize the truth: they pray: "Our Lord! We believe; write us down among the witnesses." What cause can we have not to believe in God and the truth which has come to us, seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous? And for this their prayer, God rewarded them with gardens, with rivers flowing underneath, their eternal home. Such is the recompense of those who do good. But those who reject Faith and belie our Signs, they shall be companions of Hell-fire. O you who believe! Make not unlawful the good things which God has made lawful for you, but commit no excess: for God loves not those given to excess. Eat of the things which God has provided for you, lawful and good; but fear God, in Whom you believe. God will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths, but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths: for expiation, feed ten indigent persons, on a scale of the average for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths you have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus does God make clear to you His signs, that you may be grateful. O you who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, dedication of stones, and divination by arrows, are an abomination of Satan's handwork: eschew such abomination, that you may prosper. Satan's plan is to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of God, and from prayer: will you not then abstain?"Obey God, and obey the Messenger, and beware (of evil): if you turn back, know that it is Our Messenger's duty to proclaim (the message) in the clearest manner. On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, there is no blame for what they ate (in the past), when they guard themselves from evil, and believe, and do good deeds. For God loves those who do good. O you who believe! God will surely try you in the matter of game within reach of your hands and lances, that He may test who fears Him unseen. Any who transgress thereafter will have a grievous penalty. O you who believe! Kill not game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. If any of you does so intentionally, the compensation is an offering brought to the Ka'ba, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or by way of atonement, the feeding of the indigent; or its equivalent in fasts. God forgives what is past, but for repetition, God will exact the penalty. Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food, but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game as long as you are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. God made the Ka'ba, the Sacred House, an asylum of security for men, as also the Sacred Months, the animals for offerings, and the garlands that mark them. Know that God is strict in punishment and Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. The Messenger's duty is but to proclaim the message. God knows all that you reveal and conceal. Say: 'Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good, even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle you; so fear God, O you that understand, that you may prosper.' O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. Some people before you did ask such questions and lost their faith. It was not God who instituted superstitions like those of a slit-ear she-camel or a she-camel let loose for free pasture, or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals, or stallion-camels freed from work. It is blasphemers who invent a lie against God; most of them lack wisdom. When it is said to them: 'Come to what God has revealed; come to the Messenger,' they say: 'Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following.' What! Even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance? O you who believe! Guard your own souls: if you follow right guidance, no hurt can come to you from those who stray. The goal of you all is to God: He will show you the truth of all that you do. O you who believe! When death approaches any of you, take witnesses among yourselves when making bequests—two just men of your own brotherhood or others from outside if you are journeying through the earth, and the chance of death befalls you. If you doubt their truth, detain them both after prayer, and let them both swear by God: 'We wish not in this for any worldly gain, even though the beneficiary be our near relation: we shall hide not the evidence before God: if we do, then behold! the sin be upon us!'"Say: "O People of the Book! Do you disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in God, and the revelation that has come to us and that which came before us, and that most of you are rebellious and disobedient?" Say: "Shall I point out to you something much worse than this, as judged by the treatment it received from God? Those who incurred the curse of God and His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped evil; these are worse in rank and far more astray from the even path!" When they come to you, they say: "We believe"; but in fact, they enter with a mind against Faith, and they go out with the same, but God knows fully all that they hide. Many of them you see racing each other in sin and rancor, and their eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things that they do. Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of Law forbid them from their habit of uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden? Evil indeed are their works. The Jews say: "God's hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the blasphemy they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched: He gives and spends as He pleases. But the revelation that comes to you from God increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them, we have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, God extinguishes it; but they strive to do mischief on earth. And God loves not those who do mischief. If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We should indeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to gardens of bliss. If only they had stood fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord, they would have enjoyed happiness from every side. There is from among them a party on the right course, but many of them follow a course that is evil. O Messenger! Proclaim the message which has been sent to you from your Lord. If you did not, you would not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission. And God will defend you from men who mean mischief. For God guides not those who reject Faith. Say: "O People of the Book! You have no ground to stand upon unless you stand fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord." It is the revelation that comes to you from your Lord that increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But do not sorrow over these people without Faith. Those who believe in the Qur'an, those who follow the Jewish scriptures, the Sabians, and the Christians, any who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Every time a messenger came to them with what they themselves desired not, some they called impostors, and some they slew. They thought there would be no trial or punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Yet God, in mercy, turned to them. Yet again, many of them became blind and deaf. But God sees well all that they do. They do blaspheme who say: "God is Christ the son of Mary." But said Christ: "O Children of Israel! Worship God, my Lord and your Lord." Whoever joins other gods with God, God will forbid him the garden, and the Fire will be his abode. There will be no one to help the wrong-doers. They do blaspheme who say: "God is one of three in a Trinity." For there is no god except One God. If they do not desist from their word of blasphemy, a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers.They surely disbelieve who say: "God is the third of three"; when there is no God save the One God. If they desist not from so saying, a painful doom will fall on those who disbelieve. Why do they not turn to God and seek His forgiveness? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than a messenger; many were the messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both had to eat their daily food. See how God makes His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth! Say: "Will you worship, besides God, something which has no power either to harm or benefit you?

Satan's plan is to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of God, and from prayer: will you not then abstain?"Shaitan only desires to cause enmity and hatred among you through intoxicants and games of chance, and to turn you from the remembrance of God and from His worship. Will you then desist? Obey God and the Messenger, and beware of evil. If you turn back, know that the Messenger's duty is only to proclaim the message clearly. Those who believe and do righteous deeds are not blamed for what they ate in the past, as long as they guard themselves from evil and continue to do good. God loves those who do good.

God will test you with game within reach of your hands and lances to see who fears Him unseen. Those who transgress will face a grievous penalty. Do not kill game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. If anyone does so intentionally, the compensation is an offering brought to the Ka'ba, or feeding the indigent, or fasting. God forgives what is past, but for repetition, God will exact the penalty. Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food, but forbidden is the pursuit of land-game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. Fear God, to Whom you shall be gathered back.

God made the Ka'ba, the Sacred House, an asylum of security for men, as also the Sacred Months, the animals for offerings, and the garlands that mark them. This is so you may know that God has knowledge of what is in the heavens and on earth. God is strict in punishment but also Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. The Messenger's duty is only to proclaim the message. God knows what you reveal and what you conceal.

Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good, even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle you. Fear God, O you that understand, so you may prosper. Do not ask questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. Some people before you asked such questions and lost their faith. God has not instituted superstitions like a slit-ear she-camel or a she-camel let loose for free pasture. It is blasphemers who invent lies against God.

When it is said to them, "Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger," they say, "Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following," even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance. Guard your own souls; if you follow right guidance, no harm can come to you from those who stray. To God is your return, and He will show you the truth of all that you do.

When death approaches any of you, take witnesses among yourselves when making bequests—two just men of your own or others from outside if you are journeying and death befalls you. If you doubt their truth, detain them both after prayer and let them swear by God that they wish not for any worldly gain, even if the beneficiary is a near relation. They shall not hide the evidence before God, or the sin will be upon them.""shall be made to swear by God (saying): We will not take a bribe, even though it were (on behalf of) a near kinsman nor will we hide the testimony of God, for then indeed we should be of the sinful. O you who believe! call to witness between you when death draws nigh to one of you, at the time of making the will, two just persons from among you, or two others from among others than you, if you are travelling in the land and the calamity of death befalls you; the two (witnesses) you should detain after the prayer; then if you doubt (them), they shall both swear by God, (saying): We will not take for it a price, though there be a relative, and we will not hide the testimony of God for then certainly we should be among the sinners. But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury), let two others stand forth in their places,- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right: let them swear by God: 'We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed (beyond the truth): if we did, behold! the wrong be upon us!' But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit (the suspicion of) sin, let two others take their place of those nearly concerned, and let them swear by God, (saying): Verily our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed (the bounds of duty), for them indeed we should be of the evil-doers. Then if it becomes known that they both have been guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up in their place from among those who have a claim against them, the two nearest in kin; so they two should swear by God: Certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not exceeded the limit, for then most surely we should be of the unjust. That is most suitable: that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape, or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths. But fear God, and listen (to His counsel): for God guideth not a rebellious people. Thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after their oaths the oaths (of others) will be taken. So be mindful of your duty (to God) and hearken. God guideth not the froward folk. One day will God gather the messengers together, and ask: 'What was the response ye received (from men to your teaching)?' They will say: 'We have no knowledge: it is Thou Who knowest in full all that is hidden.' In the day when God gathereth together the messengers, and saith: What was your response (from mankind)? they say: We have no knowledge. Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden. On the day when God will assemble the messengers, then say: What answer were you given? They shall say: We have no knowledge, surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things. Then will God say: 'O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the holy spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel and behold! thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and thou breathest into it and it becometh a bird by My leave, and thou healest those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And behold! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the clear Signs, and the unbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evident magic.' When God saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour unto thee and unto thy mother; how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit, so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity; and how I taught thee the Scripture and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of a bird by My permission, and didst blow upon it and it was a bird by My permission, and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My permission; and how thou didst raise the dead by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from (harming) thee when thou camest unto them with clear proofs, and those of them who disbelieved exclaimed: This is naught else than mere magic. When God will say: O Isa son of Marium! Remember My favor on you and on your mother, when I strengthened you I with the holy Spirit, you spoke to the people in the cradle and I when of old age, and when I taught you the Book and the wisdom and the Taurat and the Injeel; and when you determined out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I withheld the children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments, but those who disbelieved among them said: This is nothing but clear enchantment. 'And behold! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and Mine Messenger: they said, 'We have faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to God as Muslims'. And when I inspired the disciples, (saying): Believe in Me and in My messenger, they said: We believe. Bear witness that we have surrendered (unto Thee) 'we are muslims'. And when I revealed to the disciples, saying, Believe in Me and My messenger, they said: We believe and bear witness that we submit (ourselves). Behold! the disciples, said: 'O Jesus the son of Mary! can thy Lord send down to us a table set (with viands) from heaven?' Said Jesus: 'Fear God, if ye have faith.' When the disciples said: O Jesus, son of Mary! Is thy Lord able to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said: Observe your duty to God, if ye are true believers. When the disciples said: O Isa son of Marium! will your Lord consent to send down to us food from heaven? He said: Be careful of (your duty to) God if you are believers. They said: 'We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts, and to know that thou hast indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may be witnesses to the miracle.' (They said:) We wish to eat thereof, that we may satisfy our hearts and know that thou hast spoken truth to us, and that thereof we may be witnesses. They said: We desire that we should eat of it and that our hearts should be at rest, and that we may know that you have indeed spoken the truth to us and that we may be of the witnesses to it. Said Jesus the son of Mary: 'O God our Lord! Send us from heaven a table set (with viands), that there may be for us - for the first and the last of us - a solemn festival and a sign from thee; and provide for our sustenance, for thou art the best Sustainer (of our needs).' Jesus, son of Mary, said: O God, Lord of us! Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers. Isa the son of Marium said: O God, our Lord! send down to us food from heaven which should be to us an ever-recurring happiness, to the first of us and to the last of us, and a sign from Thee, and grant us means of subsistence, and Thou art the best of the Providers. God said: 'I will send it down unto you: But if any of you after that resisteth faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one among all the peoples.' God said: Lo! I send it down for you. And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward, him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any of (My) creatures. God said: Surely I will send it down to you, but whoever shall disbelieve afterwards from among you, surely I will chastise him with a chastisement with which I will not chastise, anyone among the nations. And behold! God will say: 'O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of God?' He will say: 'Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, Thou I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden.' And when God saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto mankind: Take me and my mother for two gods beside God? he saith: Be glorified! It was not mine to utter that to which I had no right. If I used to say it, then Thou knewest it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy Mind. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower of Things Hidden? And when God will say: O Isa son of Marium! did you say to men, Take me and my mother for two gods besides God he will say: Glory be to Thee, it did not befit me that I should say what I had no right to (say); if I had said it, Thou wouldst indeed have known it; Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I do not know what is in Thy mind, surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things. 'Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, to wit, 'worship God, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness to all things.' I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me, (saying): Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them, and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them. Thou art Witness over all things. I did not say to them aught save what Thou didst enjoin me with: That serve God, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness of them so long as I was among them, but when Thou didst cause me to die, Thou wert the watcher over them, and Thou art witness of all things. 'If Thou dost punish them, they are Thy servant: If Thou dost forgive them, Thou art the Exalted in power, the Wise.' If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them (lo! they are Thy slaves). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise. If Thou shouldst chastise them, then surely they are Thy servants; and if Thou shouldst forgive them, then surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise. God will say: 'This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal Home: God well-pleased with them, and they with God: That is the great salvation, (the fulfilment of all desires).'"This is a day in which their truthfulness profits the truthful, for theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they are secure forever, God taking pleasure in them and they in Him. That is the great triumph. God will say: This is the day when their truth shall benefit the truthful ones; they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them forever: God is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with God; this is the mighty achievement.

To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, and He has power over all things. Praise be to God, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light. Yet those who reject Faith hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord. He it is Who created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term for you. And there is in His presence another determined term; yet you doubt within yourselves! He is God in the heavens and on earth. He knows what you hide, and what you reveal, and He knows the recompense which you earn by your deeds.

But never did a single one of the signs of their Lord reach them, but they turned away from it. And now they reject the truth when it reaches them: but soon shall they learn the reality of what they used to mock at. See they not how many of those before them We did destroy? Generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you - for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave fertile streams flowing beneath their feet: yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations to succeed them.

If We had sent unto you a written message on parchment, so that they could touch it with their hands, the Unbelievers would have been sure to say: "This is nothing but obvious magic!" They say: "Why is not an angel sent down to him?" If we did send down an angel, the matter would be settled at once, and no respite would be granted them. If We had made it an angel, We should have sent him as a man, and We should certainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.

Mocked were many messengers before you; but their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked. Say: "Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth." Say: "To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "To God. He has inscribed for Himself the rule of Mercy. That He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment, there is no doubt whatever. It is they who have lost their own souls, that will not believe."

To Him belongs all that dwells or lurks in the night and the day. For He is the one who hears and knows all things. Say: "Shall I take for my protector any other than God, the Maker of the heavens and the earth? And He it is that feeds but is not fed." Say: "Nay! but I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to God in Islam, and be not of the company of those who join gods with God." Say: "I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the penalty of a Mighty Day."

On that day, if the penalty is averted from any, it is due to God's mercy; and that would be salvation, the obvious fulfillment of all desire. If God touches you with affliction, none can remove it but He; if He touches you with happiness, He has power over all things. He is the irresistible, watching from above over His worshippers; and He is the Wise, acquainted with all things. Say: "What thing is most weighty in evidence?" Say: "God is witness between me and you; this Qur'an has been revealed to me by inspiration, that I may warn you and all whom it reaches. Can you possibly bear witness that besides God there is another God?" Say: "Nay! I cannot bear witness!" Say: "But in truth He is the one God, and I truly am innocent of your blasphemy of joining others with Him."

Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have..."shall be made to swear by God (saying): We will not take a bribe, even though it were on behalf of a near kinsman nor will we hide the testimony of God, for then indeed we should be of the sinful. O you who believe! call to witness between you when death draws nigh to one of you, at the time of making the will, two just persons from among you, or two others from among others than you, if you are travelling in the land and the calamity of death befalls you; the two witnesses you should detain after the prayer; then if you doubt them, they shall both swear by God, saying: We will not take for it a price, though there be a relative, and we will not hide the testimony of God for then certainly we should be among the sinners. But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin of perjury, let two others stand forth in their places, nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right: let them swear by God: We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed beyond the truth: if we did, behold! the wrong be upon us! But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit the suspicion of sin, let two others take their place of those nearly concerned, and let them swear by God, saying: Verily our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed the bounds of duty, for then indeed we should be of the evil-doers. Then if it becomes known that they both have been guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up in their place from among those who have a claim against them, the two nearest in kin; so they two should swear by God: Certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not exceeded the limit, for then most surely we should be of the unjust. That is most suitable: that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape, or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths. But fear God, and listen to His counsel: for God guides not a rebellious people. Thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after their oaths the oaths of others will be taken. So be mindful of your duty to God and hearken. God guides not the froward folk. This is more proper in order that they should give testimony truly or fear that other oaths be given after their oaths; and be careful of your duty to God, and hear; and God does not guide the transgressing people. One day will God gather the messengers together, and ask: What was the response you received from men to your teaching? They will say: We have no knowledge: it is Thou Who knowest in full all that is hidden. In the day when God gathers together the messengers, and says: What was your response from mankind? they say: We have no knowledge. Thou, only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden. On the day when God will assemble the messengers, then say: What answer were you given? They shall say: We have no knowledge, surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things. Then will God say: O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the holy spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel and behold! thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and thou breathest into it and it becometh a bird by My leave, and thou healest those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And behold! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from violence to thee when thou didst show them the clear Signs, and the unbelievers among them said: This is nothing but evident magic. When God says: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour unto thee and unto thy mother; how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit, so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity; and how I taught thee the Scripture and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of a bird by My permission, and didst blow upon it and it was a bird by My permission, and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My permission; and how thou didst raise the dead by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from harming thee when thou camest unto them with clear proofs, and those of them who disbelieved exclaimed: This is naught else than mere magic; When God will say: O Isa son of Mary! Remember My favor on you and on your mother, when I strengthened you with the holy Spirit, you spoke to the people in the cradle and when of old age, and when I taught you the Book and the wisdom and the Taurat and the Injeel; and when you determined out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I withheld the children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments, but those who disbelieved among them said: This is nothing but clear enchantment. And behold! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and My Messenger: they said, 'We have faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to God as Muslims'. And when I inspired the disciples, saying: Believe in Me and in My messenger, they said: We believe. Bear witness that we have surrendered unto Thee we are Muslims. And when I revealed to the disciples, saying, Believe in Me and My messenger, they said: We believe and bear witness that we submit ourselves. Behold! the disciples, said: O Jesus the son of Mary! can thy Lord send down to us a table set with viands from heaven? Said Jesus: Fear God, if ye have faith. When the disciples said: O Jesus, son of Mary! Is thy Lord able to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said: Observe your duty to God, if ye are true believers. When the disciples said: O Isa son of Mary! will your Lord consent to send down to us food from heaven? He said: Be careful of your duty to God if you are believers. They said: We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts, and to know that thou hast indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may be witnesses to the miracle. They said: We desire that we should eat of it and that our hearts should be at rest, and that we may know that you have indeed spoken the truth to us and that we may be of the witnesses to it. Said Jesus the son of Mary: O God our Lord! Send us from heaven a table set with viands, that there may be for us - for the first and the last of us - a solemn festival and a sign from thee; and provide for our sustenance, for thou art the best Sustainer of our needs. Jesus, son of Mary, said: O God, Lord of us! Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers. Isa the son of Mary said: O God, our Lord! send down to us food from heaven which should be to us an ever-recurring happiness, to the first of us and to the last of us, and a sign from Thee, and grant us means of subsistence, and Thou art the best of the Providers. God said: I will send it down unto you: But if any of you after that resists faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one among all the peoples. God said: Lo! I send it down for you. And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward, him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any of My creatures. God said: Surely I will send it down to you, but whoever shall disbelieve afterwards from among you, surely I will chastise him with a chastisement with which I will not chastise, anyone among the nations. And behold! God will say: O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of God? He will say: Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right to say. Had I said such a thing, thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, Thou I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden. And when God saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto mankind: Take me and my mother for two gods beside God? he saith: Be glorified! It was not mine to utter that to which I had no right. If I used to say it, then Thou knewest it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy Mind. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower of Things Hidden. And when God will say: O Isa son of Mary! did you say to men, Take me and my mother for two gods besides God he will say: Glory be to Thee, it did not befit me that I should say what I had no right to say; if I had said it, Thou wouldst indeed have known it; Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I do not know what is in Thy mind, surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things. Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, to wit, worship God, my Lord and your Lord; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness to all things. I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me, saying: Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them, and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them. Thou art Witness over all things. I did not say to them aught save what Thou didst enjoin me with: That serve God, my Lord and your Lord, and I was a witness of them so long as I was among them, but when Thou didst cause me to die, Thou wert the watcher over them, and Thou art witness of all things. If Thou dost punish them, they are Thy servant: If Thou dost forgive them, Thou art the Exalted in power, the Wise. If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them lo! they are Thy slaves. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise. If Thou shouldst chastise them, then surely they are Thy servants; and if Thou shouldst forgive them, then surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise. God will say: This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are gardens, with rivers flowing beneath, their eternal Home: God well-pleased with them, and they with God: That is the great salvation, the fulfilment of all desires."Those to whom We have given the Book recognize this as they recognize their sons. Those who ruin their own souls will not believe. Who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against God or rejects His signs? The wrongdoers will not prosper. One day We shall gather them all together and say to those who ascribed partners to Us: "Where are the partners you talked about?" They will have no subterfuge but to say: "By God our Lord, we were not those who joined gods with God." See how they lie against their own souls, and the lie they invented will leave them in the lurch. Some pretend to listen to you, but We have thrown veils on their hearts and deafness in their ears; if they saw every sign, they would not believe. They dispute with you, saying: "These are tales of the ancients." They keep others away from it and themselves keep away, but they only destroy their own souls without perceiving it. If you could see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say: "Would that we were sent back! Then we would not reject the signs of our Lord but would be among the believers!" But if they were returned, they would relapse to what they were forbidden, for they are indeed liars. They say: "There is nothing except our life on this earth, and we shall not be raised up again." If you could see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say: "Is not this the truth?" They will say: "Yes, by our Lord!" He will say: "Taste the penalty because you rejected Faith." Lost indeed are those who treat it as falsehood that they must meet God, until the hour is on them suddenly, and they say: "Woe unto us that we took no thought of it"; for they bear their burdens on their backs, and evil indeed are the burdens they bear. What is the life of this world but play and amusement? But best is the home in the hereafter for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand? We know the grief their words cause you: it is not you they reject, but the signs of God. Rejected were the messengers before you; with patience and constancy, they bore their rejection and wrongs until Our aid reached them. There is none that can alter the words of God. If their spurning is hard on your mind, yet if you could seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign, what good would it do? If it were God's will, He could gather them together unto true guidance. Those who listen in truth will accept; as to the dead, God will raise them up, then they will be turned unto Him. They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "God has the power to send down a sign, but most of them do not understand." There is not an animal on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but they form communities like you. Nothing have We omitted from the Book, and they shall all be gathered to their Lord in the end. Those who reject Our signs are deaf and dumb, in the midst of profound darkness. Whom God wills, He leaves to wander; whom He wills, He places on a straight path. Say: "Think to yourselves, if there comes upon you the wrath of God or the Hour, will you then call upon anyone other than God?"This is a day in which their truthfulness profits the truthful, for theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they are secure forever, God taking pleasure in them and they in Him. That is the great triumph. God will say: This is the day when their truth shall benefit the truthful ones; they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them forever: God is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with God; this is the mighty achievement.

Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have..."Say: Can you see yourselves, if the punishment of God comes upon you or the Hour comes upon you, calling upon other than God? Do you then call for help to any other than God? Answer that if you are truthful. Nay, but unto Him you call, and He removes that because of which you call unto Him, if He wills, and you forget whatever partners you ascribed unto Him. Before you, We sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they might learn humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not learn humility? On the contrary, their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them. But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them the gates of all good things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts, We called them to account, and they were plunged in despair. So the last remnant of the wrong-doers was cut off. Praise be to God, the Cherisher of the worlds. Say: Think, if God took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who could restore them to you other than God? See how We explain the signs by various symbols, yet they turn aside. Say: Think, if the punishment of God comes to you, whether suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed except those who do wrong? We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend their lives, upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. But those who reject Our signs, punishment shall touch them for their transgressions. Say: I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of God, nor that I have knowledge of the unseen, nor that I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me. Say: Are the blind and the seeing equal? Will you not then take thought? Warn those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord, for whom there is no protector nor intercessor besides Him, that they may guard against evil. Do not drive away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. You are not accountable for them, nor are they accountable for you, that you should repel them and be of the wrong-doers. Thus do We try some of them by comparison with others, that they should say: Is it these whom God has favored from among us? Does not God know best those who are grateful? When those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: Peace be upon you. Your Lord has prescribed for Himself mercy, that if any of you does evil in ignorance and thereafter repents and amends, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Thus do We explain the signs in detail, that the way of the sinners may be shown up. Say: I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides God. Say: I will not follow your vain desires, for then I would stray from the path and not be of the rightly guided. Say: I am relying on clear proof from my Lord, while you deny Him. I have not that for which you are impatient. The decision is for God only. He tells the truth, and He is the best of judges. Say: If what you seek to hasten were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But God knows best those who do wrong. With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knows but He. He knows whatever is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but with His knowledge; there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry, but it is inscribed in a clear record."Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons; those who have lost their souls will not believe. Who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against God or rejects His signs? The wrongdoers will never prosper.

It is He who takes your souls by night and knows all that you have done by day. By day, He raises you up again so that a term appointed may be fulfilled. In the end, unto Him will be your return, and He will show you the truth of all that you did.

He is the irresistible, watching over His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. When death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty. Then are men returned unto God, their protector, the only reality. Is not His the command? He is the swiftest in taking account.

Say: "Who delivers you from the dark recesses of land and sea when you call upon Him in humility and silent terror: 'If He only delivers us from these dangers, we shall truly show our gratitude'?" Say: "It is God that delivers you from these and all other distresses, yet you worship false gods!"

Say: "He has the power to send calamities on you from above and below, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance." See how We explain the signs by various symbols so that they may understand.

But your people reject this, though it is the truth. Say: "Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs." For every message, there is a limit of time, and soon you shall know it.

When you see men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs, turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes you forget, then after recollection, do not sit in the company of those who do wrong.

On their account, no responsibility falls on the righteous, but their duty is to remind them so that they may learn to fear God. Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world. Proclaim to them that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts. It will find no protector or intercessor except God. If it offered every ransom, none will be accepted. Such is the end of those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts. They will have for drink only boiling water and for punishment, one most grievous, for they persisted in rejecting God.

Say: "Shall we indeed call on others besides God, things that can do us neither good nor harm, and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from God? Like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool, wandering bewildered through the earth, his friends calling, 'Come to us,' vainly guiding him to the path." Say: "God's guidance is the only guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds."

To establish regular prayers and to fear God, for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together. He created the heavens and the earth in true proportions. The day He says, "Be," it is. His word is the truth. His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knows the unseen as well as that which is open. He is the Wise, well acquainted with all things.

Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar: "Do you take idols for gods? For I see you and your people in manifest error." Thus did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the earth, that he might have certitude.

When the night covered him over, he saw a star and said, "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said, "I love not those that set." When he saw the moon rising in splendor, he said, "This is my Lord." But when the moon set, he said, "Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among those who go astray.""Say: Can you see yourselves, if the punishment of God comes upon you or the Hour comes upon you, calling upon other than God? Do you then call for help to any other than God? Answer that if you are truthful. Nay, on Him would you call, and if it be His will, He would remove the distress which occasioned your call upon Him, and you would forget the false gods you join with Him. Before you, We sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they might learn humility. When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not learn humility? On the contrary, their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them.

Say: I do not tell you that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me. Say: Are the blind and the seeing equal? Will you not then consider? Give this warning to those who fear that they will be brought to judgment before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor, that they may guard against evil. Repel not those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. You are not accountable for them, nor are they accountable for you, that you should repel them and be of the wrong-doers. Thus do We try some of them by comparison with others, that they should say: Is it these then that God has favored from amongst us? Does not God know best those who are grateful? When those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: Peace be on you. Your Lord has inscribed for Himself the rule of mercy: if any of you did evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented and amended his conduct, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Thus do We explain the signs in detail, that the way of the sinners may be shown up. Say: I am forbidden to worship those you call upon besides God. Say: I will not follow your vain desires, for then I would stray from the path and not be of the rightly guided. Say: I work on a clear sign from my Lord, but you reject Him. What you would see hastened is not in my power. The command rests with none but God: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges. Say: If what you would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But God knows best those who do wrong. With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none know but He. He knows whatever is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry, but it is inscribed in a clear record."When he saw the moon rising, he said: "Is this my Lord?" But when it set, he said: "If my Lord had not guided me, I would certainly be among the erring people." When he saw the sun rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord; this is the greatest." But when the sun set, he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from your guilt of giving partners to God." He then declared: "I have set my face firmly and truly towards Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I shall never give partners to God."

His people disputed with him, but he responded: "Do you dispute with me about God when He has guided me? I fear not the beings you associate with God unless my Lord wills it. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Will you not be admonished?" He continued: "How should I fear the beings you associate with God when you do not fear giving partners to God without any warrant? Which of us has more right to security if you know?"

Those who believe and do not mix their faith with wrongdoing are truly in security and rightly guided. This was the reasoning given to Abraham against his people. We raise whom We will, degree after degree, for your Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge. We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do good.

We also guided Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, all in the ranks of the righteous. And Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot; each one We preferred above Our creatures. We chose them and guided them to a straight path. This is the guidance of God, given to whom He pleases among His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him, all their deeds would be in vain.

These were the men to whom We gave the Book, authority, and prophethood. If their descendants reject them, We shall entrust their charge to a new people who will not reject them. Those were the prophets who received God's guidance. Follow their guidance and say: "No reward do I ask of you; this is a message for the nations."

They do not make a just estimate of God when they say: "Nothing does God send down to man by way of revelation." Say: "Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance to man?" You make it into separate sheets for show while concealing much of its contents. Say: "God sent it down." Then leave them to their vain discourse and trifling.

This is a blessed Book We have sent down, confirming the revelations before it, so that you may warn the mother of cities and all around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this Book and are constant in guarding their prayers. Who can be more wicked than one who invents a lie against God or says: "I have received inspiration," when he has received none? If you could see how the wicked fare in the flood of confusion at death, the angels stretch forth their hands, saying: "Yield up your souls; this day you shall receive your reward, a penalty of shame, for you used to tell lies against God and scornfully reject His signs."

And behold! You come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time. You have left behind all the favors We bestowed on you. We see not with you your intercessors whom you thought to be partners in your affairs. So now all relations between you have been cut off, and your fancies have left you in the lurch.And with Him are the keys of the unseen treasures; none knows them but He. He knows what is in the land and the sea, and not a leaf falls but He knows it, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything green nor dry but it is all in a clear book.

It is He who takes your souls by night and knows all that you have done by day. By day, He raises you up again so that a term appointed may be fulfilled. In the end, unto Him will be your return, and He will show you the truth of all that you did.

He is the irresistible, watching over His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. When death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty. Then are men returned unto God, their protector, the only reality. Is not His the command? He is the swiftest in taking account.

Say: "Who is it that delivers you from the dark recesses of land and sea when you call upon Him in humility and silent terror: 'If He only delivers us from these dangers, we shall truly show our gratitude'?" Say: "It is God that delivers you from these and all other distresses, yet you worship false gods!"

Say: "He has the power to send calamities on you from above and below, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance." See how We explain the signs by various symbols so that they may understand.

But your people reject this, though it is the truth. Say: "Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs." For every message is a limit of time, and soon you shall know it.

When you see men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs, turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes you forget, then after recollection, do not sit in the company of those who do wrong.

On their account, no responsibility falls on the righteous, but their duty is to remind them so that they may learn to fear God. Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world. Proclaim to them this truth: that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts. It will find for itself no protector or intercessor except God. If it offered every ransom, none will be accepted. Such is the end of those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts. They will have for drink only boiling water and for punishment, one most grievous, because they persisted in rejecting God.

Say: "Shall we indeed call on others besides God, things that can do us neither good nor harm, and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from God? Like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool, wandering bewildered through the earth, his friends calling, 'Come to us,' vainly guiding him to the path." Say: "God's guidance is the only guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds, to establish regular prayers and to fear God, for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together."

It is He who created the heavens and the earth in true proportions. The day He says, "Be," behold, it is. His word is the truth. His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knows the unseen as well as that which is open. For He is the Wise, well acquainted with all things.

Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar: "Do you take idols for gods? For I see you and your people in manifest error." So also did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the earth, that he might have certitude.

When the night covered him over, he saw a star and said: "This is my Lord." But when it set, he said: "I love not those that set." When he saw the moon rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord." But when the moon set, he said: "Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among those who go astray."When he saw the moon rising, he said: "Is this my Lord?" But when it set, he said: "If my Lord had not guided me, I would certainly be among the erring people." When he saw the sun rising in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord; this is the greatest." But when the sun set, he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from your guilt of giving partners to God." He then declared: "I have set my face firmly towards Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I shall not give partners to God."

His people disputed with him, but he responded: "Do you dispute with me about God when He has guided me? I fear not the beings you associate with God unless my Lord wills it. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Will you not be admonished?" He continued: "How should I fear the beings you associate with God when you do not fear to give partners to God without any warrant? Which of us has more right to security if you know?"

Those who believe and do not mix their faith with wrongdoing are truly secure and rightly guided. This was the reasoning given to Abraham against his people. We raise whom We will, degree by degree, for your Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge. We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do good.

Who can be more wicked than one who invents a lie against God or says: "I have received inspiration," when he has received none? If you could see how the wicked fare in the flood of confusion at death, the angels stretch forth their hands, saying: "Yield up your souls.

You come to Us bare and alone as We created you for the first time, leaving behind all the favors We bestowed on you. We see not with you your intercessors whom you thought to be partners in your affairs. All relations between you have been cut off, and your fancies have left you in the lurch."ors, of whom ye claimed that they possessed a share in you. Now is the bond between you severed, and that which ye presumed hath failed you. And certainly you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and you have left behind your backs the things which We gave you, and We do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted that they were (God's) associates in respect to you; certainly the ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted is gone from you.

It is God Who causes the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causes the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is God: then how are you deluded away from the truth? Surely God causes the grain and the stone to germinate; He brings forth the living from the dead and He is the bringer forth of the dead from the living; that is God! How are you then turned away?

He it is that cleaves the day-break (from the dark): He makes the night for rest and tranquility, and the sun and moon for the reckoning (of time): Such is the judgment and ordering of (Him), the Exalted in Power, the Omniscient. He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak, and He has appointed the night for stillness, and the sun and the moon for reckoning. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. He causes the dawn to break; and He has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon for reckoning; this is an arrangement of the Mighty, the Knowing.

It is He Who makes the stars (as beacons) for you, that you may guide yourselves, with their help, through the dark spaces of land and sea: We detail Our signs for people who know. And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you might follow the right way thereby in the darkness of the land and the sea; truly We have made plain the communications for a people who know.

It is He Who has produced you from a single person: here is a place of sojourn and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand. And He it is Who has brought you into being from a single soul, then there is (for you) a resting-place and a depository; indeed We have made plain the communications for a people who understand.

It is He Who sends down rain from the skies: with it We produce vegetation of all kinds: from some We produce green (crops), out of which We produce grain, heaped up (at harvest); out of the date-palm and its sheaths (or spathes) (come) clusters of dates hanging low and near: and (then there are) gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety): when they begin to bear fruit, feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof. Behold! in these things there are signs for people who believe.

Yet they make the jinns equals with God, though God did create the jinns; and they falsely, having no knowledge, attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him! (for He is) above what they attribute to Him! To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: How can He have a son when He has no consort? He created all things, and He has full knowledge of all things.

That is God, your Lord! There is no god but He, the Creator of all things: then worship Him: and He has power to dispose of all affairs. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things.

Now have come to you, from your Lord, proofs (to open your eyes): if any will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings. Proofs have come unto you from your Lord, so whoso sees, it is for his own good, and whoso is blind is blind to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper over you.

Thus do We explain the signs by various (symbols): that they may say, "Thou hast taught (us) diligently," and that We may make the matter clear to those who know. Follow what you are taught by inspiration from your Lord: there is no god but He: and turn aside from those who join gods with God. If it had been God's plan, they would not have taken false gods: but We made you not one to watch over their doings, nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs.

Revile not those whom they call upon besides God, lest they out of spite revile God in their ignorance. Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings. In the end will they return to their Lord, and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did. They swear their strongest oaths by God, that if a (special) sign came to them, by it they would believe. Say: "Certainly (all) signs are in the power of God: but what will make you (Muslims) realize that (even) if (special) signs came, they will not believe?"

We (too) shall turn to (confusion) their hearts and their eyes, even as they refused to believe in this in the first instance: We shall leave them in their trespasses, to wander in distraction. Even if We did send unto them angels, and the dead did speak unto them, and We gathered together all things before their very eyes, they are not the ones to believe, unless it is in God's plan. But most of them ignore (the truth).It is God Who causes the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. That is God: then how are you deluded away from the truth? He cleaves the daybreak from the dark, makes the night for rest and tranquility, and the sun and moon for the reckoning of time. This is the judgment and ordering of the Exalted in Power, the Omniscient. He makes the stars as beacons for you to guide yourselves through the dark spaces of land and sea. We detail Our signs for people who know.

He produced you from a single person, providing a place of sojourn and a place of departure. We detail Our signs for people who understand. He sends down rain from the skies, producing vegetation of all kinds: green crops, grain, date-palm clusters, gardens of grapes, olives, and pomegranates, each similar yet different in variety. Behold the fruit and its ripeness; in these are signs for people who believe.

Yet they make the jinn equals with God, though He created them, and falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him! He is above what they attribute to Him. He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no consort? He created all things and has full knowledge of all things. That is God, your Lord! There is no god but He, the Creator of all things. Worship Him; He has power to dispose of all affairs. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is above all comprehension, yet acquainted with all things.

Proofs have come to you from your Lord. Whoever sees, it is for his own good; whoever is blind, it is to his own harm. I am not a keeper over you. We explain the signs by various symbols so that they may say, "You have taught us diligently," and to make the matter clear to those who know. Follow what you are taught by inspiration from your Lord; there is no god but He. Turn aside from those who join gods with God. If it had been God's plan, they would not have taken false gods. We have not set you as a keeper over them, nor are you responsible for them.

Do not revile those whom they call upon besides God, lest they out of spite revile God in their ignorance. Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings. In the end, they will return to their Lord, and We shall tell them the truth of all that they did. They swear their strongest oaths by God that if a special sign came to them, they would believe. Say: "Certainly all signs are in the power of God." But what will make you realize that even if special signs came, they would not believe? We confound their hearts and eyes as they refused to believe in this in the first instance. We leave them in their trespasses, to wander in distraction.

Even if We sent angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered all things before their eyes, they would not believe unless God willed. Most of them ignore the truth.Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy—evil ones among men and jinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so planned, they would not have done it: so leave them and their inventions alone. Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an adversary—devils of humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile. If thy Lord willed, they would not do so; so leave them alone with their devising. And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, the Shaitans from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive them, and had your Lord pleased they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge.

To such deceit let the hearts of those incline, who have no faith in the hereafter: let them delight in it, and let them earn from it what they may. That the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter may incline thereto, and that they may take pleasure therein, and that they may earn what they are earning. And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it and that they may be well pleased with it and that they may earn what they are going to earn of evil.

Say: "Shall I seek for judge other than God?—when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book, explained in detail." They know full well, to whom We have given the Book, that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth. Never be then of those who doubt. Shall I seek other than God for judge, when He it is Who hath revealed unto you this Scripture, fully explained? Those unto whom We gave the Scripture aforetime know that it is revealed from thy Lord in truth. So be not thou of the waverers. Shall I then seek a judge other than God? And He it is Who has revealed to you the Book which is made plain; and those whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed by your Lord with truth, therefore you should not be of the disputers.

The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfillment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all. Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice. There is naught that can change His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower. And the word of your Lord has been accomplished truly and justly; there is none who can change His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth, they will lead thee away from the way of God. They follow nothing but conjecture: they do nothing but lie. If thou obeyedst most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from God's way. They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess. And if you obey most of those in the earth, they will lead you astray from God's way; they follow but conjecture and they only lie.

Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His way: He knoweth best who they are that receive His guidance. Lo! thy Lord, He knoweth best who erreth from His way; and He knoweth best who are the rightly guided. Surely your Lord He best knows who goes astray from His way, and He best knows those who follow the right course.

So eat of meats on which God's name hath been pronounced, if ye have faith in His signs. Eat of that over which the name of God hath been mentioned, if ye are believers in His revelations. Therefore eat of that on which God's name has been mentioned if you are believers in His communications.

Why should ye not eat of meats on which God's name hath been pronounced, when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you—except under compulsion of necessity? But many do mislead men by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress. How should ye not eat of that over which the name of God hath been mentioned, when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you unless ye are compelled thereto. But lo! many are led astray by their own lusts through ignorance. Lo! thy Lord, He is Best Aware of the transgressors. And what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which God's name has been mentioned, and He has already made plain to you what He has forbidden to you excepting what you are compelled to; and most surely many would lead people astray by their low desires out of ignorance; surely your Lord He best knows those who exceed the limits.

Eschew all sin, open or secret: those who earn sin will get due recompense for their earnings. Forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof. Lo! those who garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned. And abandon open and secret sin; surely they who earn sin shall be recompensed with what they earned.

Eat not of meats on which God's name hath not been pronounced: That would be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them, ye would indeed be Pagans. And eat not of that whereon God's name hath not been mentioned, for lo! it is abomination. Lo! the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you. But if ye obey them, ye will be in truth idolaters. And do not eat of that on which God's name has not been mentioned, and that is most surely a transgression; and most surely the Shaitans suggest to their friends that they should contend with you; and if you obey them, you shall most surely be polytheists.

Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a light whereby he can walk amongst men, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he can never come out? Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing. Is he who was dead and We have raised him unto life, and set for him a light wherein he walketh among men, as him whose similitude is in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge? Thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the disbelievers. Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth? Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the unbelievers.

Thus have We placed leaders in every town, its wicked men, to plot therein: but they only plot against their own souls, and they perceive it not. And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones, that they should plot therein. They do but plot against themselves, though they perceive not. And thus have We made in every town the great ones to be its guilty ones, that they may plan therein; and they do not plan but against their own souls, and they do not perceive.

When there comes to them a sign from God, They say: "We shall not believe until we receive one exactly like those received by God's messengers." God knoweth best where and how to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before God, and a severe punishment, for all their plots. And when a token cometh unto them, they say: We will not believe till we are given that which God's messengers are given. God knoweth best with whom to place His message. Humiliation from God and heavy punishment will smite the guilty for their scheming. And when a communication comes to them they say: We will not believe till we are given the like of what God's messengers are given. God best knows where He places His message. There shall befall those who are guilty humiliation from God and severe chastisement because of what they planned.

Those whom God in His plan willeth to guide, He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying, He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth God heap the penalty on those who refuse to believe. And whomsoever it is God's will to guide, He expandeth his bosom unto the Surrender, and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray, He maketh his bosom close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent. Thus God layeth ignominy upon those who believe not. Therefore for whomsoever God intends that He would guide him aright, He expands his breast for Islam, and for whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err, He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards; thus does God lay uncleanness on those who do not believe.

This is the way of thy Lord, leading straight: We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition. This is the path of thy Lord, a straight path. We have detailed Our revelations for a people who take heed. And this is the path of your Lord, a right path; indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who mind.

For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend, because they practised righteousness. For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their Protecting Friend because of what they used to do. They shall have the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is their guardian because of what they did.

One day will He gather them all together, and say: "O ye assembly of jinns! Much toll did ye take of men." Their friends amongst men will say: "Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but alas! we reached our term which thou didst appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as God willeth." for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge. In the day when He will gather them together He will say: O ye assembly of the jinn! Many of humankind did ye seduce. And their adherents among humankind will say: Our Lord! We enjoyed one another, but now we have arrived at the appointed term which Thou appointedst for us. He will say: Fire is your home. Abide therein for ever, save him whom God willeth to deliver. Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Aware. And on the day when He shall gather them all together: O assembly of jinn! you took away a great part of mankind. And their friends from among the men shall say: Our Lord! some of us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term which Thou didst appoint for us. He shall say: The fire is your abode, to abide in it, except as God is pleased; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing.

Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what they earn. Thus We let some of the wrong-doers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn. And thus do We make some of the iniquitous to befriend others on account of what they earned.

O ye assembly of jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you, setting forth unto you My signs.Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy—evil ones among men and jinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so planned, they would not have done it: so leave them and their inventions alone. Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an adversary—devils of humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile. If thy Lord willed, they would not do so; so leave them alone with their devising. And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, the Shaitans from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive them, and had your Lord pleased they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge.

To such deceit let the hearts of those incline, who have no faith in the hereafter: let them delight in it, and let them earn from it what they may. That the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter may incline thereto, and that they may take pleasure therein, and that they may earn what they are earning. And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it and that they may be well pleased with it and that they may earn what they are going to earn of evil.

Say: "Shall I seek for judge other than God?—when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book, explained in detail." They know full well, to whom We have given the Book, that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth. Never be then of those who doubt. Shall I seek other than God for judge, when He it is Who hath revealed unto you this Scripture, fully explained? Those unto whom We gave the Scripture aforetime know that it is revealed from thy Lord in truth. So be not thou of the waverers. Shall I then seek a judge other than God? And He it is Who has revealed to you the Book which is made plain; and those whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed by your Lord with truth, therefore you should not be of the disputers.

The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfillment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all. Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice. There is naught that can change His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower. And the word of your Lord has been accomplished truly and justly; there is none who can change His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

If thou obeyedst most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from God's way. They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess. And if you obey most of those in the earth, they will lead you astray from God's way; they follow but conjecture and they only lie.

Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His way: He knoweth best who they are that receive His guidance. Lo! thy Lord, He knoweth best who erreth from His way; and He knoweth best who are the rightly guided. Surely your Lord He best knows who goes astray from His way, and He best knows those who follow the right course.

So eat of meats on which God's name hath been pronounced, if ye have faith in His signs. Eat of that over which the name of God hath been mentioned, if ye are believers in His revelations. Therefore eat of that on which God's name has been mentioned if you are believers in His communications.

Why should ye not eat of meats on which God's name hath been pronounced, when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you—except under compulsion of necessity? But many do mislead men by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress. How should ye not eat of that over which the name of God hath been mentioned, when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you unless ye are compelled thereto. But lo! many are led astray by their own lusts through ignorance. Lo! thy Lord, He is Best Aware of the transgressors. And what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which God's name has been mentioned, and He has already made plain to you what He has forbidden to you excepting what you are compelled to; and most surely many would lead people astray by their low desires out of ignorance; surely your Lord He best knows those who exceed the limits.

Eschew all sin, open or secret: those who earn sin will get due recompense for their earnings. Forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof. Lo! those who garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned. And abandon open and secret sin; surely they who earn sin shall be recompensed with what they earned.

Eat not of meats on which God's name hath not been pronounced: That would be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them, ye would indeed be Pagans. And eat not of that whereon God's name hath not been mentioned, for lo! it is abomination. Lo! the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you. But if ye obey them, ye will be in truth idolaters. And do not eat of that on which God's name has not been mentioned, and that is most surely a transgression; and most surely the Shaitans suggest to their friends that they should contend with you; and if you obey them, you shall most surely be polytheists.

Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a light whereby he can walk amongst men, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he can never come out? Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing. Is he who was dead and We have raised him unto life, and set for him a light wherein he walketh among men, as him whose similitude is in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge? Thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the disbelievers. Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth? Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the unbelievers.

Thus have We placed leaders in every town, its wicked men, to plot therein: but they only plot against their own souls, and they perceive it not. And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones, that they should plot therein. They do but plot against themselves, though they perceive not. And thus have We made in every town the great ones to be its guilty ones, that they may plan therein; and they do not plan but against their own souls, and they do not perceive.

When there comes to them a sign from God, They say: "We shall not believe until we receive one exactly like those received by God's messengers." God knoweth best where and how to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before God, and a severe punishment, for all their plots. And when a token cometh unto them, they say: We will not believe till we are given that which God's messengers are given. God knoweth best with whom to place His message. Humiliation from God and heavy punishment will smite the guilty for their scheming. And when a communication comes to them they say: We will not believe till we are given the like of what God's messengers are given. God best knows where He places His message. There shall befall those who are guilty humiliation from God and severe chastisement because of what they planned.

Those whom God in His plan willeth to guide, He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying, He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth God heap the penalty on those who refuse to believe. And whomsoever it is God's will to guide, He expandeth his bosom unto the Surrender, and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray, He maketh his bosom close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent. Thus God layeth ignominy upon those who believe not. Therefore for whomsoever God intends that He would guide him aright, He expands his breast for Islam, and for whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err, He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards; thus does God lay uncleanness on those who do not believe.

This is the way of thy Lord, leading straight: We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition. This is the path of thy Lord, a straight path. We have detailed Our revelations for a people who take heed. And this is the path of your Lord, a right path; indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who mind.

For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend, because they practised righteousness. For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their Protecting Friend because of what they used to do. They shall have the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is their guardian because of what they did.

One day will He gather them all together, and say: "O ye assembly of jinns! Much toll did ye take of men." Their friends amongst men will say: "Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but alas! we reached our term—which thou didst appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as God willeth." for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge. In the day when He will gather them together He will say: O ye assembly of the jinn! Many of humankind did ye seduce. And their adherents among humankind will say: Our Lord! We enjoyed one another, but now we have arrived at the appointed term which Thou appointedst for us. He will say: Fire is your home. Abide therein for ever, save him whom God willeth to deliver. Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Aware. And on the day when He shall gather them all together: O assembly of jinn! you took away a great part of mankind. And their friends from among the men shall say: Our Lord! some of us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term which Thou didst appoint for us. He shall say: The fire is your abode, to abide in it, except as God is pleased; surely your Lord is Wise, Knowing.

Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what they earn. Thus We let some of the wrong-doers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn. And thus do We make some of the iniquitous to befriend others on account of what they earned.

O ye assembly of jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you, setting forth unto you My signs."and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves." It was the life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith.

O assembly of jinn and humankind! Did messengers not come to you, recounting My signs and warning you of this Day? They will say: We testify against ourselves. The life of the world beguiled them, and they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.

This is because your Lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people were negligent.

To all are degrees according to their deeds: for your Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do.

Your Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if He wills, He could destroy you and appoint whom He wills as your successors, even as He raised you from the posterity of other people.

All that has been promised to you will come to pass, and you cannot escape it.

Say: "O my people! Do whatever you can: I will do my part. Soon you will know who will have the best end in the Hereafter. The wrong-doers will not prosper."

Out of what God has produced in abundance in tilth and cattle, they assigned Him a share: they say, "This is for God, and this is for our partners." But the share of their partners does not reach God, while the share of God reaches their partners. Evil is their assignment!

Even so, in the eyes of most pagans, their partners made alluring the slaughter of their children, to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. If God had willed, they would not have done so. Leave them and their inventions.

They say that certain cattle and crops are taboo, and none should eat of them except those whom they wish. Further, there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden, and cattle on which the name of God is not pronounced. These are inventions against God's name. He will soon requite them for their inventions.

They say: "What is in the wombs of such cattle is reserved for our men, and forbidden to our women; but if it is still-born, then all have a share in it." For their false attribution, He will soon punish them, for He is full of wisdom and knowledge.

Lost are those who slay their children from folly, without knowledge, and forbid food which God has provided for them, inventing lies against God. They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance.

It is He Who produces gardens, with trellises and without, and dates, and tilth with produce of all kinds, and olives and pomegranates, similar and different. Eat of their fruit in their season, but render the dues that are proper on the day of harvest. Waste not by excess, for God loves not the wasters.

Of the cattle, some are for burden and some for meat. Eat what God has provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for he is an avowed enemy to you.

Take eight head of cattle in four pairs: of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair. Say, has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or the young which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with knowledge if you are truthful.

Of camels a pair, and oxen a pair. Say, has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or the young which the wombs of the two females enclose? Were you present when God ordered you such a thing? Who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against God to lead men astray without knowledge? God does not guide people who do wrong.

Say: "I find not in the message received by me by inspiration any meat forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine.""and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves." It was the life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith.

O assembly of jinn and humankind! Did messengers not come to you, recounting My signs and warning you of this Day? They will say: We testify against ourselves. The life of the world beguiled them, and they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.

(The messengers were sent) thus, for your Lord would not destroy men's habitations for their wrongdoing while their occupants were unwarned. This is because your Lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people were negligent.

To all are degrees according to their deeds: for your Lord is not unmindful of anything they do. For all, there will be ranks from what they did. Your Lord is not unaware of what they do.

Your Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if He wills, He could destroy you and appoint whom He wills as your successors, even as He raised you from the posterity of other people. Your Lord is the Absolute, the Lord of Mercy. If He wills, He can remove you and cause what He wills to follow after you, as He raised you from the seed of other folk.

All that has been promised to you will come to pass, and you cannot escape it. That which you are promised will surely come to pass, and you cannot escape it.

Say: "O my people! Do whatever you can: I will do my part. Soon you will know who will have the best end in the Hereafter. The wrong-doers will not prosper." Say: O my people! Work according to your power. I too am working. You will come to know for which of us will be the happy sequel. The wrong-doers will not be successful.

Out of what God has produced in abundance in tilth and cattle, they assigned Him a share: they say, according to their fancies: "This is for God, and this is for our partners!" But the share of their partners does not reach God, while the share of God reaches their partners. Evil and unjust is their assignment!

Even so, in the eyes of most pagans, their partners made the slaughter of their children alluring, to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. If God had willed, they would not have done so. Leave them and their inventions.

They say that certain cattle and crops are taboo, and none should eat of them except those whom they wish. Further, there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden, and cattle on which the name of God is not pronounced. These are inventions against God's name. He will requite them for their inventions.

They say: "What is in the wombs of certain cattle is reserved for our men and forbidden to our women; but if it is stillborn, then all have a share in it." For their false attribution of superstitions to God, He will soon punish them. He is full of wisdom and knowledge.

Lost are those who slay their children from folly, without knowledge, and forbid food which God has provided for them, inventing lies against God. They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance.

It is He Who produces gardens, with trellises and without, and dates, and tilth with produce of all kinds, and olives and pomegranates, similar in kind and different in variety. Eat of their fruit in their season, but render the dues that are proper on the day of the harvest. Waste not by excess, for God loves not the wasters.

Of the cattle, some are for burden and some for meat. Eat what God has provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan, for he is an avowed enemy to you.

(Take) eight head of cattle in four pairs: of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair. Say, has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or the young which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with knowledge if you are truthful.

Of camels a pair, and oxen a pair. Say, has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or the young which the wombs of the two females enclose? Were you present when God ordered you such a thing? Who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against God to lead men astray without knowledge? God does not guide people who do wrong.

Say: "I find not in the message received by me by inspiration any meat forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine."It is an abomination - or, what is impious, (meat) on which a name has been invoked, other than God's. But if a person is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, thy Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Say: I find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swineflesh - for that verily is foul - or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than God. But whoso is compelled (thereto), neither craving nor transgressing, (for him) lo! thy Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.

For those who followed the Jewish Law, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their willful disobedience: for We are true (in Our ordinances).

If they accuse thee of falsehood, say: "Your Lord is full of mercy all-embracing; but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back."

Those who give partners (to God) will say: "If God had wished, we should not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers; nor should we have had any taboos." So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted of Our wrath. Say: "Have ye any (certain) knowledge? If so, produce it before us. Ye follow nothing but conjecture: ye do nothing but lie."

Say: "With God is the argument that reaches home: if it had been His will, He could indeed have guided you all."

Say: "Bring forward your witnesses to prove that God did forbid so and so." If they bring such witnesses, be not thou amongst them: Nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat our signs as falsehoods, and such as believe not in the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord.

Say: "Come, I will rehearse what God hath (really) prohibited you from": Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;- We provide sustenance for you and for them;- come not nigh to shameful deeds. Whether open or secret; take not life, which God hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.

And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfill the covenant of God: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember.

Verily, this is My way, leading straight: follow it: follow not (other) paths: they will scatter you about from His (great) path: thus doth He command you, that ye may be righteous.

Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing (Our favor) to those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail,- and a guide and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.

And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous, that ye may receive mercy:

Lest ye should say: "The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study:"

Or lest ye should say: "If the Book had only been sent down to us, we should have followed its guidance better than they." Now then hath come unto you a clear (sign) from your Lord,- and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth God's signs, and turneth away therefrom? In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our signs, with a dreadful penalty, for their turning away.

Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them, or thy Lord (Himself), or certain of the signs of thy Lord! The day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if it believed not before nor earned righteousness through its faith. Say: "Wait ye: we too are waiting."It is an abomination - or, what is impious, (meat) on which a name has been invoked, other than God's. But if a person is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, thy Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Say: I find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swineflesh - for that verily is foul - or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than God. But whoso is compelled (thereto), neither craving nor transgressing, (for him) lo! thy Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.

For those who followed the Jewish Law, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their willful disobedience: for We are true (in Our ordinances).

Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws. And of the oxen and the sheep, We forbade them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone. That we awarded them for their rebellion. And lo! we verily are truthful.

And to those who were Jews We made unlawful every animal having claws, and of oxen and sheep We made unlawful to them the fat of both, except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was mixed with bones: this was a punishment We gave them on account of their rebellion, and We are surely Truthful.

If they accuse thee of falsehood, say: "Your Lord is full of mercy all-embracing; but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back."

So if they give the lie to thee (Muhammad), say: Your Lord is a Lord of all-embracing Mercy, and His wrath will never be withdrawn from guilty folk.

But if they give you the lie, then say: Your Lord is the Lord of All-encompassing mercy; and His punishment cannot be averted from the guilty people.

Those who give partners (to God) will say: "If God had wished, we should not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers; nor should we have had any taboos." So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted of Our wrath. Say: "Have ye any (certain) knowledge? If so, produce it before us. Ye follow nothing but conjecture: ye do nothing but lie."

They who are idolaters will say: Had God willed, we had not ascribed (unto Him) partners neither had our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught. Thus did those who were before them give the lie (to God's messengers) till they tasted of the fear of Us. Say: Have ye any knowledge that ye can adduce for Us? Lo! ye follow naught but an opinion, Lo! ye do but guess.

Those who are polytheists will say: If God had pleased we would not have associated (aught with Him) nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden (to ourselves) anything; even so did those before them reject until they tasted Our punishment. Say: Have you any knowledge with you so you should bring it forth to us? You only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies.

Say: "With God is the argument that reaches home: if it had been His will, He could indeed have guided you all."

Say - For God's is the final argument - Had He willed He could indeed have guided all of you.

Say: Then God's is the conclusive argument; so if He please, He would certainly guide you all.

Say: "Bring forward your witnesses to prove that God did forbid so and so." If they bring such witnesses, be not thou amongst them: Nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat our signs as falsehoods, and such as believe not in the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord.

Say: Come, bring your witnesses who can bear witness that God forbade (all) this. And if they bear witness, do not thou bear witness with them. Follow thou not the whims of those who deny Our revelations, those who believe not in the Hereafter and deem (others) equal with their Lord.

Say: Bring your witnesses who should bear witness that God has forbidden this, then if they bear witness, do not bear witness with them; and follow not the low desires of those who reject Our communications and of those who do not believe in the hereafter, and they make (others) equal to their Lord.

Say: "Come, I will rehearse what God hath (really) prohibited you from": Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;- We provide sustenance for you and for them;- come not nigh to shameful deeds. Whether open or secret; take not life, which God hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.

Say: Come, I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred duty for you: That ye ascribe no thing as partner unto Him and that ye do good to parents, and that ye slay not your children because of penury - We provide for you and for them - and that ye draw not nigh to lewd things whether open or concealed. And that ye slay not the life which God hath made sacred, save in the course of justice. This He hath command you, in order that ye may discern.

Say: Come I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you (remember) that you do not associate anything with Him and show kindness to your parents, and do not slay your children for (fear of) poverty We provide for you and for them and do not draw nigh to indecencies, those of them which are apparent and those which are concealed, and do not kill the soul which God has forbidden except for the requirements of justice; this He has enjoined you with that you may understand.

And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil the covenant of God: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember.

And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better, till he reach maturity. Give full measure and full weight, in justice. We task not any soul beyond its scope. And if ye give your word, do justice thereunto, even though it be (against) a kinsman; and fulfil the covenant of God. This He commandeth you that haply ye may remember.

And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner until he attains his maturity, and give full measure and weight with justice We do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability; and when you speak, then be just though it be (against) a relative, and fulfill God's covenant; this He has enjoined you with that you may be mindful;

Verily, this is My way, leading straight: follow it: follow not (other) paths: they will scatter you about from His (great) path: thus doth He command you, that ye may be righteous.

And (He commandeth you, saying): This is My straight path, so follow it. Follow not other ways, lest ye be parted from His way. This hath He ordained for you, that ye may ward off (evil).

And (know) that this is My path, the right one therefore follow it, and follow not (other) ways, for they will lead you away from His way; this He has enjoined you with that you may guard (against evil).

Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing (Our favour) to those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail,- and a guide and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.

Again, We gave the Scripture unto Moses, complete for him who would do good, an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.

Again, We gave the Book to Musa to complete (Our blessings) on him who would do good (to others), and making plain all things and a guidance and a mercy, so that they should believe in the meeting of their Lord.

And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous, that ye may receive mercy:

And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed. So follow it and ward off (evil), that ye may find mercy.

And this is a Book We have revealed, blessed; therefore follow it and guard (against evil) that mercy may be shown to you.

Lest ye should say: "The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study:"

Lest ye should say: The Scripture was revealed only to two sects before us, and we in sooth were unaware of what they read;

Lest you say that the Book was only revealed to two parties before us and We were truly unaware of what they read.

Or lest ye should say: "If the Book had only been sent down to us, we should have followed its guidance better than they." Now then hath come unto you a clear (sign) from your Lord,- and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth God's signs, and turneth away therefrom? In good time shall We requite those who turn away from Our signs, with a dreadful penalty, for their turning away.

Or lest ye should say: If the Scripture had been revealed unto us, we surely had been better guided than are they. Now hath there come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, a guidance and mercy; and who doeth greater wrong than he who denieth the revelations of God, and turneth away from them? We award unto those who turn away from Our revelations an evil doom because of their aversion.

Or lest you should say: If the Book had been revealed to us, we would certainly have been better guided than they, so indeed there has come to you clear proof from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who then is more unjust than he who rejects God's communications and turns away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our communications with an evil chastisement because they turned away.

Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them, or thy Lord (Himself), or certain of the signs of thy Lord! the day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if it believed not before nor earned righteousness through its faith. Say: "Wait ye: we too are waiting."

Wait they, indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them, or thy Lord should come, or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord? In the day when one of the portents from thy Lord cometh, its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore believed not, nor in its belief earned good (by works). Say: Wait ye! Lo! We (too) are waiting. 

They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. Say: Wait; we too are waiting.

As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou hast no part in them in the least: their affair is with God: He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did.

Lo! As for those who sunder their religion and become schismatics, no concern at all hast thou with them. Their case will go to God, Who then will tell them what they used to do.

Surely they who divided their religion into parts and became sects, you have no concern with them; their affair is only with God, then He will inform them of what they did.

He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: no wrong shall be done unto (any of) them.

Whoso bringeth a good deed will receive tenfold the like thereof, while whoso bringeth an ill-deed will be awarded but the like thereof; and they will not be wronged.

Whoever brings a good deed, he shall have ten like it, and whoever brings an evil deed, he shall be recompensed only with the like of it, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.

Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a religion of right,- the path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with God."

Say: Lo! As for me, my Lord hath guided me unto a straight path, a right religion, the community of Abraham, the upright, who was no idolater.

Say: Surely, (as for) me, my Lord has guided me to the right path; (to) a most right religion, the faith of Ibrahim the upright one, and he was not of the polytheists.

Say: "Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are (all) for God, the Cherisher of the Worlds:"

Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for God, Lord of the Worlds.

Say. Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for God, the Lord of the worlds;

No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who bow to His will.

He hath no partner. This am I commanded, and I am first of those who surrender (unto Him).

No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.

Say: "Shall I seek for (my) Cherisher other than God, when He is the Cherisher of all things (that exist)? Every soul draws the meed of its acts on none but itself: no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. Your goal in the end is towards God: He will tell you the truth of the things wherein ye disputed."

Say: Shall I seek another than God for Lord, when He is Lord of all things? Each soul earneth only on its own account, nor doth any laden bear another's load. Then unto your Lord is your return and He will tell you that wherein ye differed.

Say: What! shall I seek a Lord other than God? And He is the Lord of all things; and no soul earns (evil) but against itself, and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, so He will inform you of that in which you differed.

It is He Who hath made you (His) agents, inheritors of the earth: He hath raised you in ranks, some above others: that He may try you in the gifts He hath given you: for thy Lord is quick in punishment: yet He is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

He it is Who hath placed you as viceroys of the earth and hath exalted some of you in rank above others, that He may try you by (the test of) that which He hath given you. Lo! Thy Lord is swift in prosecution, and Lo! He verily is Forgiving, Merciful.

And He it is Who has made you successors in the land and raised some of you above others by (various) grades, that He might try you by what He has given you; surely your Lord is quick to requite (evil), and He is most surely the Forgiving, the Merciful.tents from thy Lord? In the day when one of the portents from thy Lord cometh, its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore believed not, nor in its belief earned good (by works). Say: Wait ye! Lo! We (too) are waiting. They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. Say: Wait; we too are waiting.

As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou hast no part in them in the least: their affair is with God: He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did. Lo! As for those who sunder their religion and become schismatics, no concern at all hast thou with them. Their case will go to God, Who then will tell them what they used to do. Surely they who divided their religion into parts and became sects, you have no concern with them; their affair is only with God, then He will inform them of what they did.

He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: no wrong shall be done unto (any of) them. Whoso bringeth a good deed will receive tenfold the like thereof, while whoso bringeth an ill-deed will be awarded but the like thereof; and they will not be wronged. Whoever brings a good deed, he shall have ten like it, and whoever brings an evil deed, he shall be recompensed only with the like of it, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.

Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a religion of right,- the path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with God." Say: Lo! As for me, my Lord hath guided me unto a straight path, a right religion, the community of Abraham, the upright, who was no idolater. Say: Surely, (as for) me, my Lord has guided me to the right path; (to) a most right religion, the faith of Ibrahim the upright one, and he was not of the polytheists.

Say: "Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are (all) for God, the Cherisher of the Worlds:" Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for God, Lord of the Worlds. Say. Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for God, the Lord of the worlds;

No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who bow to His will. He hath no partner. This am I commanded, and I am first of those who surrender (unto Him). No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.

Say: "Shall I seek for (my) Cherisher other than God, when He is the Cherisher of all things (that exist)? Every soul draws the meed of its acts on none but itself: no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. Your goal in the end is towards God: He will tell you the truth of the things wherein ye disputed." Say: Shall I seek another than God for Lord, when He is Lord of all things? Each soul earneth only on its own account, nor doth any laden bear another's load. Then unto your Lord is your return and He will tell you that wherein ye differed. Say: What! shall I seek a Lord other than God? And He is the Lord of all things; and no soul earns (evil) but against itself, and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, so He will inform you of that in which you differed.

It is He Who hath made you (His) agents, inheritors of the earth: He hath raised you in ranks, some above others: that He may try you in the gifts He hath given you: for thy Lord is quick in punishment: yet He is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. He it is Who hath placed you as viceroys of the earth and hath exalted some of you in rank above others, that He may try you by (the test of) that which He hath given you. Lo! Thy Lord is swift in prosecution, and Lo! He verily is Forgiving, Merciful. And He it is Who has made you successors in the land and raised some of you above others by (various) grades, that He might try you by what He has given you; surely your Lord is quick to requite (evil), and He is most surely the Forgiving, the Merciful.He said: "Get out, despised and banished. Whoever follows you, I will fill Hell with all of you."

"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Garden and eat from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or you will be wrongdoers."

Then Satan whispered to them to reveal their shame, saying: "Your Lord only forbade you this tree lest you become angels or immortals."

He swore to them: "I am a sincere adviser to you."

By deceit, he brought about their fall. When they tasted the tree, their shame became manifest, and they began to cover themselves with leaves. Their Lord called: "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you that Satan is an avowed enemy?"

They said: "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy, we will be lost."

He said: "Get down, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling and livelihood for a time."

"Therein shall you live, die, and be brought forth."

"O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness is best. This is among the Signs of God, that you may receive admonition."

"Let not Satan seduce you as he got your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment to expose their shame. He and his tribe watch you from where you cannot see them. We made the evil ones friends only to those without faith."

"When they do shameful deeds, they say: 'We found our fathers doing so,' and 'God commanded us thus.' Say: 'God never commands shameful deeds. Do you say of God what you do not know?'"

"My Lord has commanded justice. Set your whole selves to Him at every time and place of prayer, and call upon Him sincerely. As He created you in the beginning, so shall you return."

"Some He has guided; others have deserved the loss of their way, taking the evil ones as friends and protectors instead of God, thinking they are guided."

"O Children of Adam! Wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer. Eat and drink, but waste not by excess, for God loves not the wasters."

"Who has forbidden the beautiful gifts of God, which He has produced for His servants, and the clean and pure things for sustenance? They are for those who believe in this world, and purely for them on the Day of Judgment. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who understand."

"My Lord has forbidden shameful deeds, whether open or secret, sins and trespasses against truth or reason, assigning partners to God without authority, and saying things about God of which you have no knowledge."

"To every people is a term appointed. When their term is reached, they cannot delay nor advance it."

"O Children of Adam! Whenever messengers come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing My signs, those who are righteous and mend their lives shall have no fear nor shall they grieve."

"But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein forever."He said: "Get out, despised and banished. Whoever follows you, I will fill Hell with you all."

"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Garden and eat freely, but do not approach this tree, or you will be wrongdoers."

Satan whispered to them to reveal their shame, saying, "Your Lord only forbade this tree to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals." He swore to them, "I am a sincere adviser to you."

By deceit, he led them to taste the tree, revealing their shame. They covered themselves with leaves. Their Lord called, "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you Satan is an enemy?"

They said, "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy, we will be lost."

God said, "Get down, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling and livelihood for a time."

"There you will live, die, and be brought forth."

"O Children of Adam! We have given you raiment to cover your shame and for adornment, but the raiment of righteousness is best. These are signs of God for admonition."

"Let not Satan seduce you as he expelled your parents from the Garden, stripping them of their raiment to expose their shame. He and his tribe see you from where you cannot see them. We made the devils friends to those without faith."

"When they commit shameful acts, they say, 'We found our fathers doing this, and God commanded it.' Say: God does not command shameful deeds. Do you say about God what you do not know?"

"My Lord commands justice. Set your faces upright at every place of worship and call upon Him sincerely. As He created you, so shall you return."

"Some He has guided, others have deserved loss for taking devils as friends instead of God, thinking they are guided."

"O Children of Adam! Wear your beautiful apparel at every place of prayer, eat and drink, but do not waste by excess, for God loves not the wasters."

"Who has forbidden the beautiful gifts of God? They are for those who believe in this world and purely for them on the Day of Judgment. Thus, We explain the signs for those who understand."

"My Lord forbids shameful deeds, sins, wrongful oppression, associating partners with God without authority, and saying things about God without knowledge."

"Every nation has its term. When it comes, they cannot delay or advance it."

"O Children of Adam! When messengers come to you, narrating My revelations, those who refrain from evil and amend will have no fear nor will they grieve."

"But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein.""Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against God or rejects His Signs? For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until, when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: 'Where are the things that you used to invoke besides God?' They will reply, 'They have left us in the lurch,' and they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected God.

He will say: 'Enter into the Fire among nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before you. Every time a nation enters, it curses its sister-nation until they follow each other into the Fire. The last will say about the first: 'Our Lord! It is these that misled us: so give them a double penalty in the Fire.' He will say: 'Doubled for all,' but this you do not understand.

Then the first will say to the last: 'See then! No advantage have you over us; so taste the penalty for all that you did!' To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Such is Our reward for those in sin.

For them, there is Hell, as a couch below and folds of covering above: such is Our requital of those who do wrong. But those who believe and work righteousness, no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear, they will be Companions of the Garden, therein to dwell forever.

And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury; beneath them will be rivers flowing, and they shall say: 'Praise be to God, who has guided us to this felicity: never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of God: indeed it was the truth, that the messengers of our Lord brought unto us.' And they shall hear the cry: 'Behold! The garden before you! You have been made its inheritors, for your deeds of righteousness.'

The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire: 'We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true: Have you also found Your Lord's promises true?' They shall say, 'Yes'; but a crier shall proclaim between them: 'The curse of God is on the wrong-doers, those who would hinder men from the path of God and would seek in it something crooked: they were those who denied the Hereafter.'

Between them shall be a veil, and on the heights will be men who would know everyone by his marks: they will call out to the Companions of the Garden, 'Peace on you': they will not have entered, but they will have an assurance thereof. When their eyes shall be turned towards the Companions of the Fire, they will say: 'Our Lord! Send us not to the company of the wrong-doers.'

The men on the heights will call to certain men whom they will know from their marks, saying: 'Of what profit to you were your hoards and your arrogant ways?' Behold! Are these not the men whom you swore that God with His Mercy would never bless? Enter the Garden: no fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve.

The Companions of the Fire will call to the Companions of the Garden: 'Pour down to us water or anything that God provides for your sustenance.' They will say: 'Both these things God has forbidden to those who rejected Him, who took their religion to be mere amusement and play, and were deceived by the life of the world.' That day We shall forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and as they were wont to reject Our signs.

For We had certainly sent unto them a Book, based on knowledge, which We explained in detail, a guide and a mercy to all who believe.""But those who deny Our revelations and scorn them are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against God or rejects His Signs? When our messengers arrive to take their souls, they will say, 'Where are the things you used to invoke besides God?' They will reply, 'They have left us,' and they will bear witness against themselves that they had rejected God.

Such as took their religion to be mere amusement and play and were deceived by the life of the world. That day We shall forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and as they were wont to reject Our signs. We had certainly sent unto them a Book, based on knowledge, which We explained in detail, a guide and a mercy to all who believe."Certainly, we have brought them a Book which we have made clear with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.

Do they just wait for the final fulfillment of the event? On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say: "The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true tidings. Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back? Then should we behave differently from our behavior in the past." In fact, they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch.

Your Guardian-Lord is God, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne of authority. He draws the night as a veil over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession. He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, all governed by laws under His command. Is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed be God, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!

Call on your Lord with humility and in private, for God loves not those who trespass beyond bounds. Do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order, but call on Him with fear and longing in your hearts, for the mercy of God is always near to those who do good.

It is He Who sends the winds like heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy. When they have carried the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to a land that is dead, make rain to descend thereon, and produce every kind of harvest therewith. Thus shall We raise up the dead, perchance you may remember.

From the land that is clean and good, by the will of its Cherisher, springs up produce, rich after its kind. But from the land that is bad, springs up nothing but that which is niggardly. Thus do we explain the signs by various symbols to those who are grateful.

We sent Noah to his people. He said: "O my people! Worship God! You have no other god but Him. I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day!" The leaders of his people said: "Ah! We see you evidently wandering in mind." He said: "O my people! No wandering is there in my mind. On the contrary, I am a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds! I but fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord's mission. Sincere is my advice to you, and I know from God something that you know not."

Do you wonder that there has come to you a message from your Lord, through a man of your own people, to warn you, so that you may fear God and receive His mercy? But they rejected him, and We delivered him and those with him in the Ark. We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. They were indeed a blind people.

To the 'Ad people, We sent Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship God! You have no other god but Him. Will you not fear God?" The leaders of the unbelievers among his people said: "Ah! We see you are an imbecile and we think you are a liar!" He said: "O my people! I am no imbecile, but I am a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds! I but fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord's mission. I am to you a sincere and trustworthy adviser."

Do you wonder that there has come to you a message from your Lord through a man of your own people, to warn you? Call in remembrance that He made you inheritors after the people of Noah, and gave you a stature tall among the nations. Call in remembrance the benefits you have received from God, that you may prosper.

They said: "Have you come to us, that we may worship God alone, and give up the cult of our fathers? Bring us what you threaten us with, if you are telling the truth!" He said: "Punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your Lord. Do you dispute with me over names which you have devised, you and your fathers, without authority from God? Then wait, I am amongst you, also waiting."He said: "Indeed, uncleanness and wrath from your Lord have lighted upon you. Do you dispute with me about names which you and your fathers have given? God has not sent any authority for them. Wait then, I too will be among those who wait."

We saved him and those who adhered to him by Our mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and did not believe.

To the Thamud people, We sent Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. Now has come unto you a clear sign from your Lord! This she-camel of God is a sign unto you: so leave her to graze in God's earth, and let her come to no harm, or you shall be seized with a grievous punishment."

And remember how He made you inheritors after the 'Ad people and gave you habitations in the land: you build for yourselves palaces and castles in open plains, and carve out homes in the mountains. So bring to remembrance the benefits you have received from God, and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth.

The leaders of the arrogant party among his people said to those who were reckoned powerless, those among them who believed: "Do you indeed know that Salih is a messenger from his Lord?" They said: "We do indeed believe in the revelation which has been sent through him."

The arrogant party said: "For our part, we reject what you believe in."

Then they hamstrung the she-camel and insolently defied the order of their Lord, saying: "O Salih! Bring about your threats if you are a messenger of God!"

So the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes in the morning.

So Salih left them, saying: "O my people! I did indeed convey to you the message for which I was sent by my Lord. I gave you good counsel, but you love not good counselors!"

We also sent Lut. He said to his people: "Do you commit lewdness such as no people in creation ever committed before you? For you practice your lusts on men in preference to women. You are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds."

And his people gave no answer but this: they said, "Drive them out of your city. These are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!"

But We saved him and his family, except his wife; she was of those who lagged behind.

And We rained down on them a shower of brimstone. Then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!

To the Madyan people, We sent Shu'aib, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. Now has come unto you a clear sign from your Lord! Give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due; and do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order. That will be best for you if you have faith."

And do not lie in wait on every road, threatening and turning away from God's path those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. Remember when you were few, then He multiplied you, and consider what was the end of the mischief-makers.

And if there is a party among you who believes in the message with which I have been sent, and a party which does not believe, hold yourselves in patience until God decides between us, for He is the best to decide.

The leaders, the arrogant party among his people, said: "O Shu'aib! We shall certainly drive you out of our city, you and those who believe with you, or else you shall have to return to our ways and religion." He said: "What! Even though we detest them?"

We should indeed invent a lie against God if we returned to your ways after God has rescued us from them. Nor could we by any means return thereto unless it be as in the will and plan of God, our Lord. Our Lord can reach out to the utmost recesses of things by His knowledge. In God is our trust. Our Lord! Decide between us and our people in truth, for You are the best to decide.The leaders, the unbelievers among his people, said: "If you follow Shu'aib, you will be ruined!" But the earthquake took them by surprise, and they lay prostrate in their homes by morning. Those who rejected Shu'aib became as if they had never lived there; they were the losers. Shu'aib left them, saying: "O my people! I conveyed the messages from my Lord and gave you good counsel, but how can I lament over a people who refuse to believe?"

Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We afflicted its people with suffering and adversity so they might learn humility. Then We changed their suffering into prosperity until they grew and multiplied, saying: "Our fathers also faced suffering and affluence." Then We seized them suddenly, while they were unaware.

If the people of the towns had believed and feared God, We would have opened blessings from heaven and earth for them. But they rejected the truth, so We brought them to account for their misdeeds. Did they feel secure against Our wrath coming by night while they slept, or by day while they played? No one can feel secure from God's plan except those doomed to ruin.

To those who inherit the earth after its previous possessors, is it not a lesson that We could punish them for their sins and seal their hearts so they could not hear? Such were the towns whose stories We relate to you. Their messengers came with clear signs, but they would not believe what they had previously rejected. Thus, God seals the hearts of those who reject faith.

Most of them were not true to their covenant; most were rebellious and disobedient. After them, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See the end of those who made mischief. Moses said: "O Pharaoh! I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds, one who speaks the truth about God. I have come with a clear sign from your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with me."

Pharaoh said: "If you have a sign, show it if you are truthful." Moses threw his rod, and it became a serpent. He drew out his hand, and it was white to all beholders. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: "This is a knowledgeable sorcerer who plans to expel you from your land. What do you advise?" They said: "Keep him and his brother in suspense and send men to collect all the sorcerers."

The sorcerers came to Pharaoh and said, "We shall have a reward if we win!" Pharaoh said: "Yes, and you will be among those nearest to me." They said to Moses: "Will you throw first, or shall we?" Moses said: "Throw." When they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them, showing a great feat of magic. We inspired Moses: "Throw your rod," and it swallowed up all the falsehoods they faked.Certainly, here is the processed content:

---

And certainly We have brought them a Book which We have made clear with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.

Do they just wait for the final fulfillment of the event? On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say: "The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true tidings. Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back? Then should we behave differently from our behavior in the past." In fact, they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch.

Await they aught save the fulfillment thereof? On the day when the fulfillment thereof cometh, those who were before forgetful thereof will say: The messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth! Have we any intercessors, that they may intercede for us? Or can we be returned to life on earth, that we may act otherwise than we used to act? They have lost their souls, and that which they devised hath failed them.

Do they wait for aught but its final sequel? On the day when its final sequel comes about, those who neglected it before will say: Indeed the messengers of our Lord brought the truth; are there for us then any intercessors so that they should intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back so that we should do deeds other than those which we did? Indeed they have lost their souls and that which they forged has gone away from them.

Your Guardian-Lord is God, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne of authority: He draweth the night as a veil over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession: He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, all governed by laws under His command. Is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed be God, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!

Lo! your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then mounted He the Throne. He covereth the night with the day, which is in haste to follow it, and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by His command. His verily is all creation and commandment. Blessed be God, the Lord of the Worlds!

Surely your Lord is God, Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time, and He is firm in power; He throws the veil of night over the day, which it pursues incessantly; and He created the sun and the moon and the stars, made subservient by His command; surely His is the creation and the command; blessed is God, the Lord of the worlds.

Call on your Lord with humility and in private: for God loveth not those who trespass beyond bounds.

Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret. Lo! He loveth not aggressors.

Call on your Lord humbly and secretly; surely He does not love those who exceed the limits.

Do no mischief on the earth, after it hath been set in order, but call on Him with fear and longing in your hearts: for the Mercy of God is always near to those who do good.

Work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering thereof, and call on Him in fear and hope. Lo! the mercy of God is nigh unto the good.

And do not make mischief in the earth after its reformation, and call on Him fearing and hoping; surely the mercy of God is nigh to those who do good to others.

It is He Who sendeth the winds like heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy: when they have carried the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to a land that is dead, make rain to descend thereon, and produce every kind of harvest therewith: thus shall We raise up the dead: perchance ye may remember.

And He it is Who sendeth the winds as tidings heralding His mercy, till, when they bear a cloud heavy with rain, We lead it to a dead land, and then cause water to descend thereon and thereby bring forth fruits of every kind. Thus bring We forth the dead. Haply ye may remember.

And He it is Who sends forth the winds bearing good news before His mercy, until, when they bring up a laden cloud, We drive it to a dead land, then We send down water on it, then bring forth with it fruits of all kinds; thus shall We bring forth the dead that you may be mindful.

From the land that is clean and good, by the will of its Cherisher, springs up produce, rich after its kind: but from the land that is bad, springs up nothing but that which is niggardly: thus do we explain the signs by various symbols to those who are grateful.

As for the good land, its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its Lord; while as for that which is bad, only the useless cometh forth from it. Thus do We recount the tokens for people who give thanks.

And as for the good land, its vegetation springs forth abundantly by the permission of its Lord, and as for that which is inferior, its herbage comes forth but scantily; thus do We repeat the communications for a people who give thanks.

We sent Noah to his people. He said: "O my people! worship God! ye have no other god but Him. I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day!"

We sent Noah of old unto his people, and he said: O my people! Serve God. Ye have no other God save Him. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an Awful Day.

Certainly We sent Nuh to his people, so he said: O my people! serve God, you have no god other than Him; surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day.

The leaders of his people said: "Ah! we see thee evidently wandering in mind."

The chieftains of his people said: Lo! we see thee surely in plain error.

The chiefs of his people said: Most surely we see you in clear error.

He said: "O my people! No wandering is there in my mind: on the contrary I am a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds!"

He said: O my people! There is no error in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.

He said: O my people! there is no error in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds.

"I but fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord's mission: Sincere is my advice to you, and I know from God something that ye know not."

I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and give good counsel unto you, and know from God that which ye know not.

I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, and I offer you good advice and I know from God what you do not know.

"Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord, through a man of your own people, to warn you, so that ye may fear God and haply receive His Mercy?"

Marvel ye that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by means of a man among you, that he may warn you, and that ye may keep from evil, and that haply ye may find mercy.

What! do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you, that he might warn you and that you might guard against evil and so that mercy may be shown to you?

But they rejected him, and We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark: but We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. They were indeed a blind people!

But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and We drowned those who denied Our tokens. Lo! they were blind folk.

But they called him a liar, so We delivered him and those with him in the ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our communications; surely they were a blind people.

To the 'Ad people, We sent Hud, one of their own brethren: He said: "O my people! worship God! ye have no other god but Him. Will ye not fear God?"

And unto the tribe of A'ad We sent their brother, Hud. He said: O my people! Serve God. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off evil?

And to Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said: O my people! serve God, you have no god other than Him; will you not then guard against evil?

The leaders of the Unbelievers among his people said: "Ah! we see thou art an imbecile!" and "We think thou art a liar!"

The chieftains of his people, who were disbelieving, said: Lo! we surely see thee in foolishness, and lo! we deem thee of the liars.

The chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said: Most surely we see you in folly, and most surely we think you to be of the liars.

He said: "O my people! I am no imbecile, but I am a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds!"

He said: O my people! There is no foolishness in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.

He said: O my people! there is no folly in me, but I am a messenger of the Lord of the worlds.

"I but fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord's mission: I am to you a sincere and trustworthy adviser."

I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and am for you a true adviser.

I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I am a faithful adviser to you.

"Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord through a man of your own people, to warn you? Call in remembrance that He made you inheritors after the people of Noah, and gave you a stature tall among the nations. Call in remembrance the benefits ye have received from God: that so ye may prosper."

Marvel ye that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by means of a man among you, that he may warn you? Remember how He made you viceroys after Noah's folk, and gave you growth of stature. Remember all the bounties of your Lord, that haply ye may be successful.

What! do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you that he might warn you? And remember when He made you successors after Nuh's people and increased you in excellence in respect of make; therefore remember the benefits of God, that you may be successful.

They said: "Comest thou to us, that we may worship God alone, and give up the cult of our fathers? Bring us what thou threatenest us with, if so be that thou tellest the truth!"

They said: Hast come unto us that we should serve God alone, and forsake what our fathers worshipped? Then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful!

They said: Have you come to us that we may serve God alone and give up what our fathers used to serve? Then bring to us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones.

He said: "Punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your Lord: dispute ye with me over names which ye have devised - ye and your fathers - without authority from God? Then wait: I am amongst you, also waiting."

He said: Terror and wrath from your Lord have already fallen on you. Would ye wrangle with me over names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which no warrant from God hath been revealed? Then await the consequence, lo! I

Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect. So the truth was established, and what they did became null. So the great ones were vanquished there and then, and were made to look small. Thus they were defeated and brought low. But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration, saying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron. Pharaoh said: Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this is a trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out its people: but soon shall ye know the consequences. Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross. They said: For us, we are but sent back unto our Lord. But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the Signs of our Lord when they reached us! Our Lord! pour out on us patience and constancy, and take our souls unto thee as Muslims who bow to thy will. Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people: Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods? He said: Their male children will we slay; only their females will we save alive; and we have over them power irresistible. Said Moses to his people: Pray for help from God, and wait in patience and constancy: for the earth is God's, to give as a heritage to such of His servants as He pleaseth; and the end is best for the righteous. They said: We have had nothing but trouble, both before and after thou camest to us. He said: It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth; that so He may try you by your deeds. We punished the people of Pharaoh with years of droughts and shortness of crops; that they might receive admonition. But when good times came, they said, This is due to us; When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in God's sight, but most of them do not understand! They said to Moses: Whatever be the Signs thou bringest, to work therewith thy sorcery on us, we shall never believe in thee. So We sent plagues on them: Wholesale death, Locusts, Lice, Frogs, and Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance, a people given to sin. Every time the penalty fell on them, they said: O Moses! on your behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee: If thou wilt remove the penalty from us, we shall truly believe in thee, and we shall send away the Children of Israel with thee. But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfill, behold! they broke their word! So We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them. And We made a people, considered weak and of no account, inheritors of lands in both east and west, lands whereon We sent down Our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy, and We leveled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected with such pride. We took the Children of Israel with safety across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had. They said: O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have. He said: Surely ye are a people without knowledge. As to these folk, the cult they are in is but a fragment of a ruin, and vain is the worship which they practice. He said: Shall I seek for you a god other than the true God, when it is God Who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations? And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with the worst of penalties, who slew your male children and saved alive your females: in that was a momentous trial from your Lord."He said: "Indeed, uncleanness and wrath from your Lord have lighted upon you. Do you dispute with me about names which you and your fathers have given, for which God has sent no authority? Wait then, I too will be among those who wait."

We saved him and those who adhered to him by Our mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and did not believe.

To the Thamud people, We sent Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. Now has come to you a clear sign from your Lord. This she-camel of God is a sign to you, so leave her to graze in God's earth and do her no harm, or you shall be seized with a grievous punishment."

And remember how He made you inheritors after the 'Ad people and gave you habitations in the land. You build for yourselves palaces and castles in open plains and carve out homes in the mountains. So remember the benefits you have received from God and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth.

The leaders of the arrogant party among his people said to those who were reckoned powerless, those among them who believed: "Do you indeed know that Salih is a messenger from his Lord?" They said: "We do indeed believe in the revelation sent through him."

The arrogant party said: "For our part, we reject what you believe in."

Then they hamstrung the she-camel and insolently defied the order of their Lord, saying: "O Salih! Bring about your threats if you are a messenger of God!"

So the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes in the morning.

Salih left them, saying: "O my people! I did indeed convey to you the message for which I was sent by my Lord. I gave you good counsel, but you do not love good counselors."

We also sent Lut. He said to his people: "Do you commit lewdness such as no people in creation ever committed before you? You practice your lusts on men in preference to women. You are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds."

And his people gave no answer but this: they said, "Drive them out of your city. These are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!"

But We saved him and his family, except his wife; she was of those who lagged behind.

And We rained down on them a shower of brimstone. See what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!

To the Madyan people, We sent Shu'aib, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. Now has come to you a clear sign from your Lord. Give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due. Do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order. That will be best for you if you have faith."

And do not lie in wait on every road, threatening and hindering from the path of God those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. Remember how you were few, and He gave you increase. Consider the end of those who did mischief.

And if there is a party among you who believes in the message with which I have been sent, and a party which does not believe, hold yourselves in patience until God decides between us, for He is the best to decide.

The leaders, the arrogant party among his people, said: "O Shu'aib! We shall certainly drive you out of our city, you and those who believe with you, or else you shall have to return to our ways and religion." He said: "What! Even though we detest them?"

We should indeed invent a lie against God if we returned to your ways after God has rescued us from them. Nor could we by any means return to them unless it be as in the will and plan of God, our Lord. Our Lord comprehends all things in knowledge. In God is our trust. Our Lord! Decide between us and our people in truth, for You are the best to decide.The leaders, the unbelievers among his people, said: "If you follow Shu'aib, you will be ruined!" But the earthquake took them by surprise, and they lay prostrate in their homes by morning. Those who rejected Shu'aib became as if they had never lived there; they were the losers. Shu'aib said: "O my people! I conveyed the messages from my Lord and gave you good counsel, but how can I lament over a people who refuse to believe?"

Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We afflicted its people with suffering and adversity so they might learn humility. Then We changed their suffering into prosperity until they grew and multiplied, saying: "Our fathers also faced suffering and affluence." Then We seized them suddenly, while they were unaware.

If the people of the towns had believed and feared God, We would have opened blessings from heaven and earth for them. But they rejected the truth, so We punished them for their misdeeds. Did the people of the towns feel secure against Our wrath coming by night while they slept, or by day while they played? No one can feel secure from God's plan except those doomed to ruin.

To those who inherit the earth after its previous possessors, is it not a lesson that We could punish them for their sins and seal their hearts so they could not hear? Such were the towns whose stories We relate to you. Their messengers came with clear signs, but they would not believe what they had previously rejected. Thus, God seals the hearts of those who reject faith.

Most of them were not true to their covenant; most were rebellious and disobedient. After them, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See the end of those who made mischief. Moses said: "O Pharaoh! I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds, one who speaks the truth about God. I have come with a clear sign from your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with me."

Pharaoh said: "If you have a sign, show it if you are truthful." Moses threw his rod, and it became a serpent. He drew out his hand, and it was white to all beholders. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: "This is a knowledgeable sorcerer who intends to expel you from your land. What do you advise?" They said: "Keep him and his brother in suspense and send men to collect all the sorcerers."

The sorcerers came to Pharaoh and asked for a reward if they won. Pharaoh promised them rewards and positions close to him. They asked Moses if he would throw first or if they should. Moses told them to throw first. They bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them with their magic. We inspired Moses to throw his rod, and it swallowed up all their falsehoods.saying: "Cast your rod," then it devoured the lies they told. Thus, truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect. So the great ones were vanquished and made to look small. The sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration, saying: "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron."

Pharaoh said: "Believe in Him before I give you permission? This is a trick to drive out its people, but soon you shall know the consequences. I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you all." They said: "We are but sent back to our Lord. You wreak vengeance on us because we believed in the Signs of our Lord. Our Lord, pour out patience and constancy on us and take our souls as Muslims."

The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: "Will you leave Moses and his people to spread mischief and abandon you and your gods?" He said: "We will slay their male children and save their females; we have power over them." Moses said to his people: "Pray for help from God and wait in patience. The earth is God's to give as a heritage to His servants, and the end is best for the righteous." They said: "We have had trouble before and after you came to us." He said: "It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth to try you by your deeds."

We punished the people of Pharaoh with years of droughts and shortness of crops to receive admonition. But when good times came, they said, "This is due to us;" when gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses. In truth, the omens of evil are theirs in God's sight, but most do not understand. They said to Moses: "Whatever signs you bring to work your sorcery, we shall never believe in you." So We sent plagues: death, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood, clear signs, but they were arrogant and sinful.

Every time the penalty fell on them, they said: "O Moses, call on your Lord to remove the penalty, and we shall believe and send away the Children of Israel with you." But when We removed the penalty, they broke their word. So We exacted retribution and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning. We made a people considered weak inheritors of lands in both east and west, lands blessed by Us. The fair promise of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they had patience and constancy. We leveled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected with pride.

We took the Children of Israel across the sea. They came upon a people devoted to idols and said: "O Moses, fashion for us a god like theirs." He said: "You are a people without knowledge. Their cult is a fragment of a ruin, and vain is their worship." He said: "Shall I seek for you a god other than God when He has endowed you with gifts above the nations? Remember, We rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with the worst penalties, who slew your male children and saved alive your females. In that was a momentous trial from your Lord."", slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. That was a tremendous trial from your Lord. And when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord. We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed the period with ten more: thus was completed the term of communion with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron before he went up: 'Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief.' And when We did appoint for Moses thirty nights of solitude, and added to them ten, and he completed the whole time appointed by his Lord of forty nights; and Moses said unto his brother, Aaron: 'Take my place among the people. Do right, and follow not the way of mischief-makers.' And We appointed with Moses a time of thirty nights and completed them with ten more, so the appointed time of his Lord was complete forty nights, and Moses said to his brother Aaron: 'Take my place among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers.' When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, He said: 'O my Lord! show Thyself to me, that I may look upon Thee.' God said: 'By no means canst thou see Me direct; But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me.' When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: 'Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.' And when Moses came to Our appointed tryst and his Lord had spoken unto him, he said: 'My Lord! Show me Thy Self, that I may gaze upon Thee.' He said: 'Thou wilt not see Me, but gaze upon the mountain! If it stand still in its place, then thou wilt see Me.' And when his Lord revealed His glory to the mountain He sent it crashing down. And Moses fell down senseless. And when he woke he said: 'Glory unto Thee! I turn unto Thee repentant, and I am the first of true believers.' He said: 'O Moses! I have chosen thee above other men, by the mission I have given thee and the words I have spoken to thee: take then the revelation which I give thee, and be of those who give thanks.' He said: 'O Moses! I have preferred thee above mankind by My messages and by My speaking unto thee. So hold that which I have given thee, and be among the thankful.' He said: 'O Moses! surely I have chosen you above the people with My messages and with My words, therefore take hold of what I give to you and be of the grateful ones.' And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters, both commanding and explaining all things, and said: 'Take and hold these with firmness, and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts: soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked, how they lie desolate.' And We wrote for him, upon the tablets, the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation of all things, then bade him: 'Hold it fast; and command thy people saying: Take the better course made clear therein. I shall show thee the abode of evil-livers.' And We ordained for him in the tablets admonition of every kind and clear explanation of all things; so take hold of them with firmness and enjoin your people to take hold of what is best thereof; I will show you the abode of the transgressors. Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My signs: Even if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct, they will not adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error, that is the way they will adopt. For they have rejected our signs, and failed to take warning from them. I shall turn away from My revelations those who magnify themselves wrongfully in the earth, and if they see each token believe it not, and if they see the way of righteousness choose it not for their way, and if they see the way of error choose it for their way. That is because they deny Our revelations and are used to disregard them. I will turn away from My communications those who are unjustly proud in the earth; and if they see every sign they will not believe in It; and if they see the way of rectitude they do not take It for a way, and if they see the way of error, they take it for a way; this is because they rejected Our communications and were heedless of them. Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter, vain are their deeds: Can they expect to be rewarded except as they have wrought? Those who deny Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter, their works are fruitless. Are they requited aught save what they used to do? And as to those who reject Our communications and the meeting of the hereafter, their deeds are null. Shall they be rewarded except for what they have done? The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the image of a calf, for worship: it seemed to low: did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship and they did wrong. And the folk of Moses, after he left them, chose a calf for worship, made out of their ornaments, of saffron hue, which gave a lowing sound. Saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way? They chose it, and became wrong-doers. And Moses's people made of their ornaments a calf after him, a mere body, which gave a mooing sound. What! could they not see that it did not speak to them nor guide them in the way? They took it for worship and they were unjust. When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said: 'If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us, we shall indeed be of those who perish.' And when they feared the consequences thereof and saw that they had gone astray, they said: 'Unless our Lord have mercy on us and forgive us, we verily are of the lost.' And when they repented and saw that they had gone astray, they said: 'If our Lord show not mercy to us and forgive us we shall certainly be of the losers.' When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: 'Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?' He put down the tablets, seized his brother by the hair of his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: 'Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.' And when Moses returned unto his people, angry and grieved, he said: 'Evil is that course which ye took after I had left you. Would ye hasten on the judgment of your Lord?' And he cast down the tablets, and he seized his brother by the head, dragging him toward him. He said: 'Son of my mother! Lo! the folk did judge me weak and almost killed me. Oh, make not mine enemies to triumph over me and place me not among the evil-doers.' And when Moses returned to his people, wrathful and in violent grief, he said: 'Evil is it that you have done after me; did you turn away from the bidding of your Lord?' And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. He said: 'Son of my mother! surely the people reckoned me weak and had well-nigh slain me, therefore make not the enemies to rejoice over me and count me not among the unjust people.' Moses prayed: 'O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy! for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!' He said: 'My Lord! Have mercy on me and on my brother; bring us into Thy mercy, Thou the Most Merciful of all who show mercy.' He said: 'My Lord! forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Thy mercy, and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful ones.' Those who took the calf for worship will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord, and with shame in this life: thus do We recompense those who invent falsehoods. Lo! Those who chose the calf for worship, terror from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world. Thus do We requite those who invent a lie. As for those who took the calf for a god, surely wrath from their Lord and disgrace in this world's life shall overtake them, and thus do We recompense the devisers of lies. But those who do wrong but repent thereafter and truly believe, verily thy Lord is thereafter Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. But those who do ill-deeds and afterward repent and believe - lo! for them, afterward, God is Forgiving, Merciful. And as to those who do evil deeds, then repent after that and believe, your Lord after that is most surely Forgiving, Merciful. When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the tablets: in the writing thereon was guidance and Mercy for such as fear their Lord. Then, when the anger of Moses abated, he took up the tablets, and in their inscription there was guidance and mercy for all those who fear their Lord. And when Moses's anger calmed down he took up the tablets, and in the writing thereof was guidance and mercy for those who fear for the sake of their Lord. And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: 'O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the best of those who forgive.' And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when the trembling came on them, he said: 'My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did? It is but Thy trial of us. Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness.' And Moses chose out of his people seventy men for Our appoint"When the earthquake overtook them, Moses said: "My Lord! If Thou hadst pleased, Thou hadst destroyed them before and myself too; wilt Thou destroy us for what the fools among us have done? It is naught but Thy trial, Thou makest err with it whom Thou pleasest and guidest whom Thou pleasest: Thou art our Guardian, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the forgivers."

"And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the Hereafter: for we have turned unto Thee." He said: "With My punishment I visit whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who do right, and practice regular charity, and those who believe in Our signs."

"Those who follow the messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own scriptures, in the law and the Gospel; for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good and pure and prohibits them from what is bad and impure; He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him, it is they who will prosper."

Say: "O men! I am sent unto you all, as the Messenger of God, to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there is no god but He: it is He That giveth both life and death. So believe in God and His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, who believeth in God and His words: follow him that ye may be guided."

Of the people of Moses, there is a section who guide and do justice in the light of truth. We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his thirsty people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you": but they rebelled; to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.

And remember it was said to them: "Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase the portion of those who do good." But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them, so We sent on them a plague from heaven for that they repeatedly transgressed.

Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.

When some of them said: "Why do ye preach to a people whom God will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?" said the preachers: "To discharge our duty to your Lord, and perchance they may fear Him." When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression.

When in their insolence they transgressed all prohibitions, We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected." Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment, those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn to Us. After them succeeded an evil generation: They inherited the Book, but they chose for themselves the vanities of this world, saying for excuse: "Everything will be forgiven us.""Even so, if similar vanities came their way, they would again seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to God anything but the truth? They study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will you not understand?

A generation succeeded them who inherited the scriptures. They grasp the goods of this low life as the price of evil-doing and say: 'It will be forgiven us.' If there came to them again the offer of the like, they would accept it and sin again. Has not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak anything concerning God save the truth? They have studied what is therein. The abode of the Hereafter is better for those who ward off evil. Have you then no sense?

As for those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer, never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.

When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them, We said: 'Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring to remembrance what is therein; perchance you may fear God.'

When your Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam their descendants and made them testify concerning themselves, saying: 'Am I not your Lord?' They said: 'Yes, we do testify!' This, lest you should say on the Day of Judgment: 'Of this we were never mindful.'

Or lest you should say: 'Our fathers before us may have taken false gods, but we are their descendants after them: will You then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were futile?'

Thus do We explain the signs in detail; perchance they may turn unto Us.

Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray. If it had been Our will, We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he inclined to the earth and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue, or if you leave him alone, he still lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs; so relate the story; perchance they may reflect.

Evil as an example are people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls. Whom God guides, he is on the right path; whom He rejects from His guidance, such are the persons who perish.

Many are the jinns and men We have made for Hell: they have hearts wherewith they understand not, eyes wherewith they see not, and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle, nay more misguided, for they are heedless of warning.

The most beautiful names belong to God: so call on Him by them; but shun such men as use profanity in His names: for what they do, they will soon be requited.

Of those We have created are people who direct others with truth and dispense justice therewith.

Those who reject Our signs, We shall gradually visit with punishment, in ways they perceive not. Respite will I grant unto them, for My scheme is strong and unfailing.

Do they not reflect? Their companion is not seized with madness; he is but a perspicuous warner. Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth and all that God has created? Do they not see that it may well be that their term is nigh drawing to an end? In what message after this will they then believe?

To such as God rejects from His guidance, there can be no guide: He will leave them in their trespasses, wandering in distraction.

They ask you about the final Hour - when will be its appointed time? Say: 'The knowledge thereof is with my Lord alone: none but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only, all of a sudden will it come to you.' They ask you as if you were eager in search thereof: say: 'The knowledge thereof is with God alone, but most men know not.'"", slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. That was a tremendous trial from your Lord. And when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord. We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed the period with ten more: thus was completed the term of communion with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron before he went up: 'Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief.' And when We did appoint for Moses thirty nights of solitude, and added to them ten, he completed the whole time appointed by his Lord of forty nights; and Moses said unto his brother, Aaron: 'Take my place among the people. Do right, and follow not the way of mischief-makers.' And We appointed with Moses a time of thirty nights and completed them with ten more, so the appointed time of his Lord was complete forty nights, and Moses said to his brother Aaron: 'Take my place among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers.' When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, he said: 'O my Lord! show Thyself to me, that I may look upon Thee.' God said: 'By no means canst thou see Me direct; But look upon the mount; if it abides in its place, then shalt thou see Me.' When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: 'Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.' And when Moses came to Our appointed tryst and his Lord had spoken unto him, he said: 'My Lord! Show me Thyself, that I may gaze upon Thee.' He said: 'Thou wilt not see Me, but gaze upon the mountain! If it stands still in its place, then thou wilt see Me.' And when his Lord revealed His glory to the mountain He sent it crashing down. And Moses fell down senseless. And when he woke he said: 'Glory unto Thee! I turn unto Thee repentant, and I am the first of true believers.' He said: 'O Moses! I have chosen thee above other men, by the mission I have given thee and the words I have spoken to thee: take then the revelation which I give thee, and be of those who give thanks.' He said: 'O Moses! I have preferred thee above mankind by My messages and by My speaking unto thee. So hold that which I have given thee, and be among the thankful.' He said: 'O Moses! surely I have chosen you above the people with My messages and with My words, therefore take hold of what I give to you and be of the grateful ones.' And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters, both commanding and explaining all things, and said: 'Take and hold these with firmness, and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts: soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked, how they lie desolate.' And We wrote for him, upon the tablets, the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation of all things, then bade him: 'Hold it fast; and command thy people saying: Take the better course made clear therein. I shall show thee the abode of evil-livers.' And We ordained for him in the tablets admonition of every kind and clear explanation of all things; so take hold of them with firmness and enjoin your people to take hold of what is best thereof; I will show you the abode of the transgressors. Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My signs: Even if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct, they will not adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error, that is the way they will adopt. For they have rejected our signs, and failed to take warning from them. I shall turn away from My revelations those who magnify themselves wrongfully in the earth, and if they see each token believe it not, and if they see the way of righteousness choose it not for their way, and if they see the way of error choose it for their way. That is because they deny Our revelations and are used to disregard them. I will turn away from My communications those who are unjustly proud in the earth; and if they see every sign they will not believe in It; and if they see the way of rectitude they do not take It for a way, and if they see the way of error, they take it for a way; this is because they rejected Our communications and were heedless of them. Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter, vain are their deeds: Can they expect to be rewarded except as they have wrought? Those who deny Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter, their works are fruitless. Are they requited aught save what they used to do? And as to those who reject Our communications and the meeting of the hereafter, their deeds are null. Shall they be rewarded except for what they have done? The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the image of a calf, for worship: it seemed to low: did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship and they did wrong. And the folk of Moses, after he left them, chose a calf for worship, made out of their ornaments, of saffron hue, which gave a lowing sound. Saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way? They chose it, and became wrong-doers. And Moses' people made of their ornaments a calf after him, a mere body, which gave a mooing sound. What! could they not see that it did not speak to them nor guide them in the way? They took it for worship and they were unjust. When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said: 'If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us, we shall indeed be of those who perish.' And when they feared the consequences thereof and saw that they had gone astray, they said: 'Unless our Lord have mercy on us and forgive us, we verily are of the lost.' And when they repented and saw that they had gone astray, they said: 'If our Lord show not mercy to us and forgive us we shall certainly be of the losers.' When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: 'Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?' He put down the tablets, seized his brother by the hair of his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: 'Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.' And when Moses returned unto his people, angry and grieved, he said: 'Evil is that course which ye took after I had left you. Would ye hasten on the judgment of your Lord?' And he cast down the tablets, and he seized his brother by the head, dragging him toward him. He said: 'Son of my mother! Lo! the folk did judge me weak and almost killed me. Oh, make not mine enemies to triumph over me and place me not among the evil-doers.' And when Moses returned to his people, wrathful and in violent grief, he said: 'Evil is it that you have done after me; did you turn away from the bidding of your Lord?' And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. He said: 'Son of my mother! surely the people reckoned me weak and had well-nigh slain me, therefore make not the enemies to rejoice over me and count me not among the unjust people.' Moses prayed: 'O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy! for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!' He said: 'My Lord! Have mercy on me and on my brother; bring us into Thy mercy, Thou the Most Merciful of all who show mercy.' He said: 'My Lord! forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Thy mercy, and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful ones.' Those who took the calf for worship will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord, and with shame in this life: thus do We recompense those who invent falsehoods. Lo! Those who chose the calf for worship, terror from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world. Thus do We requite those who invent a lie. As for those who took the calf for a god, surely wrath from their Lord and disgrace in this world's life shall overtake them, and thus do We recompense the devisers of lies. But those who do wrong but repent thereafter and truly believe, verily thy Lord is thereafter Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. But those who do ill-deeds and afterward repent and believe - lo! for them, afterward, God is Forgiving, Merciful. And as to those who do evil deeds, then repent after that and believe, your Lord after that is most surely Forgiving, Merciful. When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the tablets: in the writing thereon was guidance and Mercy for such as fear their Lord. Then, when the anger of Moses abated, he took up the tablets, and in their inscription there was guidance and mercy for all those who fear their Lord. And when Moses' anger calmed down he took up the tablets, and in the writing thereof was guidance and mercy for those who fear for the sake of their Lord. And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: 'O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the best of those who forgive.' And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when the trembling came on them, he said: 'My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did? It is but Thy trial of us. Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness.' And Moses chose out of his people seventy men for Our appoint""It will not come on you but all of a sudden. They ask you as if you were solicitous about it. Say: Its knowledge is only with God, but most people do not know. Say: 'I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as God wills. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I should have multiplied all good, and no evil should have touched me: I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith.' Say: 'For myself I have no power to benefit, nor power to hurt, save that which God wills. Had I knowledge of the Unseen, I should have abundance of wealth, and adversity would not touch me. I am but a warner, and a bearer of good tidings unto folk who believe.' Say: 'I do not control any benefit or harm for my own soul except as God pleases; and had I known the unseen I would have had much good and no evil would have touched me; I am nothing but a warner and the giver of good news to a people who believe.' It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love. When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about unnoticed. When she grows heavy, they both pray to God their Lord, saying: 'If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall ever be grateful.' But when He gives them a goodly child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received: but God is Exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him. Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created? No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves! If you call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether you call them or you hold your peace! Verily those whom you call upon besides God are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if you are indeed truthful! Have they feet to walk with? Or hands to lay hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say: 'Call your god-partners, scheme your worst against me, and give me no respite!' For my Protector is God, Who revealed the Book from time to time, and He will choose and befriend the righteous. But those you call upon besides Him are unable to help you, and indeed to help themselves. If you call them to guidance, they hear not. You will see them looking at you, but they see not. Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant. If a suggestion from Satan assails your mind, seek refuge with God; for He hears and knows all things. Those who fear God, when a thought of evil from Satan assaults them, bring God to remembrance, when lo! they see aright! But their brethren the evil ones plunge them deeper into error, and never relax their efforts. If you bring them not a revelation, they say: 'Why have you not got it together?' Say: 'I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord: this is nothing but lights from your Lord, and Guidance, and mercy, for any who have faith.' When the Qur'an is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace: that you may receive Mercy. And do you bring your Lord to remembrance in your very soul, with humility and in reverence, without loudness in words, in the mornings and evenings; and be not of those who are unheedful. Those who are near to your Lord, disdain not to do Him worship: They celebrate His praises, and prostrate before Him."When the earthquake overtook them, Moses said: "My Lord! If Thou hadst pleased, Thou hadst destroyed them before and myself too; wilt Thou destroy us for what the fools among us have done? It is naught but Thy trial, Thou makest err with it whom Thou pleasest and guidest whom Thou pleasest: Thou art our Guardian, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the forgivers."

"And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the Hereafter: for we have turned unto Thee." He said: "With My punishment I visit whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That mercy I shall ordain for those who do right, practice regular charity, and believe in Our signs."

"Those who follow the messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own scriptures, in the law and the Gospel; for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good and prohibits them from what is bad; He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him, it is they who will prosper."

Say: "O men! I am sent unto you all, as the Messenger of God, to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there is no god but He: it is He That giveth both life and death. So believe in God and His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, who believeth in God and His words: follow him that ye may be guided."

Of the people of Moses, there is a section who guide and do justice in the light of truth. We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you": but they rebelled; to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.

And remember it was said to them: "Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase the portion of those who do good." But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them so we sent on them a plague from heaven for that they repeatedly transgressed.

Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.

When some of them said: "Why do ye preach to a people whom God will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?" said the preachers: "To discharge our duty to your Lord, and perchance they may fear Him." When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression.

When in their insolence they transgressed all prohibitions, We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected." Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment, those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn to us. After them succeeded an evil generation: They inherited the Book, but they chose for themselves the vanities of this world, saying for excuse: "Everything will be forgiven us.""Even as your Lord caused you to go forth from your house with the truth, though a party of the believers were surely averse; 008.006 Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest, as if they were being driven to death and they saw it. 008.007 Behold! God promised you one of the two enemy parties, that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but God willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers; 008.008 That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false, distasteful though it be to those in guilt. 008.009 Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord, and He answered you: 'I will assist you with a thousand of the angels, ranks on ranks.' 008.010 God made it but a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts: there is no help except from God: and God is Exalted in Power, Wise. 008.011 Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness, to give you calm as from Himself, and He caused rain to descend on you from heaven, to clean you therewith, to remove from you the stain of Satan, to strengthen your hearts, and to plant your feet firmly therewith. 008.012 Remember thy Lord inspired the angels with the message: 'I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them.' 008.013 This because they contended against God and His Messenger: If any contend against God and His Messenger, God is strict in punishment. 008.014 Thus will it be said: 'Taste ye then of the punishment: for those who resist God, is the penalty of the Fire.' 008.015 O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them. 008.016 If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop of his own - he draws on himself the wrath of God, and his abode is Hell, an evil refuge indeed! 008.017 It is not ye who slew them; it was God: when thou threwest a handful of dust, it was not thy act, but God's: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for God is He Who heareth and knoweth all things. 008.018 That, and also because God is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers. 008.019 O Unbelievers! if ye prayed for victory and judgment, now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist from wrong, it will be best for you: if ye return to the attack, so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied: for verily God is with those who believe! 008.020 O ye who believe! Obey God and His Messenger, and turn not away from him when ye hear him speak. 008.021 Nor be like those who say, 'We hear,' but listen not: 008.022 For the worst of beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb, those who understand not. 008.023 If God had found in them any good, He would indeed have made them listen: as it is, if He had made them listen, they would but have turned back and declined Faith. 008.024 O ye who believe! give your response to God and His Messenger, when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that God cometh in between a man and his heart, and that it is He to Whom ye shall all be gathered. 008.025 And fear tumult or oppression, which affecteth not in particular only those of you who do wrong: and know that God is strict in punishment. 008.026 Call to mind when ye were a small band, despised through the land, and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; But He provided a safe asylum for you, strengthened you with His aid, and gave you Good things for sustenance: that ye might be grateful. 008.027 O ye that believe! betray not the trust of God and the Messenger, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you.""Even so, if similar vanities came their way, they would seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to God anything but the truth? They study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will you not understand?

A generation succeeded them who inherited the scriptures. They grasp the goods of this low life and say: 'It will be forgiven us.' If the offer of the like came to them again, they would accept it and sin again. Was not the covenant of the Scripture taken on their behalf that they should not speak anything concerning God save the truth? They have studied what is therein. The abode of the Hereafter is better for those who ward off evil. Have you then no sense?

As for those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer, never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.

When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them, We said: 'Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring to remembrance what is therein; perchance you may fear God.'

When your Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam their descendants and made them testify concerning themselves, saying: 'Am I not your Lord?' They said: 'Yes! We testify!' This, lest you should say on the Day of Judgment: 'Of this we were never mindful.'

Or lest you should say: 'Our fathers before us may have taken false gods, but we are their descendants after them: will You then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were futile?'

Thus do We explain the signs in detail; perchance they may turn unto Us.

Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray. If it had been Our will, We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he inclined to the earth and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue, or if you leave him alone, he still lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs; so relate the story; perchance they may reflect.

Evil as an example are people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls. Whom God guides, he is on the right path; whom He rejects from His guidance, such are the persons who perish.

Many are the jinns and men We have made for Hell: they have hearts wherewith they understand not, eyes wherewith they see not, and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle, nay more misguided, for they are heedless of warning.

The most beautiful names belong to God: so call on Him by them; but shun such men as use profanity in His names: for what they do, they will soon be requited.

Of those We have created are people who direct others with truth and dispense justice therewith. Those who reject Our signs, We shall gradually visit with punishment, in ways they perceive not. Respite will I grant unto them, for My scheme is strong and unfailing.

Do they not reflect? Their companion is not seized with madness; he is but a perspicuous warner. Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth and all that God has created? Do they not see that their term is nigh drawing to an end? In what message after this will they then believe?

To such as God rejects from His guidance, there can be no guide: He will leave them in their trespasses, wandering in distraction.

They ask you about the final Hour - when will be its appointed time? Say: 'The knowledge thereof is with my Lord alone: none but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only, all of a sudden will it come to you.' They ask you as if you were eager in search thereof: say: 'The knowledge thereof is with God alone, but most men know not.'"O ye who believe! Betray not God and His messenger, nor knowingly betray your trusts. And know that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial; and that it is God with Whom lies your highest reward. O ye who believe! If ye fear God, He will grant you a criterion to judge between right and wrong, remove from you all evil, and forgive you: for God is the Lord of grace unbounded. Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or slay thee, or get thee out of thy home. They plot and plan, and God too plans; but the best of planners is God. When Our Signs are rehearsed to them, they say: "We have heard this before: if we wished, we could say words like these: these are nothing but tales of the ancients." Remember how they said: "O God if this is indeed the Truth from Thee, rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky, or send us a grievous penalty." But God was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them; nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon. But what plea have they that God should not punish them, when they keep out men from the sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians? No men can be its guardians except the righteous; but most of them do not understand. Their prayer at the House of God is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: "Taste ye the penalty because ye blasphemed." The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder men from the path of God, and so will they continue to spend; but in the end, they will have only regrets and sighs; at length, they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell. In order that God may separate the impure from the pure, put the impure one on another, heap them together, and cast them into Hell. They will be the ones to have lost. Say to the Unbelievers, if they desist from Unbelief, their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already a matter of warning for them. And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, verily God doth see all that they do. If they refuse, be sure that God is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help. And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire in war, a fifth share is assigned to God, and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer, if ye do believe in God and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing, the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For God hath power over all things. Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley, and they on the farther side, and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet, ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But thus ye met, that God might accomplish a matter already enacted; that those who died might die after a clear Sign had been given, and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign had been given. And verily God is He Who heareth and knoweth all things. Remember in thy dream God showed them to thee as few: if He had shown them to thee as many, ye would surely have been discouraged, and ye would surely have disputed in your decision; but God saved you: for He knoweth well the secrets of all hearts. And remember when ye met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes, and He made you appear as contemptible in their eyes: that God might accomplish a matter already enacted. For to God do all questions go back for decision.When you met, as few in your eyes and He made you to appear little in their eyes, in order that God might bring about a matter which was to be done, and to God are all affairs returned. 

O ye who believe! When ye meet a force, be firm, and call God in remembrance much (and often); that ye may prosper. And obey God and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes, lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For God is with those who patiently persevere. And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seen of men, and to hinder (men) from the path of God: For God compasseth round about all that they do. 

Remember Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them, and said: "No one among men can overcome you this day, while I am near to you": But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, and said: "Lo! I am clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear God: for God is strict in punishment." 

Lo! the hypocrites say, and those in whose hearts is a disease: "These people,- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in God, behold! God is Exalted in might, Wise. If thou couldst see, when the angels take the souls of the Unbelievers (at death), (How) they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the penalty of the blazing Fire-" Because of (the deeds) which your (own) hands sent forth; for God is never unjust to His servants. 

(Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them: They rejected the Signs of God, and God punished them for their crimes: for God is Strong, and Strict in punishment. Because God will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily God is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things). 

For the worst of beasts in the sight of God are those who reject Him: They will not believe. They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant, but they break their covenant every time, and they have not the fear (of God). If ye gain the mastery over them in war, disperse, with them, those who follow them, that they may remember. If thou fearest treachery from any group, throw back (their covenant) to them, (so as to be) on equal terms: for God loveth not the treacherous. 

Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better (of the godly): they will never frustrate (them). Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of God and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom God doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of God, shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly. 

But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in God: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things). Should they intend to deceive thee,- verily God sufficeth thee: He it is That hath strengthened thee with His aid and with (the company of) the Believers. And (moreover) He hath put affection between their hearts: not if thou hadst spent all that is in the earth, couldst thou have produced that affection, but God hath done it: for He is Exalted in might, Wise. 

O Prophet! sufficient unto thee is God,- (unto thee) and unto those who follow thee among the Believers. O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.It will not come on you but of a sudden. They ask you as if you were solicitous about it. Say: Its knowledge is only with God, but most people do not know. Say: "I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as God wills. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I should have multiplied all good, and no evil should have touched me: I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith." Say: For myself I have no power to benefit, nor power to hurt, save that which God wills. Had I knowledge of the Unseen, I should have abundance of wealth, and adversity would not touch me. I am but a warner, and a bearer of good tidings unto folk who believe. Say: I do not control any benefit or harm for my own soul except as God pleases; and had I known the unseen I would have had much of good and no evil would have touched me; I am nothing but a warner and the giver of good news to a people who believe. It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy, they both pray to God their Lord, (saying): "If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall (ever) be grateful." He it is Who did create you from a single soul, and therefrom did make his mate that he might take rest in her. And when he covered her she bore a light burden, and she passed (unnoticed) with it, but when it became heavy they cried unto God, their Lord, saying: If thou givest unto us aright we shall be of the thankful. He it is Who created you from a single being, and of the same (kind) did He make his mate, that he might incline to her; so when he covers her she bears a light burden, then moves about with it; but when it grows heavy, they both call upon God, their Lord: If Thou givest us a good one, we shall certainly be of the grateful ones. But when He gives them a goodly child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received: but God is Exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him. But when He gave unto them aright, they ascribed unto Him partners in respect of that which He had given them. High is He Exalted above all that they associate (with Him). But when He gives them a good one, they set up with Him associates in what He has given them; but high is God above what they associate (with Him). Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created? Attribute they as partners to God those who created naught, but are themselves created, What! they associate (with Him) that which does not create any thing, while they are themselves created! No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves! And cannot give them help, nor can they help themselves? And they have no power to give them help, nor can they help themselves. If ye call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace! And if ye call them to the Guidance, they follow you not. Whether ye call them or are silent is all one for you. And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you; it is the same to you whether you invite them or you are silent. Verily those whom ye call upon besides God are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if ye are (indeed) truthful! Lo! those on whom ye call beside God are slaves like unto you. Call on them now, and let them answer you, if ye are truthful! Surely those whom you call on besides God are in a state of subjugation like yourselves; therefore call on them, then let them answer you if you are truthful. Have they feet to walk with? Or hands to lay hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say: "Call your 'god-partners', scheme (your worst) against me, and give me no respite!" Have they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they hold, or have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they hear? Say: Call upon your (so-called) partners (of God), and then contrive against me, spare me not! Have they feet with which they walk, or have they hands with which they hold, or have they eyes with which they see, or have they ears with which they hear? Say: Call your associates, then make a struggle (to prevail) against me and give me no respite. "For my Protector is God, Who revealed the Book (from time to time), and He will choose and befriend the righteous." Lo! my Protecting Friend is God Who revealeth the Scripture. He befriendeth the righteous. Surely my guardian is God, Who revealed the Book, and He befriends the good. "But those ye call upon besides Him, are unable to help you, and indeed to help themselves." They on whom ye call beside Him have no power to help you, nor can they help you, nor can they help themselves. And those whom you call upon besides Him are not able to help you, nor can they help themselves. If thou callest them to guidance, they hear not. Thou wilt see them looking at thee, but they see not. And if ye (Muslims) call them to the guidance they hear not; and thou (Muhammad) seest them looking toward thee, but they see not. And if you invite them to guidance, they do not hear; and you see them looking towards you, yet they do not see. Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant. Keep to forgiveness (O Muhammad), and enjoin kindness, and turn away from the ignorant. Take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn aside from the ignorant. If a suggestion from Satan assail thy (mind), seek refuge with God; for He heareth and knoweth (all things). And if a slander from the devil wound thee, then seek refuge in God. Lo! He is Hearer, Knower. And if a false imputation from the Shaitan afflict you, seek refuge in God; surely He is Hearing, Knowing. Those who fear God, when a thought of evil from Satan assaults them, bring God to remembrance, when lo! they see (aright)! Lo! those who ward off (evil), when a glamour from the devil troubleth them, they do but remember (God's Guidance) and behold them seers! Surely those who guard (against evil), when a visitation from the Shaitan afflicts them they become mindful, then lo! they see. But their brethren (the evil ones) plunge them deeper into error, and never relax (their efforts). Their brethren plunge them further into error and cease not. And their brethren increase them in error, then they cease not. If thou bring them not a revelation, they say: "Why hast thou not got it together?" Say: "I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord: this is (nothing but) lights from your Lord, and Guidance, and mercy, for any who have faith." And when thou bringest not a verse for them they say: Why hast thou not chosen it? Say: I follow only that which is inspired in me from my Lord. This (Qur'an) is insight from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for a people that believe. And when you bring them not a revelation they say: Why do you not forge it? Say: I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord; these are clear proofs from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe. When the Qur'an is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace: that ye may receive Mercy. And when the Qur'an is recited, give ear to it and pay heed, that ye may obtain mercy. And when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and remain silent, that mercy may be shown to you. And do thou (O reader!) Bring thy Lord to remembrance in thy (very) soul, with humility and in reverence, without loudness in words, in the mornings and evenings; and be not thou of those who are unheedful. And do thou (O Muhammad) remember thy Lord within thyself humbly and with awe, below thy breath, at morn and evening. And be not thou of the neglectful. And remember your Lord within yourself humbly and fearing and in a voice not loud in the morning and the evening and be not of the heedless ones. Those who are near to thy Lord, disdain not to do Him worship: They celebrate His praises, and prostrate before Him. Lo! those who are with thy Lord are not too proud to do Him service, but they praise Him and prostrate before Him. Surely those who are with your Lord are not too proud to serve Him, and they declare His glory and prostrate in humility before Him.The believers to war; if there are twenty patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a hundred of you they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand. For the present, God hath lightened your task, for He knoweth that there is a weak spot in you: But even so, if there are a hundred of you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred, and if a thousand, they will vanquish two thousand, with the leave of God: for God is with those who patiently persevere. Now hath God lightened your burden, for He knoweth that there is weakness in you. So if there be of you a steadfast hundred they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a thousand they shall overcome two thousand by permission of God. God is with the steadfast. For the present God has made light your burden, and He knows that there is weakness in you; so if there are a hundred patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a thousand they shall overcome two thousand by God's permission, and God is with the patient. It is not fitting for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but God looketh to the Hereafter: And God is Exalted in might, Wise. It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land. Ye desire the lure of this world and God desireth for you the Hereafter, and God is Mighty, Wise. It is not fit for a prophet that he should take captives unless he has fought and triumphed in the land; you desire the frail goods of this world, while God desires for you the hereafter; and God is Mighty, Wise. Had it not been for a previous ordainment from God, a severe penalty would have reached you for the ransom that ye took. Had it not been for an ordinance of God which had gone before, an awful doom had come upon you on account of what ye took. Were it not for an ordinance from God that had already gone forth, surely there would have befallen you a great chastisement for what you had taken to. But now enjoy what ye took in war, lawful and good: but fear God: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Now enjoy what ye have won, as lawful and good, and keep your duty to God. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. Eat then of the lawful and good things which you have acquired in war, and be careful of your duty to God; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. O Prophet! say to those who are captives in your hands: "If God findeth any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." O Prophet! Say unto those captives who are in your hands: If God knoweth any good in your hearts He will give you better than that which hath been taken from you, and will forgive you. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. O Prophet! say to those of the captives who are in your hands: If God knows anything good in your hearts, He will give to you better than that which has been taken away from you and will forgive you, and God is Forgiving, Merciful. But if they have treacherous designs against thee, they have already been in treason against God, and so hath He given thee power over them. And God so He Who hath full knowledge and wisdom. And if they would betray thee, they betrayed God before, and He gave thee power over them. God is Knower, Wise. And if they intend to act unfaithfully towards you, so indeed they acted unfaithfully towards God before, but He gave you mastery over them; and God is Knowing, Wise. Those who believed, and adopted exile, and fought for the Faith, with their property and their persons, in the cause of God, as well as those who gave them asylum and aid, these are all friends and protectors, one of another. As to those who believed but came not into exile, ye owe no duty of protection to them until they come into exile; but if they seek your aid in religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a people with whom ye have a treaty of mutual alliance. And remember God seeth all that ye do. Lo! those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of God, and those who took them in and helped them: these are protecting friends one of another. And those who believed but did not leave their homes, ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes; but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to help them except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty. God is Seer of what ye do. Surely those who believed and fled their homes and struggled hard in God's way with their property and their souls, and those who gave shelter and helped these are guardians of each other; and as for those who believed and did not fly, not yours is their guardianship until they fly; and if they seek aid from you in the matter of religion, aid is incumbent on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty, and God sees what you do. The Unbelievers are protectors, one of another: Unless ye do this, protect each other, there would be tumult and oppression on earth, and great mischief. And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another - If ye do not so, there will be confusion in the land, and great corruption. And as for those who disbelieve, some of them are the guardians of others; if you will not do it, there will be in the land persecution and great mischief. Those who believe, and adopt exile, and fight for the Faith, in the cause of God as well as those who give them asylum and aid, these are all in very truth the Believers: for them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision most generous. Those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of God, and those who took them in and helped them - these are the believers in truth. For them is pardon, and bountiful provision. And as for those who believed and fled and struggled hard in God's way, and those who gave shelter and helped, these are the believers truly; they shall have forgiveness and honorable provision. And those who accept Faith subsequently, and adopt exile, and fight for the Faith in your company, they are of you. But kindred by blood have prior rights against each other in the Book of God. Verily God is well-acquainted with all things. And those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along with you, they are of you; and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the ordinance of God. Lo! God is Knower of all things. And as for those who believed afterwards and fled and struggled hard along with you, they are of you; and the possessors of relationships are nearer to each other in the ordinance of God; surely God knows all things."Even as your Lord caused you to go forth from your house with the truth, though a party of the believers were surely averse; 008.006 Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest, as if they were being driven to death and they (actually) saw it. 008.007 Behold! God promised you one of the two (enemy) parties, that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but God willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers; 008.008 That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false, distasteful though it be to those in guilt. 008.009 Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord, and He answered you: 'I will assist you with a thousand of the angels, ranks on ranks.' 008.010 God made it but a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from God: and God is Exalted in Power, Wise. 008.011 Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness, to give you calm as from Himself, and He caused rain to descend on you from heaven, to clean you therewith, to remove from you the stain of Satan, to strengthen your hearts, and to plant your feet firmly therewith. 008.012 Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): 'I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them.' 008.013 This because they contended against God and His Messenger: If any contend against God and His Messenger, God is strict in punishment. 008.014 Thus (will it be said): 'Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who resist God, is the penalty of the Fire.' 008.015 O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them. 008.016 If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop (of his own) - he draws on himself the wrath of God, and his abode is Hell, an evil refuge (indeed)! 008.017 It is not ye who slew them; it was God: when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but God's: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for God is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things). 008.018 That, and also because God is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers. 008.019 (O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed for victory and judgment, now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist (from wrong), it will be best for you: if ye return (to the attack), so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied: for verily God is with those who believe! 008.020 O ye who believe! Obey God and His Messenger, and turn not away from him when ye hear (him speak). 008.021 Nor be like those who say, 'We hear,' but listen not: 008.022 For the worst of beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb, those who understand not. 008.023 If God had found in them any good, He would indeed have made them listen: (As it is), if He had made them listen, they would but have turned back and declined (Faith). 008.024 O ye who believe! give your response to God and His Messenger, when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that God cometh in between a man and his heart, and that it is He to Whom ye shall (all) be gathered. 008.025 And fear tumult or oppression, which affecteth not in particular (only) those of you who do wrong: and know that God is strict in punishment. 008.026 Call to mind when ye were a small (band), despised through the land, and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; But He provided a safe asylum for you, strengthened you with His aid, and gave you Good things for sustenance: that ye might be grateful. 008.027 O ye that believe! betray not the trust of God and the Messenger, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you.""O ye who believe! Betray not God and His messenger, nor knowingly betray your trusts. And know that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial; and that it is God with Whom lies your highest reward. O ye who believe! if ye fear God, He will grant you a criterion (to judge between right and wrong), remove from you (all) evil (that may afflict) you, and forgive you: for God is the Lord of grace unbounded. Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or slay thee, or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan, and God too plans; but the best of planners is God. When Our Signs are rehearsed to them, they say: 'We have heard this (before): if we wished, we could say (words) like these: these are nothing but tales of the ancients.' Remember how they said: 'O God if this is indeed the Truth from Thee, rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky, or send us a grievous penalty.' But God was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them; nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon. But what plea have they that God should not punish them, when they keep out (men) from the sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians? No men can be its guardians except the righteous; but most of them do not understand. Their prayer at the House (of God) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: (Its only answer can be), 'Taste ye the penalty because ye blasphemed.' The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder (man) from the path of God, and so will they continue to spend; but in the end they will have (only) regrets and sighs; at length they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell. In order that God may separate the impure from the pure, put the impure, one on another, heap them together, and cast them into Hell. They will be the ones to have lost. Say to the Unbelievers, if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them). And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, verily God doth see all that they do. If they refuse, be sure that God is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help. And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to God, and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer, if ye do believe in God and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing, the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For God hath power over all things. Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley, and they on the farther side, and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet, ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But (thus ye met), that God might accomplish a matter already enacted; that those who died might die after a clear Sign (had been given), and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign (had been given). And verily God is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things). Remember in thy dream God showed them to thee as few: if He had shown them to thee as many, ye would surely have been discouraged, and ye would surely have disputed in (your) decision; but God saved (you): for He knoweth well the (secrets) of (all) hearts. And remember when ye met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes, and He made you appear as contemptible in their eyes: that God might accomplish a matter already enacted. For to God do all questions go back (for decision)."When you met, as few in your eyes and He made you to appear little in their eyes, in order that God might bring about a matter which was to be done, and to God are all affairs returned. O ye who believe! When ye meet a force, be firm, and call God in remembrance much (and often); that ye may prosper. And obey God and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes, lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For God is with those who patiently persevere. And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seen of men, and to hinder (men) from the path of God: For God compasseth round about all that they do. Remember Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them, and said: "No one among men can overcome you this day, while I am near to you": But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, and said: "Lo! I am clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear God: for God is strict in punishment." Lo! the hypocrites say, and those in whose hearts is a disease: "These people,- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in God, behold! God is Exalted in might, Wise. If thou couldst see, when the angels take the souls of the Unbelievers (at death), (How) they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the penalty of the blazing Fire-" Because of (the deeds) which your (own) hands sent forth; for God is never unjust to His servants. (Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them: They rejected the Signs of God, and God punished them for their crimes: for God is Strong, and Strict in punishment. Because God will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily God is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things). (Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them: They treated as false the Signs of their Lord: so We destroyed them for their crimes, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh: for they were all oppressors and wrong-doers. For the worst of beasts in the sight of God are those who reject Him: They will not believe. They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant, but they break their covenant every time, and they have not the fear (of God). If ye gain the mastery over them in war, disperse, with them, those who follow them, that they may remember. If thou fearest treachery from any group, throw back (their covenant) to them, (so as to be) on equal terms: for God loveth not the treacherous. Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better (of the godly): they will never frustrate (them). Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of God and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom God doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of God, shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly. But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in God: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things). Should they intend to deceive thee,- verily God sufficeth thee: He it is That hath strengthened thee with His aid and with (the company of) the Believers. And (moreover) He hath put affection between their hearts: not if thou hadst spent all that is in the earth, couldst thou have produced that affection, but God hath done it: for He is Exalted in might, Wise. O Prophet! sufficient unto thee is God,- (unto thee) and unto those who follow thee among the Believers. O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people without understanding."9.006 Y: If one amongst the Pagans asks thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of God; and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge. P: And if anyone of the idolaters seeks thy protection (O Muhammad), then protect him so that he may hear the Word of God, and afterward convey him to his place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not. S: And if one of the idolaters seeks protection from you, grant him protection till he hears the word of God, then make him attain his place of safety; this is because they are a people who do not know.

009.007 Y: How can there be a league, before God and His Messenger, with the Pagans, except those with whom ye made a treaty near the sacred Mosque? As long as these stand true to you, stand ye true to them: for God doth love the righteous. P: How can there be a treaty with God and with His messenger for the idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship? So long as they are true to you, be true to them. Lo! God loveth those who keep their duty. S: How can there be an agreement for the idolaters with God and with His Messenger; except those with whom you made an agreement at the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they are true to you, be true to them; surely God loves those who are careful (of their duty).

009.008 Y: How (can there be such a league), seeing that if they get an advantage over you, they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant? With (fair words from) their mouths they entice you, but their hearts are averse from you; and most of them are rebellious and wicked. P: How (can there be any treaty for the others) when, if they have the upper hand of you, they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you? They satisfy you with their mouths the while their hearts refuse. And most of them are wrongdoers. S: How (can it be)! while if they prevail against you, they would not pay regard in your case to ties of relationship, nor those of covenant; they please you with their mouths while their hearts do not consent; and most of them are transgressors.

009.009 Y: The Signs of God have they sold for a miserable price, and (many) have they hindered from His way: evil indeed are the deeds they have done. P: They have purchased with the revelations of God a little gain, so they debar (men) from His way. Lo! evil is that which they are wont to do. S: They have taken a small price for the communications of God, so they turn away from His way; surely evil is it that they do.

009.010 Y: In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who have transgressed all bounds. P: And they observe toward a believer neither pact nor honour. These are they who are transgressors. S: They do not pay regard to ties of relationship nor those of covenant in the case of a believer; and these are they who go beyond the limits.

009.011 Y: But (even so), if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity,- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail, for those who understand. P: But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge. S: But if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, they are your brethren in faith; and We make the communications clear for a people who know.

009.012 Y: But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and taunt you for your Faith,- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them: that thus they may be restrained. P: And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist. S: And if they break their oaths after their agreement and (openly) revile your religion, then fight the leaders of unbelief surely their oaths are nothing so that they may desist.

009.013 Y: Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger, and took the aggressive by being the first (to assault) you? Do ye fear them? Nay, it is God Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye believe! P: Will ye not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges, and purposed to drive out the messenger and did attack you first? What! Fear ye them? Now God hath more right that ye should fear Him, if ye are believers. S: What! will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the Messenger, and they attacked you first; do you fear them? But God is most deserving that you should fear Him, if you are believers.

009.014 Y: Fight them, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you (to victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers, P: Fight them! God will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers. S: Fight them, God will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace, and assist you against them and heal the hearts of a believing people.

009.015 Y: And still the indignation of their hearts. For God will turn (in mercy) to whom He will; and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. P: And He will remove the anger of their hearts. God relenteth toward whom He will. God is Knower, Wise. S: And remove the rage of their hearts; and God turns (mercifully) to whom He pleases, and God is Knowing, Wise.

009.016 Y: Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned, as though God did not know those among you who strive with might and main, and take none for friends and protectors except God, His Messenger, and the (community of) Believers? But God is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do. P: Or deemed ye that ye would be left (in peace) when God yet knoweth not those of you who strive, choosing for familiar none save God and His messenger and the believers? God is Informed of what ye do. S: What! do you think that you will be left alone while God has not yet known those of you who have struggled hard and have not taken any one as an adherent besides God and His Messenger and the believers; and God is aware of what you do.

009.017 Y: It is not for such as join gods with God, to visit or maintain the mosques of God while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell. P: It is not for the idolaters to tend God's sanctuaries, bearing witness against themselves of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain and in the Fire they will abide. S: The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of God while bearing witness to unbelief against themselves, these it is whose doings are null, and in the fire shall they abide.

009.018 Y: The mosques of God shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in God and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity, and fear none (at all) except God. It is they who are expected to be on true guidance. P: He only shall tend God's sanctuaries who believeth in God and the Last Day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due and feareth none save God. For such (only) is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided. S: Only he shall visit the mosques of God who believes in God and the latter day, and keeps up prayer and pays the poor-rate and fears none but God; so (as for) these, it may be that they are of the followers of the right course.

009.019 Y: Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque, equal to (the pious service of) those who believe in God and the Last Day, and strive with might and main in the cause of God? They are not comparable in the sight of God: and God guides not those who do wrong. P: Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst and tendance of the Inviolable Place of Worship as (equal to the worth of) him who believeth in God and the Last Day, and striveth in the way of God? They are not equal in the sight of God. God guideth not wrongdoing folk. S: What! do you make (one who undertakes) the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque like him who believes in God and the latter day and strives hard in God's way? They are not equal with God; and God does not guide the unjust people.

009.020 Y: Those who believe, and suffer exile and strive with might and main, in God's cause, with their goods and their persons, have the highest rank in the sight of God: they are the people who will achieve (salvation). P: Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in God's way are of much greater worth in God's sight. These are they who are triumphant. S: Those who believed and fled (their homes), and strove hard in God's way with their property and their souls, are much higher in rank with God; and those are they who are the achievers (of their objects).

009.021 Y: Their Lord doth give them glad tidings of a Mercy from Himself, of His good pleasure, and of gardens for them, wherein are delights that endure: P: Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs; S: Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself and (His) good pleasure and gardens, wherein lasting blessings shall be theirs;

009.022 Y: They will dwell therein for ever. Verily in God's presence is a reward, the greatest (of all). P: There they will abide for ever. Lo! with God there is immense reward. S: Abiding therein for ever; surely God has a Mighty reward with Him.

009.023 Y: O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so, they do wrong. P: O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends, such are wrong-doers. S: O you who believe! do not take your fathers and your brothers for guardians if they love unbelief more than belief; and whoever of you takes them for a guardian, these it is that are the unjust.

009.024 Y: Say: If it be that your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, or your kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than God, or His Messenger, or the striving in His cause;- then wait until God brings about His decision: and God guides not the rebellious. P: Say: If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your tribe, and the wealth ye have acquired, and merchandise for which ye fear that there will no sale, and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than God and His messenger and striving in His way: then waitThe believers to war; if there are twenty patient ones of you, they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a hundred of you, they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand. For the present, God hath lightened your task, for He knoweth that there is a weak spot in you: But even so, if there are a hundred of you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred, and if a thousand, they will vanquish two thousand, with the leave of God: for God is with those who patiently persevere. Now hath God lightened your burden, for He knoweth that there is weakness in you. So if there be of you a steadfast hundred, they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a thousand, they shall overcome two thousand by permission of God. God is with the steadfast. For the present, God has made light your burden, and He knows that there is weakness in you; so if there are a hundred patient ones of you, they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a thousand, they shall overcome two thousand by God's permission, and God is with the patient. It is not fitting for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but God looketh to the Hereafter: And God is Exalted in might, Wise. It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land. Ye desire the lure of this world, and God desireth for you the Hereafter, and God is Mighty, Wise. It is not fit for a prophet that he should take captives unless he has fought and triumphed in the land; you desire the frail goods of this world, while God desires for you the hereafter; and God is Mighty, Wise. Had it not been for a previous ordainment from God, a severe penalty would have reached you for the ransom that ye took. Had it not been for an ordinance of God which had gone before, an awful doom had come upon you on account of what ye took. Were it not for an ordinance from God that had already gone forth, surely there would have befallen you a great chastisement for what you had taken. But now enjoy what ye took in war, lawful and good: but fear God: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Now enjoy what ye have won, as lawful and good, and keep your duty to God. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. Eat then of the lawful and good things which you have acquired in war, and be careful of your duty to God; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. O Prophet! say to those who are captives in your hands: "If God findeth any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." O Prophet! Say unto those captives who are in your hands: If God knoweth any good in your hearts, He will give you better than that which hath been taken from you, and will forgive you. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. O Prophet! say to those of the captives who are in your hands: If God knows anything good in your hearts, He will give to you better than that which has been taken away from you and will forgive you, and God is Forgiving, Merciful. But if they have treacherous designs against thee, they have already been in treason against God, and so hath He given thee power over them. And God is He Who hath full knowledge and wisdom. And if they would betray thee, they betrayed God before, and He gave thee power over them. God is Knower, Wise. And if they intend to act unfaithfully towards you, so indeed they acted unfaithfully towards God before, but He gave you mastery over them; and God is Knowing, Wise. Those who believed, and adopted exile, and fought for the Faith, with their property and their persons, in the cause of God, as well as those who gave them asylum and aid, these are all friends and protectors, one of another. As to those who believed but came not into exile, ye owe no duty of protection to them until they come into exile; but if they seek your aid in religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a people with whom ye have a treaty of mutual alliance. And remember God seeth all that ye do. Lo! those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of God, and those who took them in and helped them: these are protecting friends one of another. And those who believed but did not leave their homes, ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes; but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion, then it is your duty to help them except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty. God is Seer of what ye do. Surely those who believed and fled their homes and struggled hard in God's way with their property and their souls, and those who gave shelter and helped, these are guardians of each other; and as for those who believed and did not fly, not yours is their guardianship until they fly; and if they seek aid from you in the matter of religion, aid is incumbent on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty, and God sees what you do. The Unbelievers are protectors, one of another: Unless ye do this, protect each other, there would be tumult and oppression on earth, and great mischief. And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another - If ye do not so, there will be confusion in the land, and great corruption. And as for those who disbelieve, some of them are the guardians of others; if you will not do it, there will be in the land persecution and great mischief. Those who believe, and adopt exile, and fight for the Faith, in the cause of God as well as those who give them asylum and aid, these are all in very truth the Believers: for them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision most generous. Those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of God, and those who took them in and helped them - these are the believers in truth. For them is pardon, and bountiful provision. And as for those who believed and fled and struggled hard in God's way, and those who gave shelter and helped, these are the believers truly; they shall have forgiveness and honorable provision. And those who accept Faith subsequently, and adopt exile, and fight for the Faith in your company, they are of you. But kindred by blood have prior rights against each other in the Book of God. Verily God is well-acquainted with all things. And those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along with you, they are of you; and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the ordinance of God. Lo! God is Knower of all things. And as for those who believed afterwards and fled and struggled hard along with you, they are of you; and the possessors of relationships are nearer to each other in the ordinance of God; surely God knows all things.till God bringeth His command to pass. God guideth not wrongdoing folk. Say: If your fathers, sons, brethren, mates, kinsfolk, property which you have acquired, and the slackness of trade which you fear, and dwellings which you like, are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and striving in His way, then wait till God brings about His command: and God does not guide the transgressing people.

Assuredly God did help you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land, for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat. God hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of Huneyn, when ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught, and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you; then ye turned back in flight. Certainly God helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you vain, but they availed you nothing and the earth became strait to you notwithstanding its spaciousness, then you turned back retreating.

But God did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers, and sent down forces which ye saw not: He punished the Unbelievers; thus doth He reward those without Faith. Then God sent His peace of reassurance down upon His messenger and upon the believers, and sent down hosts ye could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such is the reward of disbelievers. Then God sent down His tranquillity upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and sent down hosts which you did not see, and chastised those who disbelieved, and that is the reward of the unbelievers.

Again will God, after this, turn (in mercy) to whom He will; for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Then afterward God will relent toward whom He will; for God is Forgiving, Merciful. Then will God after this turn (mercifully) to whom He pleases, and God is Forgiving, Merciful.

O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will God enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean. So let them not come near the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year. If ye fear poverty (from the loss of their merchandise) God shall preserve you of His bounty if He will. Lo! God is Knower, Wise. O you who believe! the idolaters are nothing but unclean, so they shall not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year; and if you fear poverty then God will enrich you out of His grace if He please; surely God is Knowing Wise.

Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in God nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which God hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low. Fight those who do not believe in God, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what God and His Messenger have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.

The Jews call 'Uzair a son of God, and the Christians call Christ the son of God. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. God's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth! And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of God, and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of God. That is their saying with their mouths. They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved of old. God (Himself) fighteth against them. How perverse are they! And the Jews say: Uzair is the son of God; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of God; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may God destroy them; how they are turned away!

They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of God, and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One God: there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him). They have taken as lords beside God their rabbis and their monks and the Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One God. There is no God save Him. Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! They have taken their doctors of law and their monks for lords besides God, and (also) the Messiah son of Marium and they were enjoined that they should serve one God only, there is no god but He; far from His glory be what they set up (with Him).

Fain would they extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God will not allow but that His light should be perfected, even though the Unbelievers may detest (it). Fain would they put out the light of God with their mouths, but God disdaineth (aught) save that He shall perfect His light, however much the disbelievers are averse. They desire to put out the light of God with their mouths, and God will not consent save to perfect His light, though the unbelievers are averse.

It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion, even though the Pagans may detest (it). He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the idolaters may be averse. He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, that He might cause it to prevail over all religions, though the polytheists may be averse.

O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites, who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder (them) from the way of God. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God: announce unto them a most grievous penalty. O ye who believe! Lo! many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar (men) from the way of God. They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God, unto them give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom. O you who believe! most surely many of the doctors of law and the monks eat away the property of men falsely, and turn (them) from God's way; and (as for) those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in God's way, announce to them a painful chastisement.

On the Day when heat will be produced out of that (wealth) in the fire of Hell, and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs. "This is the (treasure) which ye buried for yourselves: taste ye, then, the (treasures) ye buried!" On the day when it will (all) be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith (and it will be said unto them): Here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what ye used to hoard. On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, then their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it; this is what you hoarded up for yourselves, therefore taste what you hoarded.

The number of months in the sight of God is twelve (in a year)- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred: that is the straight usage. So wrong not yourselves therein, and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that God is with those who restrain themselves. Lo! the number of the months with God is twelve months by God's ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are sacred: that is the right religion. So wrong not yourselves in them. And wage war on all of the idolaters as they are waging war on all of you. And know that God is with those who keep their duty (unto Him). Surely the number of months with God is twelve months in God's ordinance since the day when He created the heavens and the earth, of these four being sacred; that is the right reckoning; therefore be not unjust to yourselves regarding them, and fight the polytheists all together as they fight you all together; and know that God is with those who guard (against evil).

Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief: the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year, and forbidden another year, in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by God and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But God guideth not those who reject Faith. Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an excess of disbelief whereby those who disbelieve are misled; they allow it one year and forbid it (another) year, that they may make up the number of the months which God hath hallowed, so that they allow that which God hath forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made fairseeming unto them. God guideth not the disbelieving folk. Postponing (of the sacred month) is only an addition in unbelief, wherewith those who disbelieve are led astray, violating it one year and keeping it sacred another, that they may agree in the number (of months) that God has made sacred, and thus violate what God has made sacred; the evil of their doings is made fairseeming to them; and God does not guide the unbelieving people.

O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of God, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. O ye who believe! What aileth you that when it is said unto you: Go forth in the way of God, ye are bowed down to the ground with heaviness. Take ye pleasure in the life of the world rather than in the Hereafter? The comfort of the life of the world is but little in the Hereafter. O you who believe! What (excuse) have you that when it is said to you: Go forth in God's way, you should incline heavily to earth; are you contented with this world's life instead of the hereafter? But the provision of this world's life compared with the hereafter is but little.Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For God hath power over all things. If ye go not forth, He will afflict you with a painful doom, and will choose instead of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot harm Him at all. God is Able to do all things.

If ye help not (your leader), (it is no matter): for God did indeed help him, when the Unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion; they two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, "Have no fear, for God is with us": then God sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of God is exalted to the heights: for God is Exalted in Might, Wise.

Go ye forth, (whether equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle, with your goods and your persons, in the cause of God. That is best for you, if ye (but) knew.

If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them. They would indeed swear by God, "If we only could, we should certainly have come out with you": They would destroy their own souls; for God doth know that they are certainly lying.

God give thee grace! why didst thou grant them exemption until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light, and thou hadst proved the liars?

Those who believe in God and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons. And God knoweth well those who do their duty.

Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in God and the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro.

If they had intended to come out, they would certainly have made some preparation therefor; but God was averse to their being sent forth; so He made them lag behind, and they were told, "Sit ye among those who sit (inactive)."

If they had come out with you, they would not have added to your (strength) but only (made for) disorder, hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you, and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. But God knoweth well those who do wrong.

Indeed they had plotted sedition before, and upset matters for thee, until the Truth arrived, and the Decree of God became manifest much to their disgust.

Among them is (many) a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already? and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides).

If good befalls thee, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee, they say, "We took indeed our precautions beforehand," and they turn away rejoicing.

Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what God has decreed for us: He is our protector": and on God let the Believers put their trust.

Say: "Can you expect for us (any fate) other than one of two glorious things- (Martyrdom or victory)? But we can expect for you either that God will send his punishment from Himself, or by our hands. So wait (expectant); we too will wait with you."

Say: "Spend (for the cause) willingly or unwillingly: not from you will it be accepted: for ye are indeed a people rebellious and wicked."

The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are: that they reject God and His Messenger; that they come to prayer without earnestness; and that they offer contributions unwillingly.

Let not their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: in reality God's plan is to punish them with these things in this life, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of God.

They swear by God that they are indeed of you; but they are not of you: yet they are afraid (to appear in their true colours)."9.006 Y: If one amongst the Pagans asks thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of God; and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge. P: And if anyone of the idolaters seeks thy protection (O Muhammad), then protect him so that he may hear the Word of God, and afterward convey him to his place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not. S: And if one of the idolaters seeks protection from you, grant him protection till he hears the word of God, then make him attain his place of safety; this is because they are a people who do not know.

009.007 Y: How can there be a league, before God and His Messenger, with the Pagans, except those with whom ye made a treaty near the sacred Mosque? As long as these stand true to you, stand ye true to them: for God doth love the righteous. P: How can there be a treaty with God and with His messenger for the idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship? So long as they are true to you, be true to them. Lo! God loveth those who keep their duty. S: How can there be an agreement for the idolaters with God and with His Messenger; except those with whom you made an agreement at the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they are true to you, be true to them; surely God loves those who are careful (of their duty).

009.008 Y: How (can there be such a league), seeing that if they get an advantage over you, they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant? With (fair words from) their mouths they entice you, but their hearts are averse from you; and most of them are rebellious and wicked. P: How (can there be any treaty for the others) when, if they have the upper hand of you, they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you? They satisfy you with their mouths the while their hearts refuse. And most of them are wrongdoers. S: How (can it be)! while if they prevail against you, they would not pay regard in your case to ties of relationship, nor those of covenant; they please you with their mouths while their hearts do not consent; and most of them are transgressors.

009.009 Y: The Signs of God have they sold for a miserable price, and (many) have they hindered from His way: evil indeed are the deeds they have done. P: They have purchased with the revelations of God a little gain, so they debar (men) from His way. Lo! evil is that which they are wont to do. S: They have taken a small price for the communications of God, so they turn away from His way; surely evil is it that they do.

009.010 Y: In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who have transgressed all bounds. P: And they observe toward a believer neither pact nor honour. These are they who are transgressors. S: They do not pay regard to ties of relationship nor those of covenant in the case of a believer; and these are they who go beyond the limits.

009.011 Y: But (even so), if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity,- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail, for those who understand. P: But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge. S: But if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, they are your brethren in faith; and We make the communications clear for a people who know.

009.012 Y: But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and taunt you for your Faith,- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them: that thus they may be restrained. P: And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist. S: And if they break their oaths after their agreement and (openly) revile your religion, then fight the leaders of unbelief surely their oaths are nothing so that they may desist.

009.013 Y: Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger, and took the aggressive by being the first (to assault) you? Do ye fear them? Nay, it is God Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye believe! P: Will ye not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges, and purposed to drive out the messenger and did attack you first? What! Fear ye them? Now God hath more right that ye should fear Him, if ye are believers. S: What! will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the Messenger, and they attacked you first; do you fear them? But God is most deserving that you should fear Him, if you are believers.

009.014 Y: Fight them, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you (to victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers, P: Fight them! God will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers. S: Fight them, God will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace, and assist you against them and heal the hearts of a believing people.

009.015 Y: And still the indignation of their hearts. For God will turn (in mercy) to whom He will; and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. P: And He will remove the anger of their hearts. God relenteth toward whom He will. God is Knower, Wise. S: And remove the rage of their hearts; and God turns (mercifully) to whom He pleases, and God is Knowing, Wise.

009.016 Y: Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned, as though God did not know those among you who strive with might and main, and take none for friends and protectors except God, His Messenger, and the (community of) Believers? But God is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do. P: Or deemed ye that ye would be left (in peace) when God yet knoweth not those of you who strive, choosing for familiar none save God and His messenger and the believers? God is Informed of what ye do. S: What! do you think that you will be left alone while God has not yet known those of you who have struggled hard and have not taken any one as an adherent besides God and His Messenger and the believers; and God is aware of what you do.

009.017 Y: It is not for such as join gods with God, to visit or maintain the mosques of God while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell. P: It is not for the idolaters to tend God's sanctuaries, bearing witness against themselves of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain and in the Fire they will abide. S: The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of God while bearing witness to unbelief against themselves, these it is whose doings are null, and in the fire shall they abide.

009.018 Y: The mosques of God shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in God and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity, and fear none (at all) except God. It is they who are expected to be on true guidance. P: He only shall tend God's sanctuaries who believeth in God and the Last Day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due and feareth none save God. For such (only) is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided. S: Only he shall visit the mosques of God who believes in God and the latter day, and keeps up prayer and pays the poor-rate and fears none but God; so (as for) these, it may be that they are of the followers of the right course.

009.019 Y: Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque, equal to (the pious service of) those who believe in God and the Last Day, and strive with might and main in the cause of God? They are not comparable in the sight of God: and God guides not those who do wrong. P: Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst and tendance of the Inviolable Place of Worship as (equal to the worth of) him who believeth in God and the Last Day, and striveth in the way of God? They are not equal in the sight of God. God guideth not wrongdoing folk. S: What! do you make (one who undertakes) the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque like him who believes in God and the latter day and strives hard in God's way? They are not equal with God; and God does not guide the unjust people.

009.020 Y: Those who believe, and suffer exile and strive with might and main, in God's cause, with their goods and their persons, have the highest rank in the sight of God: they are the people who will achieve (salvation). P: Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in God's way are of much greater worth in God's sight. These are they who are triumphant. S: Those who believed and fled (their homes), and strove hard in God's way with their property and their souls, are much higher in rank with God; and those are they who are the achievers (of their objects).

009.021 Y: Their Lord doth give them glad tidings of a Mercy from Himself, of His good pleasure, and of gardens for them, wherein are delights that endure: P: Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs; S: Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself and (His) good pleasure and gardens, wherein lasting blessings shall be theirs;

009.022 Y: They will dwell therein for ever. Verily in God's presence is a reward, the greatest (of all). P: There they will abide for ever. Lo! with God there is immense reward. S: Abiding therein for ever; surely God has a Mighty reward with Him.

009.023 Y: O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so, they do wrong. P: O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends, such are wrong-doers. S: O you who believe! do not take your fathers and your brothers for guardians if they love unbelief more than belief; and whoever of you takes them for a guardian, these it is that are the unjust.

009.024 Y: Say: If it be that your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, or your kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than God, or His Messenger, or the striving in His cause;- then wait until God brings about His decision: and God guides not the rebellious. P: Say: If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your tribe, and the wealth ye have acquired, and merchandise for which ye fear that there will no sale, and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than God and His messenger and striving in His way: then wait"If they could find a place to flee to, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightaway thereto, with an obstinate rush. And among them are men who slander thee in the matter of the alms: if they are given part thereof, they are pleased, but if not, behold! they are indignant! If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger gave them, and had said, "Sufficient unto us is God! God and His Messenger will soon give us of His bounty: to God do we turn our hopes!" (that would have been the right course). Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the funds; for those whose hearts have been recently reconciled to Truth; for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of God; and for the wayfarer: thus is it ordained by God, and God is full of knowledge and wisdom. Among them are men who molest the Prophet and say, "He is all ear." Say, "He listens to what is best for you: he believes in God, has faith in the Believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." But those who molest the Messenger will have a grievous penalty. To you they swear by God in order to please you: but it is more fitting that they should please God and His Messenger, if they are Believers. Know they not that for those who oppose God and His Messenger, is the Fire of Hell?- wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace. The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them, showing them what is really passing in their hearts. Say: "Mock ye! But verily God will bring to light all that ye fear should be revealed." If thou dost question them, they declare with emphasis: "We were only talking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at God, and His Signs, and His Messenger, that ye were mocking?" Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are in sin. The Hypocrites, men and women, have an understanding with each other: they enjoin evil, and forbid what is just, and are close with their hands. They have forgotten God; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse. God hath promised the Hypocrites men and women, and the rejecters of Faith, the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them: for them is the curse of God, and an enduring punishment. As in the case of those before you: they were mightier than you in power, and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of their portion: and ye have of yours, as did those before you; and ye indulge in idle talk as they did. They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will lose all spiritual good. Hath not the story reached them of those before them?- the People of Noah, and 'Ad, and Thamud; the People of Abraham, the men of Midian, and the cities overthrown. To them came their messengers with clear signs. It is not God Who wrongs them, but they wrong their own souls. The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practice regular charity, and obey God and His Messenger. On them will God pour His mercy: for God is Exalted in Power, Wise. God hath promised to Believers, men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of God: that is the supreme felicity.O Prophet! Strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell, an evil refuge indeed. They swear by God that they said nothing evil, but indeed they uttered blasphemy after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out. If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back to their evil ways, God will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter. Amongst them are men who made a covenant with God, that if He bestowed on them of His bounty, they would give in charity and be righteous. But when He did bestow His bounty, they became covetous and turned back from their covenant. So He has put hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day they shall meet Him, because they broke their covenant with God and lied. Know they not that God knows their secret thoughts and counsels? Those who slander the believers who give freely to charity and those who can only give a little, God will throw back their ridicule on them, and they shall have a grievous penalty. Whether you ask for their forgiveness or not, God will not forgive them because they have rejected Him and His Messenger. Those who were left behind in the Tabuk expedition rejoiced in their inaction and hated to strive in the cause of God. They said, "Go not forth in the heat." Say, "The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat." Let them laugh a little and weep much as a recompense for their deeds. If God brings you back to any of them and they ask your permission to come out, say, "Never shall you come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me." Nor do you ever pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave; for they rejected God and His Messenger and died in a state of rebellion. Nor let their wealth or children dazzle you; God's plan is to punish them with these things in this world and that their souls may perish in their denial of God. When a Sura comes down enjoining them to believe in God and strive along with His Messenger, those with wealth and influence among them ask for exemption and say, "Leave us behind." They prefer to be with those who remain behind at home; their hearts are sealed and they understand not. But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and persons; for them are all good things and they will prosper. God has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. And among the desert Arabs, there were men who made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to God and His Messenger merely sat inactive. Soon a grievous penalty will seize the unbelievers among them.Dwellers of the desert came seeking permission to stay behind, lying to God and His Messenger; a painful chastisement shall afflict those who disbelieved. There is no blame on the infirm, ill, or those without resources if they are sincere to God and His Messenger. God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Nor is there blame on those who came to you for mounts, and when you said, "I can find no mounts for you," they turned back with tears of grief for not having resources. The blame is on those who claim exemption while being rich, preferring to stay behind. God has sealed their hearts, so they know not. They will present excuses when you return to them. Say, "Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. God has informed us of your true state. Your actions will be observed by God and His Messenger, and you will be brought back to Him who knows the hidden and the open." They will swear by God to be left alone. Leave them alone; they are unclean, and Hell is their dwelling place. They will swear to please you, but God is not pleased with the disobedient. The desert Arabs are the worst in unbelief and hypocrisy, ignorant of God's commands. Some see their payments as a fine and await disasters for you. On them be the disaster of evil. But some believe in God and the Last Day, seeing their payments as pious gifts. God will admit them to His Mercy. The vanguard of Islam, the first to forsake their homes and those who aided them, and those who follow in good deeds, are well-pleased with God, and He with them. For them are gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to dwell therein forever. Certain desert Arabs and Medina folk are hypocrites, obstinate in hypocrisy. God knows them, and they will be punished twice and then sent to a grievous penalty. Others have acknowledged their wrongdoings, mixing good with evil. Perhaps God will turn to them in mercy. Take alms from their goods to purify and sanctify them, and pray for them. God hears and knows. Know that God accepts repentance and charity. Say, "Work righteousness; God, His Messenger, and the believers will observe your work. You will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, who will inform you of your deeds." Others are held in suspense for God's command, whether He will punish them or turn in mercy to them. God is All-Knowing, Wise.Others await God's decree, whether He will punish them or forgive them. God is Knower, Wise. Some built a mosque to cause harm and disunity among believers, swearing their intentions were good, but God declares them liars. Never stand in such a mosque; a mosque founded on piety from the first day is more deserving. In it are men who love to be purified, and God loves those who purify themselves. Is he who lays his foundation on piety better, or he who lays it on a crumbling sand-cliff? The latter's foundation will always be shaky. God has purchased from believers their lives and goods in exchange for Paradise. They fight in His cause, slay and are slain, a promise binding on Him in the Torah, Gospel, and Qur'an. Rejoice in this supreme achievement. Those who turn to God in repentance, serve Him, praise Him, and observe His limits are given glad tidings. It is not fitting for the Prophet and believers to pray for forgiveness for pagans after it is clear they are companions of the Fire. Abraham prayed for his father's forgiveness due to a promise, but when it became clear his father was an enemy to God, he dissociated himself. God will not mislead a people after guiding them until He makes clear what to avoid. God's dominion includes the heavens and the earth; He gives life and takes it. God turned in mercy to the Prophet, the Muhajirs, and the Ansar who followed him in distress. He also turned in mercy to the three who were left behind, making them realize there is no refuge from God but in Him. O believers, fear God and be with the truthful. It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs to refuse to follow God's Messenger or prefer their own lives to his. Every suffering or deed in God's cause is credited as righteousness.
...till God bringeth His command to pass. God guideth not wrongdoing folk. S: Say: If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your mates and your kinsfolk and property which you have acquired, and the slackness of trade which you fear and dwellings which you like, are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and striving in His way, then wait till God brings about His command: and God does not guide the transgressing people.

009.025 Y: Assuredly God did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land, for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat. P: God hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of Huneyn, when ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught, and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you; then ye turned back in flight; S: Certainly God helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you vain, but they availed you nothing and the earth became strait to you notwithstanding its spaciousness, then you turned back retreating.

009.026 Y: But God did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers, and sent down forces which ye saw not: He punished the Unbelievers; thus doth He reward those without Faith. P: Then God sent His peace of reassurance down upon His messenger and upon the believers, and sent down hosts ye could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such is the reward of disbelievers. S: Then God sent down His tranquillity upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and sent down hosts which you did not see, and chastised those who disbelieved, and that is the reward of the unbelievers.

009.027 Y: Again will God, after this, turn (in mercy) to whom He will: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: Then afterward God will relent toward whom He will; for God is Forgiving, Merciful. S: Then will God after this turn (mercifully) to whom He pleases, and God is Forgiving, Merciful.

009.028 Y: O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will God enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. P: O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean. So let them not come near the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year. If ye fear poverty (from the loss of their merchandise) God shall preserve you of His bounty if He will. Lo! God is Knower, Wise. S: O you who believe! the idolaters are nothing but unclean, so they shall not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year; and if you fear poverty then God will enrich you out of His grace if He please; surely God is Knowing Wise.

009.029 Y: Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. P: Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in God nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which God hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low. S: Fight those who do not believe in God, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what God and His Messenger have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.

009.030 Y: The Jews call 'Uzair a son of God, and the Christians call Christ the son of God. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. God's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth! P: And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of God, and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of God. That is their saying with their mouths. They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved of old. God (Himself) fighteth against them. How perverse are they! S: And the Jews say: Uzair is the son of God; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of God; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may God destroy them; how they are turned away!

009.031 Y: They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of God, and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One God: there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him). P: They have taken as lords beside God their rabbis and their monks and the Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One God. There is no God save Him. Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! S: They have taken their doctors of law and their monks for lords besides God, and (also) the Messiah son of Marium and they were enjoined that they should serve one God only, there is no god but He; far from His glory be what they set up (with Him).

009.032 Y: Fain would they extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God will not allow but that His light should be perfected, even though the Unbelievers may detest (it). P: Fain would they put out the light of God with their mouths, but God disdaineth (aught) save that He shall perfect His light, however much the disbelievers are averse. S: They desire to put out the light of God with their mouths, and God will not consent save to perfect His light, though the unbelievers are averse.

009.033 Y: It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion, even though the Pagans may detest (it). P: He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the idolaters may be averse. S: He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, that He might cause it to prevail over all religions, though the polytheists may be averse.

009.034 Y: O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites, who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder (them) from the way of God. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God: announce unto them a most grievous penalty- P: O ye who believe! Lo! many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar (men) from the way of God. They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God, unto them give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom, S: O you who believe! most surely many of the doctors of law and the monks eat away the property of men falsely, and turn (them) from God's way; and (as for) those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in God's way, announce to them a painful chastisement,

009.035 Y: On the Day when heat will be produced out of that (wealth) in the fire of Hell, and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, their flanks, and their backs.- "This is the (treasure) which ye buried for yourselves: taste ye, then, the (treasures) ye buried!" P: On the day when it will (all) be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith (and it will be said unto them): Here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what ye used to hoard. S: On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, then their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it; this is what you hoarded up for yourselves, therefore taste what you hoarded.

009.036 Y: The number of months in the sight of God is twelve (in a year)- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred: that is the straight usage. So wrong not yourselves therein, and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that God is with those who restrain themselves. P: Lo! the number of the months with God is twelve months by God's ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are sacred: that is the right religion. So wrong not yourselves in them. And wage war on all of the idolaters as they are waging war on all of you. And know that God is with those who keep their duty (unto Him). S: Surely the number of months with God is twelve months in God's ordinance since the day when He created the heavens and the earth, of these four being sacred; that is the right reckoning; therefore be not unjust to yourselves regarding them, and fight the polytheists all together as they fight you all together; and know that God is with those who guard (against evil).

009.037 Y: Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief: the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year, and forbidden another year, in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by God and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But God guideth not those who reject Faith. P: Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an excess of disbelief whereby those who disbelieve are misled; they allow it one year and forbid it (another) year, that they may make up the number of the months which God hath hallowed, so that they allow that which God hath forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made fairseeming unto them. God guideth not the disbelieving folk. S: Postponing (of the sacred month) is only an addition in unbelief, wherewith those who disbelieve are led astray, violating it one year and keeping it sacred another, that they may agree in the number (of months) that God has made sacred, and thus violate what God has made sacred; the evil of their doings is made fairseeming to them; and God does not guide the unbelieving people.

009.038 Y: O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of God, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. P: O ye who believe! What aileth you that when it is said unto you: Go forth in the way of God, ye are bowed down to the ground with heaviness. Take ye pleasure in the life of the world rather than in the Hereafter? The comfort of the life of the world is but little in the Hereafter. S: O you who believe! What (excuse) have you that when it is said to you: Go forth in God's way, you should incline heavily to earth; are you contented with this world's life instead of the hereafter? But the provision of this world's life compared with the hereafter is but little.The dwellers of the desert should not remain behind the Messenger of God, nor should they desire anything for themselves in preference to him. Any thirst, fatigue, or hunger they endure in God's way, or any path they tread that enrages the unbelievers, or any gain they achieve from the enemy, is recorded as a good deed. God does not waste the reward of the doers of good. Nor could they spend anything, small or great, for the cause, nor cut across a valley, but the deed is inscribed to their credit so that God may reward them with the best possible reward.

Believers should not all go forth together; a contingent from every expedition should remain behind to devote themselves to religious studies and admonish the people when they return, so they may guard themselves against evil. O believers, fight the unbelievers who are near you and let them find firmness in you, and know that God is with those who fear Him.

Whenever a sura is revealed, some say, "Which of you has had his faith increased by it?" Those who believe have their faith increased and they rejoice. But those with a disease in their hearts have their doubt increased, and they die in a state of unbelief. Do they not see they are tested every year once or twice? Yet they do not turn in repentance nor take heed. Whenever a sura is revealed, they look at each other and say, "Does anyone see you?" Then they turn aside. God has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not understand.

A Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; it grieves him that you should perish. He is ardently anxious over you and is most kind and merciful to the believers. But if they turn away, say, "God suffices me; there is no god but He. On Him is my trust, and He is the Lord of the Throne Supreme."

Chapter 10: YUNUS (JONAH)
Total Verses: 109
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A.L.R. These are the ayats of the Book of Wisdom. Is it a wonder to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves, that he should warn mankind and give good news to the believers that they have a lofty rank of truth before their Lord? The disbelievers say, "This is indeed an evident sorcerer!"

Verily, your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the throne of authority, regulating all things. No intercessor can plead with Him except after His leave. This is God, your Lord; serve Him. Will you not receive admonition? To Him will be your return, all of you. The promise of God is true and sure. He begins the process of creation and repeats it to reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness. Those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids and a grievous penalty because they rejected Him.

He made the sun a shining glory and the moon a light, and measured out stages for her so that you might know the number of years and the count of time. God created this in truth and righteousness. He explains His signs in detail for those who understand. In the alternation of the night and the day, and in all that God has created in the heavens and the earth, are signs for those who fear Him.

Those who do not hope for their meeting with Us and are pleased with the life of the present, and those who heed not Our signs, their abode is the Fire because of the evil they earned. Those who believe and work righteousness, their Lord will guide them because of their faith. Beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss. Their cry therein will be, "Glory to Thee, O God!" and "Peace" will be their greeting therein. The close of their cry will be, "Praise be to God, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds."Their prayer therein will be: "Glory be to Thee, O God!" and their greeting therein will be: "Peace." And the conclusion of their prayer will be: "Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds!"

If God were to hasten for men the ill they have earned as they would hasten on the good, their respite would already have expired. But We leave those who do not hope for their meeting with Us to wander blindly in their trespasses.

When trouble touches a man, he cries unto Us in all postures—lying down, sitting, or standing. But when We solve his trouble, he passes on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him. Thus, the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes.

Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong; their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they would not believe. Thus do We requite those who sin.

Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how you would behave.

When Our clear signs are rehearsed unto them, those who do not hope for their meeting with Us say, "Bring us a reading other than this, or change this." Say: "It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it. I follow only what is revealed unto me. If I were to disobey my Lord, I would fear the penalty of a Great Day."

Say: "If God had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole lifetime before this, I have tarried amongst you. Will you not then understand?"

Who does more wrong than such as forge a lie against God or deny His signs? But those who sin will never prosper.

They serve, besides God, things that neither hurt them nor profit them, and they say, "These are our intercessors with God." Say: "Do you indeed inform God of something He knows not in the heavens or on earth? Glory to Him! He is far above the partners they ascribe to Him!"

Mankind was but one nation, but they differed later. Had it not been for a word that went forth from your Lord, their differences would have been settled between them.

They say, "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "The Unseen is only for God to know. Then wait, I too will wait with you."

When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity has touched them, behold! they plot against Our signs. Say: "Swifter to plan is God! Verily, Our messengers record all the plots you make."

He it is Who enables you to traverse through land and sea. When you board ships, they sail with a favorable wind, and you rejoice. Then comes a stormy wind, and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are being overwhelmed. They cry unto God, sincerely offering their duty unto Him, saying, "If You deliver us from this, we shall truly show our gratitude!"

But when He delivers them, behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right. O mankind! Your insolence is against your own souls, an enjoyment of the life of the present. In the end, to Us is your return, and We shall show you the truth of all that you did.

The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies. By its mingling arises the produce of the earth, which provides food for men and animals. It grows till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out in beauty. The people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it. Then Our command reaches it by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who reflect.It is God who calls to the Home of Peace and guides whom He pleases to a straight path. For those who do right, there is a goodly reward, and more. No darkness or shame shall cover their faces; they are companions of the garden and will abide therein forever. But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil; ignominy will cover their faces, and they will have no defender from God. Their faces will be covered with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night; they are companions of the Fire and will abide therein forever.

One day, We will gather them all together and say to those who joined gods with Us, "To your place! You and those you joined as 'partners'." We will separate them, and their 'partners' will say, "It was not us that you worshipped!" God suffices as a witness between us and you; we were unaware of your worship. Every soul will prove the deeds it sent before and will be brought back to God, their rightful Lord, and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch.

Say: "Who sustains you from the sky and the earth? Who has power over hearing and sight? Who brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living? Who rules and regulates all affairs?" They will say, "God." Say, "Will you not then show piety to Him?" This is God, your real Cherisher and Sustainer. Apart from truth, what remains but error? How then are you turned away?

Thus, the word of your Lord is proved true against those who rebel; they will not believe. Say: "Of your 'partners,' can any originate creation and repeat it?" Say: "It is God who originates creation and repeats it. How then are you deluded away from the truth?" Say: "Of your 'partners,' is there any that can give guidance towards truth?" Say: "It is God who gives guidance towards truth. Is He who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you? How do you judge?"

Most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Truly, conjecture can be of no avail against the truth. Verily, God is well aware of all that they do. This Qur'an is not such as can be produced by other than God; it is a confirmation of revelations that went before it and a fuller explanation of the Book, wherein there is no doubt, from the Lord of the worlds. Or do they say, "He forged it"? Say: "Bring then a surah like unto it, and call anyone you can besides God, if you speak the truth!"

Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof has reached them. Thus did those before them make charges of falsehood, but see what was the end of those who did wrong! Of them, some believe therein, and some do not. Your Lord knows best those who are out for mischief. If they charge you with falsehood, say: "My work to me, and yours to you! You are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what you do!"

Among them are some who pretend to listen to you, but can you make the deaf hear, even though they are without understanding? And among them are some who look at you, but can you guide the blind, even though they will not see? Verily, God will not deal unjustly with man in aught; it is man that wrongs his own soul. One day, He will gather them together; it will be as if they had tarried but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other. Assuredly, those will be lost who denied the meeting with God and refused to be guided.t little. 009.039 Y: Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For God hath power over all things. P: If ye go not forth He will afflict you with a painful doom, and will choose instead of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot harm Him at all. God is Able to do all things. S: If you do not go forth, He will chastise you with a painful chastisement and bring in your place a people other than you, and you will do Him no harm; and God has power over all things.

009.040 Y: If ye help not (your leader), (it is no matter): for God did indeed help him, when the Unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion; they two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, "Have no fear, for God is with us": then God sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of God is exalted to the heights: for God is Exalted in Might, Wise. P: If ye help him not, still God helped him when those who disbelieve drove him forth, the second of two; when they two were in the cave, when he said unto his comrade: Grieve not. Lo! God is with us. Then God caused His peace of reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see, and made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost, while God's Word it was that became the uppermost. God is Mighty, Wise. S: If you will not aid him, God certainly aided him when those who disbelieved expelled him, he being the second of the two, when they were both in the cave, when he said to his companion: Grieve not, surely God is with us. So God sent down His tranquillity upon him and strengthened him with hosts which you did not see, and made lowest the word of those who disbelieved; and the word of God, that is the highest; and God is Mighty, Wise.

009.041 Y: Go ye forth, (whether equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle, with your goods and your persons, in the cause of God. That is best for you, if ye (but) knew. P: Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of God! That is best for you if ye but knew. S: Go forth light and heavy, and strive hard in God's way with your property and your persons; this is better for you, if you know.

009.042 Y: If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them. They would indeed swear by God, "If we only could, we should certainly have come out with you": They would destroy their own souls; for God doth know that they are certainly lying. P: Had it been a near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee, but the distance seemed too far for them. Yet will they swear by God (saying): If we had been able we would surely have set out with you. They destroy their souls, and God knoweth that they verily are liars. S: Had it been a near advantage and a short journey, they would certainly have followed you, but the tedious journey was too long for them; and they swear by God: If we had been able, we would certainly have gone forth with you; they cause their own souls to perish, and God knows that they are most surely liars.

009.043 Y: God give thee grace! why didst thou grant them exemption until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light, and thou hadst proved the liars? P: God forgive thee (O Muhammad)! Wherefore didst thou grant them leave ere those who told the truth were manifest to thee and thou didst know the liars? S: God pardon you! Why did you give them leave until those who spoke the truth had become manifest to you and you had known the liars?

009.044 Y: Those who believe in God and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons. And God knoweth well those who do their duty. P: Those who believe in God and the Last Day ask no leave of thee lest they should strive with their wealth and their lives. God is Aware of those who keep their duty (unto Him). S: They do not ask leave of you who believe in God and the latter day (to stay away) from striving hard with their property and their persons, and God knows those who guard (against evil).

009.045 Y: Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in God and the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro. P: They alone ask leave of thee who believe not in God and the Last Day, and whose hearts feel doubt, so in their doubt they waver. S: They only ask leave of you who do not believe in God and the latter day and their hearts are in doubt, so in their doubt do they waver.

009.046 Y: If they had intended to come out, they would certainly have made some preparation therefor; but God was averse to their being sent forth; so He made them lag behind, and they were told, "Sit ye among those who sit (inactive)." P: And if they had wished to go forth they would assuredly have made ready some equipment, but God was averse to their being sent forth and held them back and it was said (unto them): Sit ye with the sedentary! S: And if they had intended to go forth, they would certainly have provided equipment for it, but God did not like their going forth, so He withheld them, and it was said (to them): Hold back with those who hold back.

009.047 Y: If they had come out with you, they would not have added to your (strength) but only (made for) disorder, hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you, and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. But God knoweth well those who do wrong. P: Had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble and had hurried to and fro among you, seeking to cause sedition among you; and among you there are some who would have listened to them. God is Aware of evil-doers. S: Had they gone forth with you, they would not have added to you aught save corruption, and they would certainly have hurried about among you seeking (to sow) dissension among you, and among you there are those who hearken for their sake; and God knows the unjust.

009.048 Y: Indeed they had plotted sedition before, and upset matters for thee, until,- the Truth arrived, and the Decree of God became manifest much to their disgust. P: Aforetime they sought to cause sedition and raised difficulties for thee till the Truth came and the decree of God was made manifest, though they were loth. S: Certainly they sought (to sow) dissension before, and they meditated plots against you until the truth came, and God's commandment prevailed although they were averse (from it).

009.049 Y: Among them is (many) a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already? and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides). P: Of them is he who saith: Grant me leave (to stay at home) and tempt me not. Surely it is into temptation that they (thus) have fallen. Lo! hell verily is all around the disbelievers. S: And among them there is he who says: Allow me and do not try me. Surely into trial have they already tumbled down, and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers.

009.050 Y: If good befalls thee, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee, they say, "We took indeed our precautions beforehand," and they turn away rejoicing. P: If good befalleth thee (O Muhammad) it afflicteth them, and if calamity befalleth thee, they say: We took precaution, and they turn away well pleased. S: If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if hardship afflicts you, they say: Indeed we had taken care of our affair before; and they turn back and are glad.

009.051 Y: Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what God has decreed for us: He is our protector": and on God let the Believers put their trust. P: Say: Naught befalleth us save that which God hath decreed for us. He is our Protecting Friend. In God let believers put their trust! S: Say: Nothing will afflict us save what God has ordained for us; He is our Patron; and on God let the believers rely.

009.052 Y: Say: "Can you expect for us (any fate) other than one of two glorious things- (Martyrdom or victory)? But we can expect for you either that God will send his punishment from Himself, or by our hands. So wait (expectant); we too will wait with you." P: Say: Can ye await for us aught save one of two good things (death or victory in God's way)? while we await for you that God will afflict you with a doom from Him or at our hands. Await then! Lo! We are awaiting with you. S: Say: Do you await for us but one of two most excellent things? And we await for you that God will afflict you with punishment from Himself or by our hands. So wait; we too will wait with you.

009.053 Y: Say: "Spend (for the cause) willingly or unwillingly: not from you will it be accepted: for ye are indeed a people rebellious and wicked." P: Say: Pay (your contribution), willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Lo! ye were ever froward folk. S: Say: Spend willingly or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted from you; surely you are a transgressing people.

009.054 Y: The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are: that they reject God and His Messenger; that they come to prayer without earnestness; and that they offer contributions unwillingly. P: And naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them save that they have disbelieved in God and in His messenger, and they come not to worship save as idlers, and pay not (their contribution) save reluctantly. S: And nothing hinders their spendings being accepted from them, except that they disbelieve in God and in His Messenger and they do not come to prayer but while they are sluggish, and they do not spend but while they are unwilling.

009.055 Y: Let not their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: in reality God's plan is to punish them with these things in this life, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of God. P: So let not their riches nor their children please thee (O Muhammad). God thereby intendeth but to punish them in the life of the world and that their souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers. S: Let not then their property and their children excite your admiration; God only wishes to chastise them with these in this world's life and (that) their souls may depart while they are unbelievers.

009.056 Y: They swear by God that they are indeed of you; but they are not of you: yet they are afraid (to appear in their true colours). P: And they swear by God that they are in truth of you, when they are not of you, but they are folk who are afraid. S: And they swear by God that they are most surely of you, and they are not of you, but thAnd on the day when He shall gather them together, it will seem as though they had tarried but an hour of the day, recognizing one another. Those who denied the meeting with God and refused to be guided will perish. Whether We show you some part of what We promise them or take your soul before that, to Us is their return. God is witness to all that they do. Every people had a messenger, and when their messenger comes, the matter will be judged with justice, and they will not be wronged. They ask, "When will this promise come to pass if you speak the truth?" Say: "I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except as God wills. Every people has a term appointed; when their term is reached, they cannot delay or advance it." Say: "Do you see if His punishment comes to you by night or by day? What portion of it would the sinners wish to hasten?" When it comes to pass, will you believe in it? It will be said: "Taste the enduring punishment; you get but the recompense of what you earned." They ask: "Is that true?" Say: "Yes, by my Lord, it is the truth, and you cannot escape." Every soul that has sinned would give all it possesses as ransom. They will declare their repentance when they see the penalty, but the judgment will be with justice, and no wrong will be done to them. To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth. God's promise is true, but most of them understand not. He gives life and causes death, and to Him you shall be brought back. O mankind! There has come to you a direction from your Lord and a healing for the diseases in your hearts, and for those who believe, a guidance and a mercy. Say: "In the bounty of God and His mercy, let them rejoice; it is better than what they hoard." Say: "See what things God has sent down to you for sustenance, yet you hold some things forbidden and some lawful." Say: "Has God indeed permitted you, or do you invent things to attribute to God?" What will be the thought of those who invent lies against God on the Day of Judgment? God is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful. In whatever business you may be, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur'an, and whatever deed you may be doing, We are witnesses thereof when you are deeply engrossed therein. Nothing is hidden from your Lord, not even the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven. Behold! Verily on the friends of God, there is no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who believe and constantly guard against evil will have glad tidings in this life and the Hereafter. There is no changing the words of God; this is indeed the supreme felicity. Let not their speech grieve you; all power and honor belong to God. He hears and knows all things. To God belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth. Those who worship partners besides God follow nothing but fancy and lies. He has made the night for rest and the day to make things visible. Verily in this are signs for those who listen.They are a people who are afraid of you. If they could find a place to flee to, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightaway thereto, with an obstinate rush. Among them are men who slander you in the matter of alms: if they are given part thereof, they are pleased, but if not, they are indignant. If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger gave them, and had said, "Sufficient unto us is God! God and His Messenger will soon give us of His bounty: to God do we turn our hopes!" Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the funds; for those whose hearts have been recently reconciled to Truth; for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of God; and for the wayfarer: thus is it ordained by God, and God is full of knowledge and wisdom. Among them are men who molest the Prophet and say, "He is all ear." Say, "He listens to what is best for you: he believes in God, has faith in the Believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." But those who molest the Messenger will have a grievous penalty. To you they swear by God in order to please you: but it is more fitting that they should please God and His Messenger, if they are Believers. Know they not that for those who oppose God and His Messenger, is the Fire of Hell? The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them, showing them what is really passing in their hearts. Say, "Mock ye! But verily God will bring to light all that ye fear should be revealed." If thou dost question them, they declare, "We were only talking idly and in play." Say, "Was it at God, and His Signs, and His Messenger, that ye were mocking?" Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are in sin. The Hypocrites, men and women, have an understanding with each other: they enjoin evil, and forbid what is just, and are close with their hands. They have forgotten God; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse. God hath promised the Hypocrites men and women, and the rejecters of Faith, the fire of Hell: therein shall they dwell. Sufficient is it for them: for them is the curse of God, and an enduring punishment. As in the case of those before you: they were mightier than you in power, and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of their portion: and ye have of yours, as did those before you; and ye indulge in idle talk as they did. They! Their work is fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will lose all spiritual good. Hath not the story reached them of those before them? The People of Noah, and 'Ad, and Thamud; the People of Abraham, the men of Midian, and the cities overthrown. To them came their messengers with clear signs. It is not God Who wrongs them, but they wrong their own souls. The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practice regular charity, and obey God and His Messenger. On them will God pour His mercy: for God is Exalted in Power, Wise. God hath promised to Believers, men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of God: that is the supreme felicity.O Prophet! Strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell, an evil refuge indeed. They swear by God that they said nothing evil, but indeed they uttered blasphemy after accepting Islam; and they plotted what they could not carry out. If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back, God will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter. Among them are men who made a covenant with God, that if He bestowed on them of His bounty, they would give in charity and be righteous. But when He did bestow His bounty, they became covetous and turned back. So He has put hypocrisy into their hearts until the Day they shall meet Him, because they broke their covenant with God and lied. Do they not know that God knows their secret thoughts and counsels? Those who slander the believers who give freely to charity and those who can only give a little, God will throw back their ridicule on them, and they shall have a grievous penalty. Whether you ask for their forgiveness or not, God will not forgive them because they have rejected Him and His Messenger. Those who were left behind in the Tabuk expedition rejoiced in their inaction and hated to strive in the cause of God. Say, 'The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat.' Let them laugh a little and weep much as a recompense for their deeds. If God brings you back to any of them and they ask to come out with you, say, 'Never shall you come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me.' Nor pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave, for they rejected God and His Messenger. Let not their wealth or children dazzle you; God's plan is to punish them with these things in this world and that their souls may perish in their denial of God. When a Sura comes down enjoining them to believe in God and strive along with His Messenger, those with wealth and influence among them ask for exemption. They prefer to be with those who remain behind; their hearts are sealed, so they understand not. But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and persons; for them are all good things, and they will prosper. God has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein. And among the desert Arabs, men made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to God and His Messenger sat inactive. Soon a grievous penalty will seize the unbelievers among them."He it is Who made for you the night that you might rest in it, and the day giving light; most surely there are signs in it for a people who would hear. They say: "God hath begotten a son!" - Glory be to Him! He is self-sufficient! His are all things in the heavens and on earth! No warrant have ye for this! Say ye about God what ye know not? They say: God hath taken (unto Him) a son - Glorified be He! He hath no needs! His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Ye have no warrant for this. Tell ye concerning God that which ye know not? They say: God has taken a son (to Himself)! Glory be to Him: He is the Self-sufficient: His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; you have no authority for this; do you say against God what you do not know? Say: "Those who invent a lie against God will never prosper." Say: Verily those who invent a lie concerning God will not succeed. Say: Those who forge a lie against God shall not be successful. A little enjoyment in this world!- and then, to Us will be their return, then shall We make them taste the severest penalty for their blasphemies. This world's portion (will be theirs), then unto Us is their return. Then We make them taste a dreadful doom because they used to disbelieve. (It is only) a provision in this world, then to Us shall be their return; then We shall make them taste severe punishment because they disbelieved. Relate to them the story of Noah. Behold! he said to his people: "O my people, if it be hard on your (mind) that I should stay (with you) and commemorate the signs of God,- yet I put my trust in God. Get ye then an agreement about your plan and among your partners, so your plan be on to you dark and dubious. Then pass your sentence on me, and give me no respite." Recite unto them the story of Noah, when he told his people: O my people! If my sojourn (here) and my reminding you by God's revelations are an offence unto you, in God have I put my trust, so decide upon your course of action you and your partners. Let not your course of action be in doubt for you. Then have at me, give me no respite. And recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his people: O my people! if my stay and my reminding (you) by the communications of God is hard on you yet on God do I rely then resolve upon your affair and (gather) your associates, then let not your affair remain dubious to you, then have it executed against me and give me no respite: "But if ye turn back, (consider): no reward have I asked of you: my reward is only due from God, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God's will (in Islam)." But if ye are averse I have asked of you no wage. My wage is the concern of God only, and I am commanded to be of those who surrender (unto Him). But if you turn back, I did not ask for any reward from you; my reward is only with God, and I am commanded that I should be of those who submit. They rejected Him, but We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We made them inherit (the earth), while We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our Signs. Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but heeded not)! But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and made them viceroys (in the earth), while We drowned those who denied Our revelations. See then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned. But they rejected him, so We delivered him and those with him in the ark, and We made them rulers and drowned those who rejected Our communications; see then what was the end of the (people) warned. Then after him We sent (many) messengers to their peoples: they brought them Clear Signs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors. Then, after him, We sent messengers unto their folk, and they brought them clear proofs. But they were not ready to believe in that which they before denied. Thus print We on the hearts of the transgressors. Then did We raise up after him messengers to their people, so they came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe in what they had rejected before; thus it is that We set seals upon the hearts of those who exceed the limits. Then after them sent We Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they were arrogant: they were a people in sin. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our revelations, but they were arrogant and were a guilty folk. Then did We send up after them Musa and Haroun to Firon and his chiefs with Our signs, but they showed pride and they were a guilty people. When the Truth did come to them from Us, they said: "This is indeed evident sorcery!" And when the Truth from Our presence came unto them, they said: Lo! this is mere magic. So when the truth came to them from Us they said: This is most surely clear enchantment! Said Moses: "Say ye (this) about the truth when it hath (actually) reached you? Is sorcery (like) this? But sorcerers will not prosper." Moses said: Speak ye (so) of the Truth when it hath come unto you? Is this magic? Now magicians thrive not. Musa said: Do you say (this) of the truth when it has come to you? Is it magic? And the magicians are not successful. They said: "Hast thou come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following,- in order that thou and thy brother may have greatness in the land? But not we shall believe in you!" They said: Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that (faith) in which we found our fathers, and that you two may own the place of greatness in the land? We will not believe you two. They said: Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers upon, and (that) greatness in the land should be for you two? And we are not going to believe in you. Said Pharaoh: "Bring me every sorcerer well versed." And Pharaoh said: Bring every cunning wizard unto me. And Firon said: Bring to me every skillful magician. When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: "Throw ye what ye (wish) to throw!" And when the wizards came, Moses said unto them: Cast your cast! And when the magicians came, Musa said to them: Cast down what you have to cast. When they had had their throw, Moses said: "What ye have brought is sorcery: God will surely make it of no effect: for God prospereth not the work of those who make mischief." And when they had cast, Moses said: That which ye have brought is magic. Lo! God will make it vain. Lo! God upholdeth not the work of mischief-makers. So when they cast down, Musa said to them: What you have brought is deception; surely God will make it naught; surely God does not make the work of mischief-makers to thrive. "And God by His words doth prove and establish His truth, however much the sinners may hate it!" And God will vindicate the Truth by His words, however much the guilty be averse. And God will show the truth to be the truth by His words, though the guilty may be averse (to it). But none believed in Moses except some children of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharaoh was mighty on the earth and one who transgressed all bounds. But none trusted Moses, save some scions of his people, (and they were) in fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs, that he would persecute them. Lo! Pharaoh was verily a tyrant in the land, and lo! he verily was of the wanton. But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, on account of the fear of Firon and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them; and most surely Firon was lofty in the land; and most surely he was of the extravagant. Moses said: "O my people! If ye do (really) believe in God, then in Him put your trust if ye submit (your will to His)." And Moses said: O my people! If ye have believed in God then put trust in Him, if ye have indeed surrendered (unto Him)! And Musa said: O my people! if you believe in God, then rely on Him (alone) if you submit (to God). They said: "In God do we put out trust. Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who practise oppression;" They said: In God we put trust. Our Lord! Oh, make us not a lure for the wrongdoing folk; So they said: On God we rely: O our Lord! make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people: "And deliver us by Thy Mercy from those who reject (Thee)." And, of Thy mercy, save us from the folk that disbelieve. And do Thou deliver us by Thy mercy from the unbelieving people. We inspired Moses and his brother with this Message: "Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, make your dwellings into places of worship, and establish regular prayers: and give glad tidings to those who believe!" And We inspired Moses and his brother, (saying): Appoint houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses oratories, and establish worship. And give good news to the believers. And We revealed to Musa and his brother, saying: Take for your people houses to abide in Egypt and make your houses places of worship and keep up prayer and give good news to the believers. Moses prayed: "Our Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of the present, and so, Our Lord, they mislead (men) from Thy Path. Deface our Lord, the features of their wealth, and send hardness to their hearts, so they will not believe until they see the grievous penalty." And Moses said: Our Lord! Lo! Thou hast given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and riches in the life of the world, Our Lord! that they may lead men astray from Thy way. Our Lord! Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not till they see the painful doom. And Musa said: Our Lord! surely Thou hast given to Firon and his chiefs finery and riches in this world's life, to this end, our Lord, that they lead (people) astray from Thy way: Our Lord! destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not until they see the painful punishment. God said: "Accepted is your prayer (O Moses and Aaron)! So stand ye straight, and follow not the path of those who know not." He said: Your prayer is heard. Do ye twain keep to the straight path, and follow not the road of those who have no knowledge. He said: The prayer of you both has indeed been accepted, therefore continue in the right way and do not follow the path of those who do not know. We took the Children of Israel across the sea: Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite. At length, when over"We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts pursued them in rebellion and transgression. When drowning overtook him, he exclaimed: 'I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in, and I am of those who submit.' (It was said to him): 'Ah now! But a little while before, you were in rebellion and did mischief!' 'This day We shall save you in your body, that you may be a sign to those who come after you. But many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!' We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place and provided them with sustenance of the best. It was after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms. God will judge between them as to the schisms among them on the Day of Judgment. If you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Book from before you. The Truth has indeed come to you from your Lord, so be not of those in doubt. Nor be of those who reject the signs of God, or you shall be of those who perish. Those against whom the word of your Lord has been verified would not believe, even if every Sign was brought to them, until they see the penalty grievous. Why was there not a single township among those We warned, which believed, so its faith should have profited it, except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the penalty of ignominy in the life of the present and permitted them to enjoy their life for a while. If it had been your Lord's will, they would all have believed, all who are on earth! Will you then compel mankind, against their will, to believe? No soul can believe except by the will of God, and He will place doubt on those who will not understand. Say: 'Behold all that is in the heavens and on earth.' But neither Signs nor Warners profit those who believe not. Do they then expect anything but what happened in the days of the men who passed away before them? Say: 'Wait then, for I too will wait with you.' In the end, We deliver Our messengers and those who believe. Thus it is fitting on Our part that We should deliver those who believe. Say: 'O mankind! If you are in doubt as to my religion, I worship not what you worship other than God. But I worship God, Who will take your souls at death. I am commanded to be in the ranks of the Believers.' And further: 'Set your face towards religion with true piety, and never be of the Unbelievers. Nor call on any other than God; such will neither profit you nor hurt you. If you do, you shall certainly be of those who do wrong.' If God touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He. If He designs some benefit for you, there is none who can keep back His favor. He causes it to reach whomsoever of His servants He pleases. He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: 'O mankind! Now Truth has reached you from your Lord. Those who receive guidance do so for the good of their own souls. Those who stray do so to their own loss. I am not set over you to arrange your affairs.' Follow the inspiration sent to you and be patient and constant until God decides, for He is the best to decide."God; surely I am a warner for you from Him and a giver of good news. Seek the forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance; that He may grant you enjoyment for a term appointed and bestow His grace on all who abound in merit. But if you turn away, then I fear for you the penalty of a great day. To God is your return, and He has power over all things. They fold up their hearts to hide from Him, but He knows what they conceal and reveal. There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance depends on God. He created the heavens and the earth in six days to try you, which of you is best in conduct. If you say, "You shall be raised up after death," the unbelievers will say, "This is obvious sorcery!" If We delay the penalty for them, they will say, "What keeps it back?" On the day it reaches them, nothing will turn it away. If We give man a taste of mercy and then withdraw it, he falls into despair and blasphemy. But if We give him a taste of favors after adversity, he exults and boasts. Not so do those who show patience and work righteousness; for them is forgiveness and a great reward. You are only a warner; God arranges all affairs. If they say, "He forged it," say, "Bring ten suras like it and call whomsoever you can besides God, if you speak the truth." If they do not answer, know that it is revealed by God's knowledge. Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter will be repaid their deeds without diminution. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire. Can they be like those who accept a clear sign from their Lord? Those who invent a lie against God will be turned back to Him, and the witnesses will say, "These are the ones who lied against their Lord!" The curse of God is on those who do wrong. They hinder men from the path of God and seek to make it crooked. They will not frustrate His design on earth, nor have they protectors besides God. Their penalty will be doubled. They lost the power to hear and did not see. They are the ones who have lost their own souls, and the fancies they invented have left them in the lurch."O Prophet! Strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell, an evil refuge indeed. They swear by God that they said nothing evil, but indeed they uttered blasphemy after accepting Islam; and they plotted what they could not carry out. If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back, God will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter. Among them are men who made a covenant with God, that if He bestowed on them of His bounty, they would give in charity and be righteous. But when He did bestow His bounty, they became covetous and turned back. So He has put hypocrisy into their hearts until the Day they shall meet Him, because they broke their covenant with God and lied. Do they not know that God knows their secret thoughts and counsels? Those who slander the believers who give freely to charity and those who can only give a little, God will throw back their ridicule on them, and they shall have a grievous penalty. Whether you ask for their forgiveness or not, God will not forgive them because they have rejected Him and His Messenger. Those who were left behind in the Tabuk expedition rejoiced in their inaction and hated to strive in the cause of God. Say, 'The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat.' Let them laugh a little and weep much as a recompense for their deeds. If God brings you back to any of them and they ask to come out with you, say, 'Never shall you come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me.' Nor pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave, for they rejected God and His Messenger. Let not their wealth or children dazzle you; God's plan is to punish them with these things in this world and that their souls may perish in their denial of God. When a Sura comes down enjoining them to believe in God and strive along with His Messenger, those with wealth and influence among them ask for exemption. They prefer to be with those who remain behind; their hearts are sealed, so they understand not. But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and persons; for them are all good things, and they will prosper. God has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein. And among the desert Arabs, men made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to God and His Messenger sat inactive. Soon a grievous penalty will seize the unbelievers among them."

Dwellers of the desert came that permission may be given to them and they sat (at home) who lied to God and His Messenger; a painful chastisement shall afflict those of them who disbelieved. There is no blame on those who are infirm, or ill, or who find no resources to spend (on the cause), if they are sincere (in duty) to God and His Messenger: no ground (of complaint) can there be against such as do right: and God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Not unto the weak nor unto the sick nor unto those who can find naught to spend is any fault (to be imputed though they stay at home) if they are true to God and His messenger. Not unto the good is there any road (of blame). God is Forgiving, Merciful. It shall be no crime in the weak, nor in the sick, nor in those who do not find what they should spend (to stay behind), so long as they are sincere to God and His Messenger; there is no way (to blame) against the doers of good; and God is Forgiving, Merciful. Nor (is there blame) on those who came to thee to be provided with mounts, and when thou saidst, "I can find no mounts for you," they turned back, their eyes streaming with tears of grief that they had no resources wherewith to provide the expenses. Nor unto those whom, when they came to thee (asking) that thou shouldst mount them, thou didst tell: I cannot find whereon to mount you. They turned back with eyes flowing with tears, for sorrow that they could not find the means to spend. Nor in those who when they came to you that you might carry them, you said: I cannot find that on which to carry you; they went back while their eyes overflowed with tears on account of grief for not finding that which they should spend. The ground (of complaint) is against such as claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with the (women) who remain behind: God hath sealed their hearts; so they know not (What they miss). The road (of blame) is only against those who ask for leave of thee (to stay at home) when they are rich. They are content to be with the useless. God hath sealed their hearts so that they know not. The way (to blame) is only against those who ask permission of you though they are rich; they have chosen to be with those who remained behind, and God has set a seal upon their hearts so they do not know. They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them. Say thou: "Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: God hath already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you: It is your actions that God and His Messenger will observe: in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knoweth what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did." They will make excuse to you (Muslims) when ye return unto them. Say: Make no excuse, for we shall not believe you. God hath told us tidings of you. God and His messenger will see your conduct, and then ye will be brought back unto Him Who knoweth the Invisible as well as the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do. They will excuse themselves to you when you go back to them. Say: Urge no excuse, by no means will we believe you; indeed God has informed us of matters relating to you; and now God and His Messenger will see your doings, then you shall be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you of what you did. They will swear to you by God, when ye return to them, that ye may leave them alone. So leave them alone: For they are an abomination, and Hell is their dwelling-place,-a fitting recompense for the (evil) that they did. They will swear by God unto you, when ye return unto them, that ye may let them be. Let them be, for lo! they are unclean, and their abode is hell as the reward for what they used to earn. They will swear to you by God when you return to them so that you may turn aside from them; so do turn aside from them; surely they are unclean and their abode is hell; a recompense for what they earned. They will swear unto you, that ye may be pleased with them but if ye are pleased with them, God is not pleased with those who disobey. They swear unto you, that ye may accept them. Though ye accept them. God verily accepteth not wrongdoing folk. They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them; but if you are pleased with them, yet surely God is not pleased with the transgressing people. The Arabs of the desert are the worst in Unbelief and hypocrisy, and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which God hath sent down to His Messenger: But God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. The wandering Arabs are more hard in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely to be ignorant of the limits which God hath revealed unto His messenger. And God is Knower, Wise. The dwellers of the desert are very hard in unbelief and hypocrisy, and more disposed not to know the limits of what God has revealed to His Messenger; and God is Knowing, Wise. Some of the desert Arabs look upon their payments as a fine, and watch for disasters for you: on them be the disaster of evil: for God is He That heareth and knoweth (all things). And of the wandering Arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth (for the cause of God) as a loss, and awaiteth (evil) turns of fortune for you (that he may be rid of it). The evil turn of fortune will be theirs. God is Hearer, Knower. And of the dwellers of the desert are those who take what they spend to be a fine, and they wait (the befalling of) calamities to you; on them (will be) the evil calamity; and God is Hearing, Knowing. But some of the desert Arabs believe in God and the Last Day, and look on their payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to God and obtaining the prayers of the Messenger. Aye, indeed they bring them nearer (to Him): soon will God admit them to His Mercy: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And of the wandering Arabs there is he who believeth in God and the Last Day, and taketh that which he expendeth and also the prayers of the messenger as acceptable offerings in the sight of God. Lo! verily it is an acceptable offering for them. God will bring them into His mercy. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. And of the dwellers of the desert are those who believe in God and the latter day and take what they spend to be (means of) the nearness of God and the Messenger's prayers; surely it shall be means of nearness for them; God will make them enter into His mercy; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. The vanguard (of Islam)- the first of those who forsook (their homes) and of those who gave them aid, and (also) those who follow them in (all) good deeds,- well-pleased is God with them, as are they with Him: for them hath He prepared gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever: that is the supreme felicity. And the first to lead the way, of the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who followed them in goodness - God is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him, and He hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the supreme triumph. And (as for) the foremost, the first of the Muhajirs and the Ansars, and those who followed them in goodness, God is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them for ever; that is the mighty achievement. Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites, as well as (desert Arabs) among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty. And among those around you of the wandering Arabs there are hypocrites, and among the townspeople of Al-Madinah (there are some who) persist in hypocrisy whom thou (O Muhammad) knowest not. We, We know them, and We shall chastise them twice; then they will be relegated to a painful doom. And from among those who are round about you of the dwellers of the desert there are hypocrites, and from among the people of Medina (also); they are stubborn in hypocrisy; you do not know them; We know them; We will chastise them twice then shall they be turned back to a grievous chastisement. Others (there are who) have acknowledged their wrong-doings: they have mixed an act that was good with another that was evil. Perhaps God will turn unto them (in Mercy): for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And (there are) others who have acknowledged their faults. They mixed a righteous action with another that was bad. It may be that God will relent toward them. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. And others have confessed their faults, they have mingled a good deed and an evil one; may be God will turn to them (mercifully); surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. Of their goods, take alms, that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them; and pray on their behalf. Verily thy prayers are a source of security for them: And God is One Who heareth and knoweth. Take alms of their wealth, wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst make them grow, and pray for them. Lo! thy prayer is an assuagement for them. God is Hearer, Knower. Take alms out of their property, you would cleanse them and purify them thereby, and pray for them; surely your prayer is a relief to them; and God is Hearing, Knowing. Know they not that God doth accept repentance from His votaries and receives their gifts of charity, and that God is verily He, the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful? Know they not that God is He Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen and taketh the alms, and that God is He Who is the Relenting, the Merciful. Do they not know that God accepts repentance from His servants and takes the alms, and that God is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful? And say: "Work (righteousness): Soon will God observe your work, and His Messenger, and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did." And say (unto them): Act! God will behold your actions, and (so will) His messenger and the believers, and ye will be brought back to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do. And say: Work; so God will see your work and (so will) His Messenger and the believers; and you shall be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you of what you did. There are (yet) others, held in suspense for the command of God, whether He will punish them, or turn in mercy to them: and God is All-Knowing, Wise.These are they who have lost their souls, and what they forged is gone from them. Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in the Hereafter! But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves before their Lord, they will be companions of the gardens, to dwell therein forever. These two kinds of men may be compared to the blind and deaf, and those who can see and hear well. Are they equal when compared? Will you not then take heed?

We sent Noah to his people with a mission: "I have come to you with a clear warning: That you serve none but God. Verily, I do fear for you the penalty of a grievous day." But the chiefs of the unbelievers among his people said: "We see in you nothing but a man like ourselves, nor do we see that any follow you but the meanest among us, in judgment immature. Nor do we see in you any merit above us; in fact, we think you are liars!"

He said: "O my people! See if I have a clear sign from my Lord, and that He has sent mercy unto me from His own presence, but that the mercy has been obscured from your sight. Shall we compel you to accept it when you are averse to it? And O my people! I ask you for no wealth in return; my reward is from none but God. But I will not drive away those who believe, for verily they are to meet their Lord, and you are the ignorant ones! And O my people! Who would help me against God if I drove them away? Will you not then take heed?"

"I tell you not that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know what is hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyes despise, that God will not grant them all that is good. God knows best what is in their souls; I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong-doer."

They said: "O Noah! You have disputed with us and prolonged the dispute with us. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you speak the truth!" He said: "Truly, God will bring it on you if He wills, and then you will not be able to frustrate it! Of no profit will be my counsel to you, much as I desire to give you good counsel, if it be that God wills to leave you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him will you return!"

Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "If I had forged it, on me were my sins, and I am free of the sins of which you are guilty!" It was revealed to Noah: "None of your people will believe except those who have already believed. So grieve no longer over their evil deeds. But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no further on behalf of those who are in sin, for they are about to be overwhelmed in the Flood."

Forthwith he started constructing the Ark. Every time that the chiefs of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said: "If you ridicule us now, we in our turn can look down on you with ridicule likewise! But soon you will know on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame, on whom will be unloosed a lasting penalty."

At length, behold! There came Our command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said: "Embark therein, of each kind two, male and female, and your family, except those against whom the word has already gone forth, and the believers." But only a few believed with him. So he said: "Embark on the Ark, in the name of God, whether it moves or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"

So the Ark floated with them on waves like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself from the rest: "O my son! Embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers!" The son replied: "I will betake myself to some mountain; it will save me from the water." Noah said: "This day nothing can save from the command of God, any but those on whom He has mercy!" And the waves came between them, and the son was among the drowned.hers who await God's decree, whether He will punish them or will forgive them. God is Knower, Wise. And others are made to await God's command, whether He chastise them or whether He turn to them mercifully, and God is Knowing, Wise.

And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity to disunite the Believers and in preparation for one who warred against God and His Messenger aforetime. They will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good; but God declares that they are certainly liars.

And as for those who chose a place of worship out of opposition and disbelief, and in order to cause dissent among the believers, and as an outpost for those who warred against God and His messenger aforetime, they will surely swear: We purposed naught save good. God bears witness that they are liars.

Never stand in it; certainly, a mosque founded on piety from the very first day is more deserving that you should stand in it; in it are men who love to be purified; and God loves those who purify themselves.

Is he who founded his building upon duty to God and His good pleasure better, or he who founded his building on the brink of a crumbling, overhanging precipice so that it toppled with him into the fire of hell? God does not guide wrongdoing folk.

The building which they have built will ever continue to be a source of disquiet in their hearts, except that their hearts get cut into pieces; and God is Knowing, Wise.

God has purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs in return is the garden of Paradise: they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'an. Who is more faithful to his covenant than God? Rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.

Those that turn to God in repentance; that serve Him, and praise Him; that wander in devotion to the cause of God; that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer; that enjoin good and forbid evil; and observe the limit set by God. These do rejoice. So proclaim the glad tidings to the Believers.

It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should pray for forgiveness for Pagans, even though they be of kin, after it is clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.

The prayer of Abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to God, he dissociated himself from him. Abraham was most tender-hearted, forbearing.

And God will not mislead a people after He has guided them, in order that He may make clear to them what to fear and avoid. God has knowledge of all things.

Unto God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and He takes it. Except for Him, you have no protector nor helper.

God turned with favor to the Prophet, the Muhajirs, and the Ansar, who followed him in a time of distress, after the hearts of a part of them had nearly swerved from duty. He turned to them also, for He is Most Kind, Most Merciful.

He turned in mercy also to the three who were left behind; they felt guilty to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them, for all its spaciousness, and their very souls seemed straitened to them. They perceived that there is no fleeing from God but to Himself. Then He turned to them, that they might repent. God is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

O you who believe! Fear God and be with those who are true in word and deed.

It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs of the neighborhood to refuse to follow God's Messenger, nor to prefer their own lives to his. Nothing could they suffer or do, but it was reckoned to their credit as a deed of righteousness, whether they suffered thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of God, or trod paths to raise the ire of the Unbelievers, or received any injury from an enemy. God does not let the reward of those who do good be lost.the dwellers of the desert to remain behind the Messenger of God, nor should they desire anything for themselves in preference to him; this is because they are not afflicted by thirst, fatigue, or hunger in God's way, nor do they tread a path which enrages the unbelievers, nor do they attain from the enemy what they attain, but a good work is written down to them on account of it; surely God does not waste the reward of the doers of good. Nor could they spend anything for the cause, small or great, nor cut across a valley, but the deed is inscribed to their credit: that God may requite their deed with the best possible reward. Nor should the Believers all go forth together: if a contingent from every expedition remained behind, they could devote themselves to studies in religion, and admonish the people when they return to them, that thus they may learn to guard themselves against evil. And the believers should not all go out to fight. Of every troop of them, a party only should go forth, that they who are left behind may gain sound knowledge in religion, and that they may warn their folk when they return to them, so that they may beware. And it does not beseem the believers that they should go forth all together; why should not then a company from every party from among them go forth that they may apply themselves to obtain understanding in religion, and that they may warn their people when they come back to them that they may be cautious? O you who believe! Fight the unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that God is with those who fear Him. Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find harshness in you, and know that God is with those who keep their duty unto Him. And whenever a surah is revealed, there are some of them who say: Which one of you has it strengthened in faith? Then as for those who believe, it strengthens them in faith and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it only adds wickedness to their wickedness, and they die while they are disbelievers. Do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every year, yet they do not turn to God nor do they mind. And whenever a surah is revealed, they look one at another as who should say: Does anybody see you? Then they turn away. God turns away their hearts because they are a people who do not understand. Now has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves: it grieves him that you should perish: ardently anxious is he over you: to the Believers he is most kind and merciful. But if they turn away, say: God suffices me: there is no god but He: on Him is my trust, He the Lord of the Throne Supreme!The son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood. He said: "I shall betake me to some mountain that will save me from the water." Noah said: "This day there is none that saveth from the commandment of God save him on whom He hath had mercy." And the wave came in between them, so he was among the drowned.

Then the word went forth: "O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky! Withhold thy rain!" and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: "Away with those who do wrong!"

And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: "O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the Justest of Judges!" He said: "O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou act like the ignorant!"

Noah said: "O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, lest I ask Thee for that of which I have no knowledge. And unless Thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, I should indeed be lost!"

The word came: "O Noah! Come down from the Ark with peace from Us, and blessing on thee and on some of the peoples who will spring from those with thee: but there will be other peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures for a time, but in the end will a grievous penalty reach them from Us."

Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which We have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the End is for those who are righteous.

To the 'Ad People, We sent Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! worship God! ye have no other god but Him. Your other gods are nothing but inventions!"

"O my people! I ask of you no reward for this Message. My reward is from none but Him who created me: Will ye not then understand?"

"And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance: He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain, and add strength to your strength: so turn ye not back in sin!"

They said: "O Hud! No Clear Sign hast thou brought us, and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee!"

"We say nothing but that perhaps some of our gods may have seized thee with imbecility." He said: "I call God to witness, and do ye bear witness, that I am free from the sin of ascribing partners to Him."

"Other gods as partners! So scheme your worst against me, all of you, and give me no respite."

"I put my trust in God, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He hath grasp of its forelock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on a straight Path."

"If ye turn away, I have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people to succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things."

So when Our decree issued, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by special Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe penalty.

Such were the 'Ad People: they rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher; disobeyed His messengers; and followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor.

And they were pursued by a Curse in this life, and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! Behold! for the 'Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed from sight were 'Ad the people of Hud!

To the Thamud People, We sent Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship God: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him in repentance: for my Lord is always near, ready to answer."

They said: "O Salih! thou hast been of us a center of our hopes hitherto! Dost thou now forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we are really in suspicious doubt as to that to which thou invitest us.""ustainer of the worlds!" Their prayer therein will be: Glory be to Thee, O God! and their greeting therein will be: Peace. And the conclusion of their prayer will be: Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds! If God were to hasten for men the ill they have earned as they would hasten on the good, then their respite would be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering in distraction. When trouble touches a man, he cries unto Us in all postures—lying down, sitting, or standing. But when We have solved his trouble, he passes on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! Thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes! Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they would not believe! Thus do We requite those who sin! Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how you would behave! But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them, those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us say: "Bring us a reading other than this, or change this." Say: "It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day to come." Say: "If God had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole lifetime before this have I tarried amongst you: will you not then understand?" Who does more wrong than such as forge a lie against God, or deny His Signs? But never will prosper those who sin. They serve, besides God, things that hurt them not nor profit them, and they say: "These are our intercessors with God." Say: "Do you indeed inform God of something He knows not, in the heavens or on earth? Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe to Him!" Mankind was but one nation, but differed later. Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord, their differences would have been settled between them. They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "The Unseen is only for God to know, then wait: I too will wait with you." When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity has touched them, behold! they take to plotting against Our Signs! Say: "Swifter to plan is God!" Verily, Our messengers record all the plots that you make! He it is Who enables you to traverse through land and sea; so that you even board ships—they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they rejoice thereat; then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are being overwhelmed: they cry unto God, sincerely offering their duty unto Him saying, "If You deliver us from this, we shall truly show our gratitude!" But when He delivers them, behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right! O mankind! your insolence is against your own souls—an enjoyment of the life of the present: in the end, to Us is your return, and We shall show you the truth of all that you did. The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth, which provides food for men and animals. It grows till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out in beauty: the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it. There reaches it Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before! Thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect."Thus do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect. But God calls to the Home of Peace and guides whom He pleases to a straight path. For those who do right is a goodly reward, and more. No darkness nor shame shall cover their faces; they are companions of the garden and will abide therein. But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil; ignominy will cover their faces. They will have no defender from God; their faces will be covered with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night. They are companions of the Fire and will abide therein.

One day We shall gather them all together and say to those who joined gods with Us: 'To your place! You and those you joined as partners.' We shall separate them, and their partners will say: 'It was not us that you worshipped!' God suffices as a witness between us and you; we were unaware of your worship. There every soul will prove the deeds it sent before; they will be brought back to God, their rightful Lord, and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch.

Say: 'Who sustains you from the sky and the earth? Who has power over hearing and sight? Who brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living? Who rules and regulates all affairs?' They will say, 'God.' Say, 'Will you not then show piety to Him?' Such is God, your real Cherisher and Sustainer. Apart from truth, what remains but error? How then are you turned away?

Thus is the word of your Lord proved true against those who rebel: they will not believe. Say: 'Of your partners, can any originate creation and repeat it?' Say: 'It is God who originates creation and repeats it. How then are you deluded away from the truth?' Say: 'Of your partners, is there any that can give guidance towards truth?' Say: 'It is God who gives guidance towards truth. Is He who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you? How do you judge?'

Most of them follow nothing but conjecture; truly conjecture can be of no avail against truth. Verily God is well aware of all that they do. This Qur'an is not such as can be produced by other than God; it is a confirmation of revelations that went before it and a fuller explanation of the Book, wherein there is no doubt, from the Lord of the worlds. Or do they say, 'He forged it'? Say: 'Bring then a Sura like unto it, and call anyone you can besides God, if you speak the truth.'

Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof has reached them. Thus did those before them make charges of falsehood; but see what was the end of those who did wrong. Of them, some believe therein, and some do not; and your Lord knows best those who are out for mischief. If they charge you with falsehood, say: 'My work to me, and yours to you. You are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what you do.'

Among them are some who pretend to listen to you, but can you make the deaf hear, even though they are without understanding? And among them are some who look at you, but can you guide the blind, even though they will not see? Verily God will not deal unjustly with man in aught; it is man that wrongs his own soul. One day He will gather them together; it will be as if they had tarried but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other. Assuredly, those will be the losers who denied the meeting with God and failed to follow His guidance."On the day when He shall gather them together, it will seem as though they had tarried but an hour of the day, recognizing one another. Those who denied the meeting with God and were not guided will perish. Whether We show you some part of what We promise them or take your soul before that, to Us is their return, and God is witness to all they do. Every nation had a messenger; when their messenger comes, the matter will be judged with justice, and they will not be wronged. They ask, "When will this promise come to pass if you speak the truth?" Say: "I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except as God wills. Every nation has an appointed term; when their term is reached, they cannot delay or advance it." They ask, "Is it true?" Say: "Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot escape." Every soul that has sinned would give all it possesses as ransom when it sees the penalty, but the judgment will be with justice, and no wrong will be done to them. To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth. God's promise is true, but most do not understand. He gives life and causes death, and to Him you shall be brought back. O mankind, there has come to you a direction from your Lord, a healing for the diseases in your hearts, and for those who believe, a guidance and mercy. Say: "In the bounty of God and His mercy, let them rejoice; it is better than what they hoard." Say: "See what God has sent down for sustenance, yet you hold some things forbidden and some lawful." Say: "Has God indeed permitted you, or do you invent things to attribute to God?" What will be the thought of those who invent lies against God on the Day of Judgment? God is full of bounty to mankind, but most are ungrateful. In whatever business you may be, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur'an, and whatever deed you may be doing, We are witnesses thereof. Nothing is hidden from your Lord, not even the weight of an atom. Verily, on the friends of God, there is no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who believe and guard against evil will have glad tidings in this life and the Hereafter. There is no changing the words of God; this is the supreme felicity. Let not their speech grieve you; all power and honor belong to God. He hears and knows all things. To God belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth. Those who worship partners besides God follow nothing but fancy and lies. He made the night for rest and the day to make things visible. Verily, in this are signs for those who listen.mong us hitherto as that wherein our hope was placed. Dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped? Lo! we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us. They said: O Salih! surely you were one amongst us in whom great expectations were placed before this; do you (now) forbid us from worshipping what our fathers worshipped? And as to that which you call us to, most surely we are in disquieting doubt.

He said: "O my people! do ye see? if I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against God if I were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my (portion) but perdition?" He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am (acting) on clear proof from my Lord and there hath come unto me a mercy from Him, who will save me from God if I disobey Him? Ye would add to me naught save perdition. He said: O my people! tell me if I have clear proof from my Lord and He has granted to me mercy from Himself who will then help me against God if I disobey Him? Therefore you do not add to me other than loss.

"And O my people! This she-camel of God is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on God's (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty will seize you!" O my people! This is the camel of God, a token unto you, so suffer her to feed in God's earth, and touch her not with harm lest a near torment seize you. And, O my people! this will be (as) God's she-camel for you, a sign; therefore leave her to pasture on God's earth and do not touch her with evil, for then a near chastisement will overtake you.

But they did ham-string her. So he said: "Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (Then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied!" But they hamstrung her, and then he said: Enjoy life in your dwelling-place three days! This is a threat that will not be belied. But they slew her, so he said: Enjoy yourselves in your abode for three days, that is a promise not to be belied.

When Our Decree issued, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord - He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will. So, when Our commandment came to pass, We saved Salih, and those who believed with him, by a mercy from Us, from the ignominy of that day. Lo, thy Lord! He is the Strong, the Mighty. So when Our decree came to pass, We delivered Salih and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and (We saved them) from the disgrace of that day; surely your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty.

The (mighty) Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning. And the (awful) Cry overtook those who did wrong, so that morning found them prostrate in their dwellings. And the rumbling overtook those who were unjust, so they became motionless bodies in their abodes.

As if they had never dwelt and flourished there. Ah! Behold! for the Thamud rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were the Thamud! As though they had not dwelt there. Lo! Thamud disbelieved in their Lord. A far removal for Thamud! As though they had never dwelt in them; now surely did Samood disbelieve in their Lord; now surely, away with Samood.

There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, "Peace!" He answered, "Peace!" and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf. And Our messengers came unto Abraham with good news. They said: Peace! He answered: Peace! and delayed not to bring a roasted calf. And certainly Our messengers came to Ibrahim with good news. They said: Peace. Peace, said he, and he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf.

But when he saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: "Fear not: We have been sent against the people of Lut." And when he saw their hands reached not to it, he mistrusted them and conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! Lo! we are sent unto the folk of Lot. But when he saw that their hands were not extended towards it, he deemed them strange and conceived fear of them. They said: Fear not, surely we are sent to Lut's people.

And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob. And his wife, standing by laughed when We gave her good tidings (of the birth) of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob. And his wife was standing (by), so she laughed, then We gave her the good news of Ishaq and after Ishaq of (a son's son) Yaqoub.

She said: "Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!" She said: Oh woe is me! Shall I bear a child when I am an old woman, and this my husband is an old man? Lo! this is a strange thing! She said: O wonder! shall I bear a son when I am an extremely old woman and this my husband an extremely old man? Most surely this is a wonderful thing.

They said: "Dost thou wonder at God's decree? The grace of God and His blessings on you, O ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory!" They said: Wonderest thou at the commandment of God? The mercy of God and His blessings be upon you, O people of the house! Lo! He is Owner of Praise, Owner of Glory! They said: Do you wonder at God's bidding? The mercy of God and His blessings are on you, O people of the house, surely He is Praised, Glorious.

When fear had passed from (the mind of) Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with us for Lut's people. And when the awe departed from Abraham, and the glad news reached him, he pleaded with Us on behalf of the folk of Lot. So when fear had gone away from Ibrahim and good news came to him, he began to plead with Us for Lut's people.

For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to look to God. Lo! Abraham was mild, imploring, penitent. Most surely Ibrahim was forbearing, tender-hearted, oft-returning (to God).

O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for them there cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back! (It was said) O Abraham! Forsake this! Lo! thy Lord's commandment hath gone forth, and lo! there cometh unto them a doom which cannot be repelled. O Ibrahim! leave off this, surely the decree of your Lord has come to pass, and surely there must come to them a chastisement that cannot be averted.

When Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: "This is a distressful day." And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was distressed and knew not how to protect them. He said: This is a distressful day. And when Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved for them, and he lacked strength to protect them, and said: This is a hard day.

And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations. He said: "O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear God, and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?" And his people came unto him, running towards him - and before then they used to commit abominations - He said: O my people! Here are my daughters! They are purer for you. Beware of God, and degrade me not in (the person of) my guests. Is there not among you any upright man? And his people came to him, (as if) rushed on towards him, and already they did evil deeds. He said: O my people! these are my daughters they are purer for you, so guard against (the punishment of) God and do not disgrace me with regard to my guests; is there not among you one right-minded man?

They said: "Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we want!" They said: Well thou knowest that we have no right to thy daughters, and well thou knowest what we want. They said: Certainly you know that we have no claim on your daughters, and most surely you know what we desire.

He said: "Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betake myself to some powerful support." He said: Would that I had strength to resist you or had some strong support (among you)! He said: Ah! that I had power to suppress you, rather I shall have recourse to a strong support.

(The Messengers) said: "O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife (will remain behind): To her will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Is not the morning nigh?" (The messengers) said: O Lot! Lo! we are messengers of thy Lord; they shall not reach thee. So travel with thy people in a part of the night, and let not one of you turn round - (all) save thy wife. Lo! that which smiteth them will smite her (also). Lo! their tryst is (for) the morning. Is not the morning nigh? They said: O Lut! we are the messengers of your Lord; they shall by no means reach you; so remove your followers in a part of the night and let none of you turn back except your wife, for surely whatsoever befalls them shall befall her; surely their appointed time is the morning; is not the morning nigh?

When Our Decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer. So when Our commandment came to pass We overthrew (that township) and rained upon it stones of clay, one after another. So when Our decree came to pass, We turned them upside down and rained down upon them stones, of what had been decreed, one after another.

Marked as from thy Lord: Nor are they ever far from those who do wrong! Marked with fire in the providence of thy Lord (for the destruction of the wicked). And they are never far from the wrong-doers. Marked (for punishment) with your Lord and it is not far off from the unjust.

To the Madyan People (We sent) Shu'aib, one of their own brethren: he said: "O my people! worship God: Ye have no other god but Him. And give not short measure or weight: I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will compass (you) all round." And unto Midian (We sent) their brother Shu'eyb. He said: O my people! Serve God. Ye have no other God save Him! And give not short measure and short weight. Lo! I see you well-to-do, and lo! I fear for you the doom of a besetting Day. And to Madyan (We sent) their brother SHe it is Who made for you the night that you might rest in it, and the day giving light; most surely there are signs in it for a people who would hear. They say: "God hath begotten a son!" - Glory be to Him! He is self-sufficient! His are all things in the heavens and on earth! No warrant have ye for this! Say ye about God what ye know not? They say: God hath taken a son - Glorified be He! He hath no needs! His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Ye have no warrant for this. Tell ye concerning God that which ye know not? They say: God has taken a son (to Himself)! Glory be to Him: He is the Self-sufficient: His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; you have no authority for this; do you say against God what you do not know? Say: "Those who invent a lie against God will never prosper." Say: Verily those who invent a lie concerning God will not succeed. Say: Those who forge a lie against God shall not be successful. A little enjoyment in this world!- and then, to Us will be their return, then shall We make them taste the severest penalty for their blasphemies. This world's portion (will be theirs), then unto Us is their return. Then We make them taste a dreadful doom because they used to disbelieve. (It is only) a provision in this world, then to Us shall be their return; then We shall make them taste severe punishment because they disbelieved. Relate to them the story of Noah. Behold! he said to his people: "O my people, if it be hard on your (mind) that I should stay (with you) and commemorate the signs of God,- yet I put my trust in God. Get ye then an agreement about your plan and among your partners, so your plan be on to you dark and dubious. Then pass your sentence on me, and give me no respite." Recite unto them the story of Noah, when he told his people: O my people! If my sojourn (here) and my reminding you by God's revelations are an offence unto you, in God have I put my trust, so decide upon your course of action you and your partners. Let not your course of action be in doubt for you. Then have at me, give me no respite. And recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his people: O my people! if my stay and my reminding (you) by the communications of God is hard on you yet on God do I rely then resolve upon your affair and (gather) your associates, then let not your affair remain dubious to you, then have it executed against me and give me no respite: "But if ye turn back, (consider): no reward have I asked of you: my reward is only due from God, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God's will (in Islam)." But if ye are averse I have asked of you no wage. My wage is the concern of God only, and I am commanded to be of those who surrender (unto Him). But if you turn back, I did not ask for any reward from you; my reward is only with God, and I am commanded that I should be of those who submit. They rejected Him, but We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We made them inherit (the earth), while We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our Signs. Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but heeded not)! But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and made them viceroys (in the earth), while We drowned those who denied Our revelations. See then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned. But they rejected him, so We delivered him and those with him in the ark, and We made them rulers and drowned those who rejected Our communications; see then what was the end of the (people) warned. Then after him We sent (many) messengers to their peoples: they brought them Clear Signs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors. Then, after him, We sent messengers unto their folk, and they brought them clear proofs. But they were not ready to believe in that which they before denied. Thus print We on the hearts of the transgressors. Then did We raise up after him messengers to their people, so they came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe in what they had rejected before; thus it is that We set seals upon the hearts of those who exceed the limits. Then after them sent We Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they were arrogant: they were a people in sin. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our revelations, but they were arrogant and were a guilty folk. Then did We send up after them Musa and Haroun to Firon and his chiefs with Our signs, but they showed pride and they were a guilty people. When the Truth did come to them from Us, they said: "This is indeed evident sorcery!" And when the Truth from Our presence came unto them, they said: Lo! this is mere magic. So when the truth came to them from Us they said: This is most surely clear enchantment! Said Moses: "Say ye (this) about the truth when it hath (actually) reached you? Is sorcery (like) this? But sorcerers will not prosper." Moses said: Speak ye (so) of the Truth when it hath come unto you? Is this magic? Now magicians thrive not. Musa said: Do you say (this) of the truth when it has come to you? Is it magic? And the magicians are not successful. They said: "Hast thou come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following,- in order that thou and thy brother may have greatness in the land? But not we shall believe in you!" They said: Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that (faith) in which we found our fathers, and that you two may own the place of greatness in the land? We will not believe you two. They said: Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers upon, and (that) greatness in the land should be for you two? And we are not going to believe in you. Said Pharaoh: "Bring me every sorcerer well versed." And Pharaoh said: Bring every cunning wizard unto me. And Firon said: Bring to me every skillful magician. When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: "Throw ye what ye (wish) to throw!" And when the wizards came, Moses said unto them: Cast your cast! And when the magicians came, Musa said to them: Cast down what you have to cast. When they had had their throw, Moses said: "What ye have brought is sorcery: God will surely make it of no effect: for God prospereth not the work of those who make mischief." And when they had cast, Moses said: That which ye have brought is magic. Lo! God will make it vain. Lo! God upholdeth not the work of mischief-makers. So when they cast down, Musa said to them: What you have brought is deception; surely God will make it naught; surely God does not make the work of mischief-makers to thrive. "And God by His words doth prove and establish His truth, however much the sinners may hate it!" And God will vindicate the Truth by His words, however much the guilty be averse. And God will show the truth to be the truth by His words, though the guilty may be averse (to it). But none believed in Moses except some children of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharaoh was mighty on the earth and one who transgressed all bounds. But none trusted Moses, save some scions of his people, (and they were) in fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs, that he would persecute them. Lo! Pharaoh was verily a tyrant in the land, and lo! he verily was of the wanton. But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, on account of the fear of Firon and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them; and most surely Firon was lofty in the land; and most surely he was of the extravagant. Moses said: "O my people! If ye do (really) believe in God, then in Him put your trust if ye submit (your will to His)." And Moses said: O my people! If ye have believed in God then put trust in Him, if ye have indeed surrendered (unto Him)! And Musa said: O my people! if you believe in God, then rely on Him (alone) if you submit (to God). They said: "In God do we put out trust. Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who practise oppression;" They said: In God we put trust. Our Lord! Oh, make us not a lure for the wrongdoing folk; So they said: On God we rely: O our Lord! make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people: "And deliver us by Thy Mercy from those who reject (Thee)." And, of Thy mercy, save us from the folk that disbelieve. And do Thou deliver us by Thy mercy from the unbelieving people. We inspired Moses and his brother with this Message: "Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, make your dwellings into places of worship, and establish regular prayers: and give glad tidings to those who believe!" And We inspired Moses and his brother, (saying): Appoint houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses oratories, and establish worship. And give good news to the believers. And We revealed to Musa and his brother, saying: Take for your people houses to abide in Egypt and make your houses places of worship and keep up prayer and give good news to the believers. Moses prayed: "Our Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of the present, and so, Our Lord, they mislead (men) from Thy Path. Deface our Lord, the features of their wealth, and send hardness to their hearts, so they will not believe until they see the grievous penalty." And Moses said: Our Lord! Lo! Thou hast given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and riches in the life of the world, Our Lord! that they may lead men astray from Thy way. Our Lord! Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not till they see the painful doom. And Musa said: Our Lord! surely Thou hast given to Firon and his chiefs finery and riches in this world's life, to this end, our Lord, that they lead (people) astray from Thy way: Our Lord! destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not until they see the painful punishment. God said: "Accepted is your prayer (O Moses and Aaron)! So stand ye straight, and follow not the path of those who know not." He said: Your prayer is heard. Do ye twain keep to the straight path, and follow not the road of those who have no knowledge. He said: The prayer of you both has indeed been accepted, therefore continue in the right way and do not follow the path of those who do not know. We took the Children of Israel across the sea: Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite. At length, when over"We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts pursued them in rebellion and transgression. When drowning overtook him, he exclaimed: 'I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in, and I am of those who submit.' (It was said to him): 'Ah now! But a little while before, you were in rebellion and did mischief!' 'This day We shall save you in your body, that you may be a sign to those who come after you. But many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!' We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place and provided for them sustenance of the best. They fell into schisms after knowledge had been granted to them. God will judge between them as to the schisms amongst them on the Day of Judgment. If you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Book from before you. The Truth has indeed come to you from your Lord, so be not of those in doubt. Nor be of those who reject the signs of God, or you shall be of those who perish. Those against whom the word of your Lord has been verified would not believe, even if every Sign was brought to them, until they see the penalty grievous. Why was there not a single township (among those We warned) which believed, so its faith should have profited it, except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the penalty of ignominy in the life of the present and permitted them to enjoy their life for a while. If it had been your Lord's will, they would all have believed, all who are on earth! Will you then compel mankind, against their will, to believe? No soul can believe except by the will of God, and He will place doubt on those who will not understand. Say: 'Behold all that is in the heavens and on earth.' But neither Signs nor Warners profit those who believe not. Do they then expect anything but what happened in the days of the men who passed away before them? Say: 'Wait then, for I too will wait with you.' In the end, We deliver Our messengers and those who believe. Thus it is fitting on Our part that We should deliver those who believe. Say: 'O mankind! If you are in doubt as to my religion, then know that I worship not those whom you worship instead of God, but I worship God Who causes you to die, and I am commanded to be of the believers.' 'Set your face towards religion with true piety, and never be of the Unbelievers.' 'Nor call on any, other than God; such will neither profit you nor hurt you. If you do, you shall certainly be of those who do wrong.' If God touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He. If He designs some benefit for you, there is none who can keep back His favor. He causes it to reach whomsoever of His servants He pleases. He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: 'O mankind! Now the Truth has reached you from your Lord. Those who receive guidance do so for the good of their own souls. Those who stray do so to their own loss. I am not set over you to arrange your affairs.' Follow the inspiration sent to you and be patient and constant until God decides, for He is the best to decide."hu'aib. He said: O my people! serve God, you have no god other than He, and do not give short measure and weight: surely I see you in prosperity and surely I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing day. 

"And O my people! give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due: commit not evil in the land with intent to do mischief." 

O my people! Give full measure and full weight in justice, and wrong not people in respect of their goods. And do not evil in the earth, causing corruption. 

And, O my people! give full measure and weight fairly, and defraud not men their things, and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief:

"That which is left you by God is best for you, if ye (but) believed! but I am not set over you to keep watch!" 

That which God leaveth with you is better for you if ye are believers; and I am not a keeper over you. 

What remains with God is better for you if you are believers, and I am not a keeper over you.

They said: "O Shu'aib! Does thy (religion of) prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doing what we like with our property? truly, thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded!" 

They said: O Shu'eyb! Doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should forsake that which our fathers (used to) worship, or that we (should leave off) doing what we will with our own property. Lo! thou art the mild, the guide to right behaviour. 

They said: O Shu'aib! does your prayer enjoin you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property? Forsooth you are the forbearing, the right-directing one.

He said: "O my people! see ye whether I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord, and He hath given me sustenance (pure and) good as from Himself? I wish not, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from God. In Him I trust, and unto Him I look." 

He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am (acting) on a clear proof from my Lord and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him (how can I concede aught to you)? I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do. I desire naught save reform so far as I am able. My welfare is only in God. In Him I trust and unto Him I turn (repentant). 

He said: O my people! have you considered if I have a clear proof from my Lord and He has given me a goodly sustenance from Himself, and I do not desire that in opposition to you I should betake myself to that which I forbid you: I desire nothing but reform so far as I am able, and with none but God is the direction of my affair to a right issue; on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn:

"And O my people! let not my dissent (from you) cause you to sin, lest ye suffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hud or of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you!" 

And, O my people! Let not the schism with me cause you to sin so that there befall you that which befell the folk of Noah and the folk of Hud, and the folk of Salih; and the folk of Lot are not far off from you. 

And, O my people! let not opposition to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of what befell the people of Nuh, or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you;

"But ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him (in repentance): For my Lord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness." 

Ask pardon of your Lord and then turn unto Him (repentant). Lo! my Lord is Merciful, Loving. 

And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; surely my Lord is Merciful, Loving-kind.

They said: "O Shu'aib! much of what thou sayest we do not understand! In fact among us we see that thou hast no strength! Were it not for thy family, we should certainly have stoned thee! for thou hast among us no great position!" 

They said: O Shu'eyb! We understand not much of that thou tellest, and lo! we do behold thee weak among us. But for thy family, we should have stoned thee, for thou art not strong against us. 

They said: O Shu'aib! we do not understand much of what you say and most surely we see you to be weak among us, and were it not for your family we would surely stone you, and you are not mighty against us.

He said: "O my people! is then my family of more consideration with you than God? For ye cast Him away behind your backs (with contempt). But verily my Lord encompasseth on all sides all that ye do!" 

He said: O my people! Is my family more to be honoured by you than God? and ye put Him behind you, neglected! Lo! my Lord surroundeth what ye do. 

He said: O my people! is my family more esteemed by you than God? And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your back; surely my Lord encompasses what you do:

"And O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): Soon will ye know who it is on whom descends the penalty of ignominy; and who is a liar! and watch ye! for I too am watching with you!" 

And, O my people! Act according to your power, lo! I (too) am acting. Ye will soon know on whom there cometh a doom that will abase him, and who it is that lieth. And watch! Lo! I am a watcher with you. 

And, O my people! act according to your ability, I too am acting; you will come to know soon who it is on whom will light the punishment that will disgrace him and who it is that is a liar, and watch, surely I too am watching with you.

When Our decree issued, We saved Shu'aib and those who believed with him, by (special) mercy from Ourselves: But the (mighty) blast did seize the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,-

And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Shu'eyb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the (Awful) Cry seized those who did injustice, and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings,

And when Our decree came to pass We delivered Shu'aib, and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless bodies in their abodes,

As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! Ah! Behold! How the Madyan were removed (from sight) as were removed the Thamud!

As though they had not dwelt there. A far removal for Midian, even as Thamud had been removed afar!

As though they had never dwelt in them; now surely perdition overtook Madyan as had perished Samood.

And we sent Moses, with Our Clear (Signs) and an authority manifest,

And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant

And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and a clear authority,

Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: but they followed the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was no right (guide).

Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they did follow the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was no right guide.

To Firon and his chiefs, but they followed the bidding of Firon, and Firon's bidding was not right-directing.

He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment, and lead them into the Fire (as cattle are led to water): But woeful indeed will be the place to which they are led!

He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will lead them to the Fire for watering-place. Ah, hapless is the watering-place (whither they are) led.

He shall lead his people on the resurrection day, and bring them down to the fire; and evil the place to which they are brought.

And they are followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Judgment: and woeful is the gift which shall be given (unto them)!

A curse is made to follow them in the world and on the Day of Resurrection. Hapless is the gift (that will be) given (them).

And they are overtaken by curse in this (world), and on the resurrection day, evil the gift which shall be given.

These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee: of them some are standing, and some have been mown down (by the sickle of time).

That is (something) of the tidings of the townships (which were destroyed of old). We relate it unto thee (Muhammad). Some of them are standing and some (already) reaped.

This is an account of (the fate of) the towns which We relate to you; of them are some that stand and (others) mown down.

It was not We that wronged them: They wronged their own souls: the deities, other than God, whom they invoked, profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord: Nor did they add aught (to their lot) but perdition!

We wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves; and their gods on whom they call beside God availed them naught when came thy Lord's command; they added to them naught save ruin.

And We did not do them injustice, but they were unjust to themselves, so their gods whom they called upon besides God did not avail them aught when the decree of your Lord came to pass; and they added but to their ruin.

Such is the chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in the midst of their wrong: grievous, indeed, and severe is His chastisement.

Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while they are doing wrong. Lo! His grasp is painful, very strong.

And such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are unjust; surely His punishment is painful, severe.

In that is a Sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter: that is a Day for which mankind will be gathered together: that will be a Day of Testimony.

Lo! herein verily there is a portent for those who fear the doom of the Hereafter. That is a day unto which mankind will be gathered, and that is a day that will be witnessed.

Most surely there is a sign in this for him who fears the chastisement of the hereafter; this is a day on which the people shall be gathered together and this is a day that shall be witnessed.

Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed.

And We defer it only to a term already reckoned.

And We do not delay it but to an appointed term.

The day it arrives, no soul shall speak except by His leave: of those (gathered) some will be wretched and some will be blessed.

On the day when it cometh no soul will speak except by His permission; some among them will be wretched, (others) glad.

On the day when it shall come, no soul shall speak except with His permission, then (some) of them shall be unhappy and (others) happy.

Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing but) the heaving of sighs and sobs:

As for those who will be wretched (on that day) they will bee in the Fire; sighing and wailing will be their portion therein. So as to those who are unhappy, they shall be in the fire; for them shall be sighing and groaning in it:

They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord wills: for thy Lord is the accomplisher of what He plans. Abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure, save for that which thy Lord wills. Lo! thy Lord is Doer of what He will.

And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord wills: a gift without break. And as for those who will be glad (that day) they will be in the Garden, abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord wills: a gift unfailing.

Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before them: but verily We shall pay them back in full their portion without the least abatement. So be not thou in doubt concerning that which these folk worship. They worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime. Lo! we shall pay them their whole due unabated.

We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose therein: had it not been that a word had gone forth before from thy Lord, the matter would have been decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it. And we verily gave unto Moses the Scripture, and there was strife thereupon; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, the case would have been judged between them, and lo! they are in grave doubt concerning it.

And, of a surety, to all will your Lord pay back in full the recompense of their deeds: for He knows well all that they do. And lo! unto each thy Lord will verily repay his works in full. Lo! He is Informed of what they do.

Therefore stand firm in the straight Path as thou art commanded, thou and those who with thee turn unto God; and transgress not from the Path: for He sees well all that ye do. So tread thou the straight path as thou art commanded, and those who turn unto God with thee, and transgress not. Lo! He is Seer of what ye do.

And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than God, nor shall ye be helped. And incline not toward those who do wrong lest the Fire touch you, and ye have no protecting friends against God, and afterward ye would not be helped.

And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: For those things, that are good remove those that are evil: Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember their Lord. Establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the night. Lo! good deeds annul ill-deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful.

And be steadfast in patience; for verily God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish. And have patience, for lo! God does not waste the reward of the good-doers.

Why were there not, among the generations before you, persons possessed of balanced good sense, prohibiting men from mischief in the earth - except a few among them whom We saved from harm? But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoyment of the good things of life which were given them, and persisted in sin. If only there had been among the generations before you men possessing a remnant of good sense to warn their people from corruption in the earth, as did a few of those whom We saved from them! The wrong-doers followed that by which they were made sapless, and were guilty.

Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrong-doing, if its members were likely to mend. In truth thy Lord destroyed not the townships tyrannously while their folk were doing right.

If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one people: but they will not cease to dispute. And if thy Lord had willed, He verily would have made mankind one nation, yet they cease not differing.

Except those on whom thy Lord has bestowed His Mercy: and for this did He create them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: "I will fill Hell with jinns and men all together." Save him on whom thy Lord has mercy; and for that He did create them. And the Word of thy Lord has been fulfilled: Verily I shall fill hell with the jinn and mankind together.

All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers, with it We make firm thy heart: in them there comes to thee the Truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe. And all that We relate unto thee of the story of the messengers is in order that thereby We may make firm thy heart. And herein has come unto thee the Truth and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.

Say to those who do not believe: "Do whatever ye can: We shall do our part;" And say unto those who believe not: Act according to your power. Lo! We too are acting.

"And wait ye! We too shall wait." And wait! Lo! We too are waiting.

To God do belong the unseen secrets of the heavens and the earth, and to Him goes back every affair for decision: then worship Him, and put thy trust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do. And God's is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth, and unto Him the whole matter will be returned. So worship Him and put thy trust in Him. Lo! thy Lord is not unaware of what ye mortals do.God; surely I am a warner for you from Him and a giver of good news. Seek the forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance; that He may grant you enjoyment, good and true, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace on all who abound in merit. But if you turn away, then I fear for you the penalty of a great day. Ask pardon of your Lord and turn to Him repentant. He will cause you to enjoy a fair estate until a time appointed. He gives His bounty unto every bountiful one. But if you turn away, then I fear for you the retribution of an awful Day. To God is your return, and He has power over all things. Behold! They fold up their hearts, that they may lie hid from Him! Even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal: for He knows well the inmost secrets of the hearts. There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance depends on God: He knows the time and place of its definite abode and its temporary deposit: All is in a clear Record. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. But if you say to them, "You shall indeed be raised up after death," the Unbelievers would say, "This is nothing but obvious sorcery!" If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, "What keeps it back?" On the day it actually reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at! If We give man a taste of Mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold! he is in despair and falls into blasphemy. But if We give him a taste of Our favors after adversity has touched him, he is sure to say, "All evil has departed from me:" Behold! he falls into exultation and pride. Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness; for them is forgiveness of sins and a great reward. Perchance you may feel the inclination to give up a part of what is revealed unto you, and your heart feels straitened lest they say, "Why is not a treasure sent down unto him, or why does not an angel come down with him?" But you are there only to warn! It is God that arranges all affairs! Or they may say, "He forged it," Say, "Bring then ten suras forged, like unto it, and call to your aid whomsoever you can, other than God! If you speak the truth!" If then they answer not your call, know that this revelation is sent down replete with the knowledge of God, and that there is no god but He! Will you even then submit to Islam? Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter, to them We shall pay the price of their deeds therein, without diminution. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: vain are the designs they frame therein, and of no effect are the deeds that they do! Can they be like those who accept a Clear Sign from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself teaches, as did the Book of Moses before it, a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from your Lord: yet many among men do not believe! Who does more wrong than those who invent a lie against God? They will be turned back to the presence of their Lord, and the witnesses will say, "These are the ones who lied against their Lord! Behold! the Curse of God is on those who do wrong!" Those who would hinder men from the path of God and would seek in it something crooked: these were they who denied the Hereafter! They will in no wise frustrate His design on earth, nor have they protectors besides God! Their penalty will be doubled! They lost the power to hear, and they did not see! They are the ones who have lost their own souls: and the fancies they invented have left them in the lurch!the children of Yaqoub, as He made it complete before to your fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq; surely your Lord is Knowing, Wise.

Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs for seekers after Truth.

They said: "Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we: But we are a goodly body! Really our father is obviously wandering in his mind!"

When they said: Verily Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, many though we be. Lo! our father is in plain aberration.

"Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some unknown land, that so the favour of your father may be given to you alone: (there will be time enough) for you to be righteous after that!"

One said: Kill Joseph or cast him to some other land, so that your father's favour may be all for you, and ye may afterward be righteous folk.

A speaker from among them said: Do not slay Yusuf, and cast him down into the bottom of the pit if you must do it, so that some of the travellers may pick him up.

They said: "O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph, seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?"

They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, when lo! we are good friends to him?

They said: O our father! what reason have you that you do not trust in us with respect to Yusuf? And most surely we are his sincere well-wishers:

"Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him."

Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play. And lo! we shall take good care of him.

Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and sport, and surely we will guard him well.

(Jacob) said: "Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him."

He said: Lo! in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you, and I fear lest the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him.

He said: Surely it grieves me that you should take him off, and I fear lest the wolf devour him while you are heedless of him.

They said: "If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we indeed (first) have perished ourselves!"

They said: If the wolf should devour him when we are (so strong) a band, then surely we should have already perished.

They said: Surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are a (strong) company, we should then certainly be losers.

So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): 'Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they know (thee) not'

Then, when they led him off, and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit, We inspired in him: Thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know (thee) not.

So when they had gone off with him and agreed that they should put him down at the bottom of the pit, and We revealed to him: You will most certainly inform them of this their affair while they do not perceive.

Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping.

And they came weeping to their father in the evening.

And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping.

They said: "O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things; and the wolf devoured him. But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth."

Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying even when we speak the truth.

They said: O our father! surely we went off racing and left Yusuf by our goods, so the wolf devoured him, and you will not believe us though we are truthful.

They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: "Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is God (alone) Whose help can be sought."

And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience. And God it is Whose help is to be sought in that (predicament) which ye describe.

And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. He said: Nay, your souls have made the matter light for you, but patience is good and God is He Whose help is sought for against what you describe.

Then there came a caravan of travellers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well). He said: "Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man!" So they concealed him as a treasure! But God knoweth well all that they do!

And there came a caravan, and they sent their water-drawer. He let down his pail (into the pit). He said: Good luck! Here is a youth. And they hid him as a treasure, and God was Aware of what they did.

And there came travellers and they sent their water-drawer and he let down his bucket. He said: O good news! this is a youth; and they concealed him as an article of merchandise, and God knew what they did.

The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him!

And they sold him for a low price, a number of silver coins; and they attached no value to him.

And they sold him for a small price, a few pieces of silver, and they showed no desire for him.

The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: "Make his stay (among us) honourable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And God hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not.

And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife: Receive him honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son. Thus we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And God was predominant in His career, but most of mankind know not.

And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife: Give him an honorable abode, maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And thus did We establish Yusuf in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings; and God is the master of His affair, but most people do not know.

When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right.

And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward the good.

And when he had attained his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge: and thus do We reward those who do good.

But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: "Now come, thou (dear one)!" He said: "God forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!"

And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the doors and said: Come! He said: I seek refuge in God! Lo! he is my lord, who hath treated me honourably. Lo! wrong-doers never prosper.

And she in whose house he was sought to make himself yield (to her), and she made fast the doors and said: Come forward. He said: I seek God's refuge, surely my Lord made good my abode: Surely the unjust do not prosper.

And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified.

She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness. Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves.

And certainly she made for him, and he would have made for her, were it not that he had seen the manifest evidence of his Lord; thus (it was) that We might turn away from him evil and indecency, surely he was one of Our sincere servants.

So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door. She said: "What is the (fitting) punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or a grievous chastisement?"

And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they met her lord and master at the door. She said: What shall be his reward, who wisheth evil to thy folk, save prison or a painful doom?

And they both hastened to the door, and she rent his shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door. She said: What is the punishment of him who intends evil to your wife except imprisonment or a painful chastisement?

He said: "It was she that sought to seduce me - from my (true) self." And one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus): "If it be that his shirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar!"

(Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act. And a witness of her own folk testified: If his shirt is torn from before, then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars.

He said: She sought to make me yield (to her); and a witness of her own family bore witness: If his shirt is rent from front, she speaks the truth and he is one of the liars:

"But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the liar, and he is telling the truth!"

And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the truthful.

And if his shirt is rent from behind, she tells a lie and he is one of the truthful.

So when he saw his shirt,- that it was torn at the back,- (her husband) said: "Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly, mighty is your snare!"These are they who have lost their souls, and what they forged is gone from them. Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in the Hereafter! But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves before their Lord, they will be companions of the gardens, to dwell therein forever! These two kinds of men may be compared to the blind and deaf, and those who can see and hear well. Are they equal when compared? Will you not then take heed? We sent Noah to his people with a mission: "I have come to you with a Clear Warning: That you serve none but God. Verily I do fear for you the penalty of a grievous day." But the chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: "We see in you nothing but a man like ourselves, nor do we see that any follow you but the meanest among us, in judgment immature. Nor do we see in you any merit above us; in fact, we think you are liars!" He said: "O my people! See if I have a Clear Sign from my Lord, and that He has sent Mercy unto me from His own presence, but that the Mercy has been obscured from your sight? Shall we compel you to accept it when you are averse to it? And O my people! I ask you for no wealth in return: my reward is from none but God. But I will not drive away those who believe, for verily they are to meet their Lord, and you I see are the ignorant ones! And O my people! Who would help me against God if I drove them away? Will you not then take heed? I tell you not that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know what is hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyes despise, that God will not grant them all that is good: God knows best what is in their souls. I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong-doer." They said: "O Noah! You have disputed with us, and much have you prolonged the dispute with us. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you speak the truth!" He said: "Truly, God will bring it on you if He wills, and then you will not be able to frustrate it! Of no profit will be my counsel to you, much as I desire to give you good counsel, if it be that God wills to leave you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him will you return!" Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "If I had forged it, on me were my sins, and I am free of the sins of which you are guilty!" It was revealed to Noah: "None of your people will believe except those who have believed already. So grieve no longer over their evil deeds. But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no further on behalf of those who are in sin, for they are about to be overwhelmed in the Flood." Forthwith he started constructing the Ark. Every time that the chiefs of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said: "If you ridicule us now, we in our turn can look down on you with ridicule likewise! But soon will you know on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame, on whom will be unloosed a lasting penalty." At length, behold! There came Our command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said: "Embark therein, of each kind two, male and female, and your family, except those against whom the word has already gone forth, and the Believers." But only a few believed with him. So he said: "Embark on the Ark, in the name of God, whether it moves or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!" So the Ark floated with them on the waves towering like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself from the rest: "O my son! Embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers!" The son replied: "I will betake myself to some mountain; it will save me from the water." Noah said: "This day nothing can save from the command of God, any but those on whom He has mercy!" And the waves came between them, and the son was among the drowned.The son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood. He said: "I shall betake me to some mountain that will save me from the water." Noah said: "This day there is none that saveth from the commandment of God save him on whom He hath had mercy." And the wave came in between them, so he was among the drowned.

Then the word went forth: "O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky! Withhold thy rain!" and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: "Away with those who do wrong!"

And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: "O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the Justest of Judges!" He said: "O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou act like the ignorant!"

Noah said: "O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, lest I ask Thee for that of which I have no knowledge. And unless Thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, I should indeed be lost!" The word came: "O Noah! Come down from the Ark with peace from Us, and blessing on thee and on some of the peoples who will spring from those with thee: but there will be other peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures for a time, but in the end will a grievous penalty reach them from Us."

Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which We have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the End is for those who are righteous.

To the 'Ad People (We sent) Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! worship God! ye have no other god but Him. (Your other gods) ye do nothing but invent!" They said: "O Hud! No Clear Sign that hast thou brought us, and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee!"

He said: "I call God to witness, and do ye bear witness, that I am free from the sin of ascribing partners to Him. So scheme your worst against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in God, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He hath grasp of its forelock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on a straight Path."

"If ye turn away, I have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people to succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things."

So when Our decree issued, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by special Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe penalty. Such were the 'Ad People: they rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher; disobeyed His messengers; and followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor. And they were pursued by a Curse in this life, and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! Behold! for the 'Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed from sight were 'Ad the people of Hud!

To the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship God: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him in repentance: for my Lord is always near, ready to answer."

They said: "O Salih! thou hast been of us! a centre of our hopes hitherto! dost thou now forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we are really in suspicious doubt as to that to which thou invitest us."mong us hitherto as that wherein our hope was placed. Dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped? Lo! we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us. 

He said: "O my people! do ye see? if I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against God if I were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my (portion) but perdition?"

"And O my people! This she-camel of God is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on God's (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty will seize you!"

But they did ham-string her. So he said: "Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (Then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied!"

When Our Decree issued, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord - He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will.

The (mighty) Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning,-

As if they had never dwelt and flourished there. Ah! Behold! for the Thamud rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were the Thamud!

There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, "Peace!" He answered, "Peace!" and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.

But when he saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: "Fear not: We have been sent against the people of Lut."

And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob.

She said: "Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!"

They said: "Dost thou wonder at God's decree? The grace of God and His blessings on you, O ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory!"

When fear had passed from (the mind of) Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with us for Lut's people.

For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to look to God.

"O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for them there cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back!"

When Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: "This is a distressful day."

And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations. He said: "O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear God, and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?"

They said: "Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we want!"

He said: "Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betake myself to some powerful support."

(The Messengers) said: "O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife (will remain behind): To her will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Is not the morning nigh?"

When Our Decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-

Marked as from thy Lord: Nor are they ever far from those who do wrong!

To the Madyan People (We sent) Shu'aib, one of their own brethren: he said: "O my people! worship God: Ye have no other god but Him. And give not short measure or weight: I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will compass (you) all round.""This is of the guile of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great." So when he saw his shirt rent from behind, he said: "Surely it is a guile of you women; surely your guile is great."

"O Joseph, pass this over! (O wife), ask forgiveness for thy sin, for truly thou hast been at fault!" 

"O Joseph! Turn away from this, and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for thy sin. Lo! thou art of the faulty."

"O Yusuf! turn aside from this; and (O my wife)! ask forgiveness for your fault, surely you are one of the wrong-doers."

Ladies said in the City: "The wife of the (great) 'Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his (true) self: Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: we see she is evidently going astray."

And women in the city said: "The ruler's wife is asking of her slave-boy an ill-deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain aberration."

And women in the city said: "The chief's wife seeks her slave to yield himself (to her), surely he has affected her deeply with (his) love; most surely we see her in manifest error."

When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said (to Joseph), "Come out before them." When they saw him, they did extol him, and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said, "God preserve us! no mortal is this! this is none other than a noble angel!"

And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them a cushioned couch (to lie on at the feast) and gave to every one of them a knife and said (to Joseph): "Come out unto them!" And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, exclaiming: "God Blameless! This is no human being. This is not other than some gracious angel."

So when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them and prepared for them a repast, and gave each of them a knife, and said (to Yusuf): "Come forth to them." So when they saw him, they deemed him great, and cut their hands (in amazement), and said: "Remote is God (from imperfection); this is not a mortal; this is but a noble angel."

She said: "There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I did seek to seduce him from his (true) self but he did firmly save himself guiltless! And now, if he doth not my bidding, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and (what is more) be of the company of the vilest!"

She said: "This is he on whose account ye blamed me. I asked of him an evil act, but he proved continent, but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low."

She said: "This is he with respect to whom you blamed me, and certainly I sought his yielding himself (to me), but he abstained, and if he does not do what I bid him, he shall certainly be imprisoned, and he shall certainly be of those who are in a state of ignominy."

He said: "O my Lord! the prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me: Unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I should (in my youthful folly) feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant."

He said: "O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me, and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish."

He said: "My Lord! the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they invite me; and if Thou turn not away their device from me, I will yearn towards them and become (one) of the ignorant."

So his Lord hearkened to him (in his prayer), and turned away from him their snare: Verily He heareth and knoweth (all things).

So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is Hearer, Knower.

Thereupon his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their guile from him; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

Then it occurred to the men, after they had seen the signs, (that it was best) to imprison him for a time.

And it seemed good to them (the men-folk) after they had seen the signs (of his innocence) to imprison him for a time.

Then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him till a time.

Now with him there came into the prison two young men. Said one of them: "I see myself (in a dream) pressing wine." said the other: "I see myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating, thereof." "Tell us" (they said) "The truth and meaning thereof: for we see thou art one that doth good (to all)."

And two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: "I dreamed that I was pressing wine." The other said: "I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Announce unto us the interpretation, for we see thee of those good (at interpretation)."

And two youths entered the prison with him. One of them said: "I saw myself pressing wine." And the other said: "I saw myself carrying bread on my head, of which birds ate. Inform us of its interpretation; surely we see you to be of the doers of good."

He said: "Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me. I have (I assure you) abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in God and that (even) deny the Hereafter."

He said: "The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in God and are disbelievers in the Hereafter."

He said: "There shall not come to you the food with which you are fed, but I will inform you both of its interpretation before it comes to you; this is of what my Lord has taught me; surely I have forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in God, and they are deniers of the hereafter."

"And I follow the ways of my fathers,- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and never could we attribute any partners whatever to God: that (comes) of the grace of God to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful."

"And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to God. This is of the bounty of God unto us (the seed of Abraham) and unto mankind; but most men give not thanks."

"And I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub; it beseems us not that we should associate aught with God; this is by God's grace upon us and on mankind, but most people do not give thanks."

"O my two companions of the prison! (I ask you): are many lords differing among themselves better, or the One God, Supreme and Irresistible?"

"O my fellow-prisoners! Are divers lords better, or God the One, Almighty?"

"O my two mates of the prison! are sundry lords better or God the One, the Supreme?"

"If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and your fathers,- for which God hath sent down no authority: the command is for none but God: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men understand not."

"Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. God hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with God only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the right religion, but most men know not."

"You do not serve besides Him but names which you have named, you and your fathers; God has not sent down any authority for them; judgment is only God's; He has commanded that you shall not serve aught but Him; this is the right religion but most people do not know."

"O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head. (So) hath been decreed that matter whereof ye twain do enquire."

"O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire."

"O my two mates of the prison! as for one of you, he shall give his lord to drink wine; and as for the other, he shall be crucified, so that the birds shall eat from his head, the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired."

And of the two, to that one whom he consider about to be saved, he said: "Mention me to thy lord." But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord: and (Joseph) lingered in prison a few (more) years.

And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released: "Mention me in the presence of thy lord." But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord, so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years.

And he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two: "Remember me with your lord; but the Shaitan caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so he remained in the prison a few years."

The king (of Egypt) said: "I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions."

And the king said: "Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating, and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry. O notables! Expound for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams."

And the king said: "Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and seven green ears and (seven) others dry: O chiefs! explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream."

They said: "A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams."

They answered: "Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams."

They said: "Confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams."

But the man who had been released, one of the two (who had been in prison) and who now bethought him after (so long) a space of time, said: "I will tell you the truth of its interpretation: send ye me (therefore)."

And he of the two who was released, and (now) at length remembered, said: "I am going to announce unto you the interpretation, therefore send me forth."

And of the two (prisoners) he who had found deliverance and remembered after a long time said: "I will inform you of its interpretation, so let me go."

"O Joseph!" (he said) "O man of truth! Expound to us (the dream) of seven fat kine whom seven lean ones devour, and of seven green ears of corn and (seven) others withered: that I may return to the people, and that they may understand.""O thou truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry, that I may return unto the people, so that they may know."

Yusuf said: "You shall sow for seven years continuously, then what you reap leave it in its ear except a little of which you eat. Then there shall come after that seven years of hardship which shall eat away all that you have beforehand laid up in store for them, except a little of what you shall have preserved. Then there will come after that a year in which people shall have rain and in which they shall press (grapes)."

So the king said: "Bring him unto me." But when the messenger came to him, Yusuf said: "Go back to your lord and ask him, what is the case of the women who cut their hands; surely my Lord knows their guile."

The king said (to the ladies): "What was your affair when you sought to seduce Yusuf?" They said: "Remote is God (from imperfection), we knew of no evil on his part." The chief's wife said: "Now has the truth become established: I sought him to yield himself (to me), and he is most surely of the truthful ones."

Yusuf said: "This is that he might know that I have not been unfaithful to him in secret and that God does not guide the device of the unfaithful. And I do not declare myself free, most surely (man's) self is wont to command (him to do) evil, except such as my Lord has had mercy on, surely my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."

So the king said: "Bring him to me, I will choose him for myself." So when he had spoken with him, he said: "Surely you are in our presence today an honorable, a faithful one."

Yusuf said: "Place me (in authority) over the treasures of the land, surely I am a good keeper, knowing well."

Thus did We give to Yusuf power in the land he had mastery in it wherever he liked; We send down Our mercy on whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of those who do good. And certainly the reward of the hereafter is much better for those who believe and guard (against evil).

Then Yusuf's brothers came and went in to him, and he knew them, while they did not recognize him. And when he furnished them with their provision, he said: "Bring to me a brother of yours from your father; do you not see that I give full measure and that I am the best of hosts? But if you do not bring him to me, you shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall you come near me."

They said: "We will strive to make his father yield in respect of him, and we are sure to do (it)."

And he said to his servants: "Put their money into their bags that they may recognize it when they go back to their family, so that they may come back."

So when they returned to their father, they said: "O our father, the measure is withheld from us, therefore send with us our brother, (so that) we may get the measure, and we will most surely guard him."

He said: "I cannot trust in you with respect to him, except as I trusted in you with respect to his brother before; but God is the best Keeper, and He is the most Merciful of the merciful ones."

And when they opened their goods, they found their money returned to them. They said: "O our father! what (more) can we desire? This is our property returned to us, and we will bring corn for our family and guard our brother, and will have in addition the measure of a camel (load); this is an easy measure."

He said: "I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of God."Shu'aib. He said: "O my people! Serve God, you have no god other than He, and do not give short measure and weight: surely I see you in prosperity and surely I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing day."

"And O my people! Give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due: commit not evil in the land with intent to do mischief."

"O my people! Give full measure and full weight in justice, and wrong not people in respect of their goods. And do not evil in the earth, causing corruption."

"And, O my people! Give full measure and weight fairly, and defraud not men their things, and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief."

"That which is left you by God is best for you, if ye (but) believed! But I am not set over you to keep watch!"

"That which God leaveth with you is better for you if ye are believers; and I am not a keeper over you."

They said: "O Shu'aib! Does thy (religion of) prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doing what we like with our property? Truly, thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded!"

They said: "O Shu'eyb! Doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should forsake that which our fathers (used to) worship, or that we (should leave off) doing what we will with our own property. Lo! thou art the mild, the guide to right behaviour."

They said: "O Shu'aib! Does your prayer enjoin you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property? Forsooth you are the forbearing, the right-directing one."

He said: "O my people! See ye whether I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord, and He hath given me sustenance (pure and) good as from Himself? I wish not, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from God. In Him I trust, and unto Him I look."

He said: "O my people! Bethink you: if I am (acting) on a clear proof from my Lord and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him (how can I concede aught to you)? I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do. I desire naught save reform so far as I am able. My welfare is only in God. In Him I trust and unto Him I turn (repentant)."

He said: "O my people! Have you considered if I have a clear proof from my Lord and He has given me a goodly sustenance from Himself, and I do not desire that in opposition to you I should betake myself to that which I forbid you: I desire nothing but reform so far as I am able, and with none but God is the direction of my affair to a right issue; on Him do I rely and to Him I turn."

"And O my people! Let not my dissent (from you) cause you to sin, lest ye suffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hud or of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you!"

"And, O my people! Let not the schism with me cause you to sin so that there befall you that which befell the folk of Noah and the folk of Hud, and the folk of Salih; and the folk of Lot are not far off from you."

"And, O my people! Let not opposition to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of what befell the people of Nuh, or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you."

"But ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him (in repentance): For my Lord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness."

"Ask pardon of your Lord and then turn unto Him (repentant). Lo! my Lord is Merciful, Loving."

"And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him; surely my Lord is Merciful, Loving-kind."

They said: "O Shu'aib! Much of what thou sayest we do not understand! In fact among us we see that thou hast no strength! Were it not for thy family, we should certainly have stoned thee! For thou hast among us no great position!"

They said: "O Shu'eyb! We understand not much of that thou tellest, and lo! we do behold thee weak among us. But for thy family, we should have stoned thee, for thou art not strong against us."

They said: "O Shu'aib! We do not understand much of what you say and most surely we see you to be weak among us, and were it not for your family we would surely stone you, and you are not mighty against us."

He said: "O my people! Is then my family of more consideration with you than God? For ye cast Him away behind your backs (with contempt). But verily my Lord encompasseth on all sides all that ye do!"

He said: "O my people! Is my family more to be honoured by you than God? And ye put Him behind you, neglected! Lo! my Lord surroundeth what ye do."

He said: "O my people! Is my family more esteemed by you than God? And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your back; surely my Lord encompasses what you do."

"And O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): Soon will ye know who it is on whom descends the penalty of ignominy; and who is a liar! And watch ye! For I too am watching with you!"

"And, O my people! Act according to your power, lo! I (too) am acting. Ye will soon know on whom there cometh a doom that will abase him, and who it is that lieth. And watch! Lo! I am a watcher with you."

"And, O my people! Act according to your ability, I too am acting; you will come to know soon who it is on whom will light the punishment that will disgrace him and who it is that is a liar, and watch, surely I too am watching with you."

When Our decree issued, We saved Shu'aib and those who believed with him, by (special) mercy from Ourselves: But the (mighty) blast did seize the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,-

And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Shu'eyb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the (Awful) Cry seized those who did injustice, and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings,

And when Our decree came to pass We delivered Shu'aib, and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless bodies in their abodes,

As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! Ah! Behold! How the Madyan were removed (from sight) as were removed the Thamud!

As though they had not dwelt there. A far removal for Midian, even as Thamud had been removed afar!

As though they had never dwelt in them; now surely perdition overtook Madyan as had perished Samood.

And We sent Moses, with Our Clear (Signs) and an authority manifest,

And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant,

And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and a clear authority,

Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: but they followed the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was no right (guide).

Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they did follow the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was no right guide.

To Firon and his chiefs, but they followed the bidding of Firon, and Firon's bidding was not right-directing.

He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment, and lead them into the Fire (as cattle are led to water): But woeful indeed will be the place to which they are led!

He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will lead them to the Fire for watering-place. Ah, hapless is the watering-place (whither they are) led.

He shall lead his people on the resurrection day, and bring them down to the fire; and evil the place to which they are brought.

And they are followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Judgment: and woeful is the gift which shall be given (unto them)!

A curse is made to follow them in the world and on the Day of Resurrection. Hapless is the gift (that will be) given (them).

And they are overtaken by curse in this (world), and on the resurrection day, evil the gift which shall be given.

These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee: of them some are standing, and some have been mown down (by the sickle of time).

That is (something) of the tidings of the townships (which were destroyed of old). We relate it unto thee (Muhammad). Some of them are standing and some (already) reaped.

This is an account of (the fate of) the towns which We relate to you; of them are some that stand and (others) mown down.

It was not We that wronged them: They wronged their own souls: the deities, other than God, whom they invoked, profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord: Nor did they add aught (to their lot) but perdition!

We wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves; and their gods on whom they call beside God availed them naught when came thy Lord's command; they added to them naught save ruin.

And We did not do them injustice, but they were unjust to themselves, so their gods whom they called upon besides God did not avail them aught when the decree of your Lord came to pass; and they added but to their ruin.

Such is the chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in the midst of their wrong: grievous, indeed, and severe is His chastisement.

Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while they are doing wrong. Lo! His grasp is painful, very strong.

And such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are unjust; surely His punishment is painful, severe.

In that is a Sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter: that is a Day for which mankind will be gathered together: that will be a Day of Testimony.

Lo! herein verily there is a portent for those who fear the doom of the Hereafter. That is a day unto which mankind will be gathered, and that is a day that will be witnessed.

Most surely there is a sign in this for him who fears the chastisement of the hereafter; this is a day on which the people shall be gathered together and this is a day that shall be witnessed.

Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed.

And We defer it only to a term already reckoned.

And We do not delay it but to an appointed term.

The day it arrives, no soul shall speak except by His leave: of those (gathered) some will be wretched and some will be blessed.

On the day when it cometh no soul will speak except by His permission; some among them will be wretched, (others) glad.

On the day when it shall come, no soul shall speak except with His permission, then (some) of them shall be unhappy and (others) happy.

Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing but) the heaving of sighs and sobs."Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire; sighing and wailing will be their portion therein. They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord wills: for thy Lord is the accomplisher of what He plans. And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord wills: a gift without break. Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before them: but verily We shall pay them back their portion without abatement. We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose therein: had it not been that a word had gone forth from thy Lord, the matter would have been decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it. And, of a surety, to all will your Lord pay back the recompense of their deeds: for He knows well all that they do. Therefore stand firm in the straight Path as thou art commanded, thou and those who with thee turn unto God; and transgress not from the Path: for He sees well all that ye do. And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than God, nor shall ye be helped. And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: For those things, that are good remove those that are evil: Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember their Lord. And be steadfast in patience; for verily God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish. Why were there not, among the generations before you, persons possessed of balanced good sense, prohibiting men from mischief in the earth - except a few among them whom We saved from harm? But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoyment of the good things of life which were given them, and persisted in sin. Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrong-doing, if its members were likely to mend. If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one people: but they will not cease to dispute. Except those on whom thy Lord has bestowed His Mercy: and for this did He create them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: 'I will fill Hell with jinns and men all together.' All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers, with it We make firm thy heart: in them there comes to thee the Truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe. Say to those who do not believe: 'Do whatever ye can: We shall do our part;' And wait ye! We too shall wait. To God do belong the unseen secrets of the heavens and the earth, and to Him goes back every affair for decision: then worship Him, and put thy trust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do.""f God that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded." And when they gave him their undertaking, he said: "God is the Warden over what we say."

He said: "I will by no means send him with you until you give me a firm covenant in God's name that you will most certainly bring him back to me, unless you are completely surrounded." And when they gave him their covenant, he said: "God is the One in Whom trust is placed as regards what we say."

Further, he said: "O my sons! Enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against God (with my advice): None can command except God: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him."

And he said: "O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I can naught avail you as against God. Lo! the decision rests with God only. In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust."

And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) God: It was but a necessity of Jacob's soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.

And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against God; it was but a need of Jacob's soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.

And when they had entered as their father had bidden them, it did not avail them aught against God, but (it was only) a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied; and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge, but most people do not know.

Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): "Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings."

And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto him, saying: "Lo! I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did."

And when they went in to Yusuf, he lodged his brother with himself, saying: "I am your brother, therefore grieve not at what they do."

At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: "O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt!"

And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag, and then a crier cried: "O camel-riders! Lo! ye are surely thieves!"

So when he furnished them with their provisions, (someone) placed the drinking cup in his brother's bag. Then a crier cried out: "O caravan! you are most surely thieves."

They said, turning towards them: "What is it that ye miss?"

They cried, coming toward them: "What is it ye have lost?"

They said while they were facing them: "What is it that you miss?"

They said: "We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it."

They said: "We have lost the king's cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a camel-load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it."

They said: "We miss the king's drinking cup, and he who shall bring it shall have a camel-load and I am responsible for it."

(The brothers) said: "By God! well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!"

They said: "By God, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and are no thieves."

They said: "By God! you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves."

(The Egyptians) said: "What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are (proved) to have lied?"

They said: "And what shall be the penalty for it, if ye prove liars?"

They said: "But what shall be the requital of this, if you are liars?"

They said: "The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime). Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers!"

They said: "The penalty for it! He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the penalty for it. Thus we requite wrong-doers."

They said: "The requital of this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself be (held for) the satisfaction thereof; thus do we punish the wrongdoers."

So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that God willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one, the All-Knowing.

Then he (Joseph) began the search with their bags before his brother's bag, then he produced it from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother according to the king's law unless God willed. We raise by grades (of mercy) whom We will, and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing.

So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother, then he brought it out from his brother's sack. Thus did We plan for the sake of Yusuf; it was not (lawful) that he should take his brother under the king's law unless God pleased; We raise the degrees of whomsoever We please, and above every one possessed of knowledge is the All-knowing one.

They said: "If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him)." But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): "Ye are the worse situated; and God knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!"

They said: "If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before." But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said (within himself): "Ye are in worse case, and God knoweth best (the truth of) that which ye allege."

They said: "If he steal, a brother of his did indeed steal before;" but Yusuf kept it secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them. He said: "You are in an evil condition and God knows best what you state."

They said: "O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable, (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good."

They said: "O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath a very aged father, so take one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness."

They said: "O chief! he has a father, a very old man, therefore retain one of us in his stead; surely we see you to be of the doers of good."

He said: "God forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so), we should be acting wrongfully."

He said: "God forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property; then truly we should be wrong-doers."

He said: "God protect us that we should seize other than him with whom we found our property, for then most surely we would be unjust."

Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: "Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in God's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, or God commands me; and He is the best to command."

So, when they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them said: "Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in God's name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime? Therefore I shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or God judgeth for me. He is the Best of Judges."

Then when they despaired of him, they retired, conferring privately together. The eldest of them said: "Do you not know that your father took from you a covenant in God's name, and how you fell short of your duty with respect to Yusuf before? Therefore I will by no means depart from this land until my father permits me or God decides for me, and He is the best of the judges."

"Turn ye back to your father, and say, 'O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! we bear witness only to what we know, and we could not well guard against the unseen!"

Return unto your father and say: "O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen."

Go back to your father and say: "O our father! surely your son committed theft, and we do not bear witness except to what we have known, and we could not keep watch over the unseen."

"Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned, and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth."

Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled hither. Lo! we speak the truth.

And inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan with which we proceeded, and most surely we are truthful.

Jacob said: "Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe God will bring them (back) all to me (in the end). For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom."

(And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said: "Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience! It may be that God will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the Knower, the Wise."

He (Yaqoub) said: "Nay, your souls have made a matter light for you, so patience is good; maybe God will bring them all together to me; surely He is the Knowing, the Wise."

And he turned away from them, and said: "How great is my grief for Joseph!" And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy.

And he turned away from them and said: "Alas, my grief for Joseph!" And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing.

And he turned away from them, and said: "O my sorrow for Yusuf!" and his eyes became white on account of the grief, and he was a repressor (of grief).

They said: "By God! (never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!"

They said: "By God, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish!"

They said: "By God! you will not cease to remember Yusuf until you are a prey to constant disease or (until) you are of those who perish.""He said: 'I only complain of my distraction and anguish to God, and I know from God that which you do not know.'"

"O my sons! Go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of God's Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of God's Soothing Mercy, except those who have no faith."

Then, when they came back into Joseph's presence, they said: "O exalted one! Distress has seized us and our family: we have brought but scanty capital, so pay us full measure and treat it as charity to us, for God rewards the charitable."

He said: "Do you know how you treated Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?"

They said: "Are you indeed Joseph?" He said: "I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has indeed been gracious to us. He who is righteous and patient, God will not let the reward of those who do right be lost."

They said: "By God! Indeed, God has preferred you above us, and we certainly have been guilty of sin!"

He said: "This day let no reproach be cast on you. God will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."

"Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will come to see clearly. Then come to me together with all your family."

When the caravan left Egypt, their father said: "I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph. Do not think me a dotard."

They said: "By God! Truly you are in your old wandering mind."

Then when the bearer of the good news came, he cast the shirt over his face, and he regained clear sight. He said: "Did I not say to you, 'I know from God that which you do not know?'"

They said: "O our father! Ask for us forgiveness for our sins, for we were truly at fault."

He said: "Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you; He is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

Then when they entered the presence of Joseph, he provided a home for his parents with himself, and said: "Enter Egypt in safety if it pleases God."

And he raised his parents high on the throne of dignity, and they fell down in prostration before him. He said: "O my father! This is the fulfillment of my vision of old! God has made it come true. He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you all here out of the desert, even after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Verily my Lord understands best the mysteries of all that He plans to do, for He is full of knowledge and wisdom."

"O my Lord! You have indeed bestowed on me some power and taught me the interpretation of dreams and events. O Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Take my soul at death as one submitting to Your will, and unite me with the righteous."

Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen, which We reveal by inspiration to you. You were not present with them when they concerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots.

Yet no faith will the greater part of mankind have, however ardently you desire it.

And no reward do you ask of them for this; it is no less than a message for all creatures.

And how many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet they turn away from them!

And most of them do not believe in God without associating others with Him.

Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the wrath of God, or of the coming against them of the final Hour all of a sudden while they perceive not?

Say: "This is my way: I do invite unto God, on evidence clear as the seeing with one's eyes, I and whoever follows me. Glory to God! And never will I join gods with God!"

Nor did We send before you as messengers any but men, whom We did inspire, living in human habitations. Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them?the children of Yaqoub, as He made it complete before to your fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq; surely your Lord is Knowing, Wise. Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs for seekers after Truth. They said: "Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we: But we are a goodly body! really our father is obviously wandering in his mind!" When they said: Verily Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, many though we be. Lo! our father is in plain aberration. When they said: Certainly Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we, though we are a stronger company; most surely our father is in manifest error: "Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some unknown land, that so the favour of your father may be given to you alone: (there will be time enough) for you to be righteous after that!" (One said): Kill Joseph or cast him to some other land, so that your father's favour may be all for you, and (that) ye may afterward be righteous folk. Slay Yusuf or cast him forth into some land, so that your father's regard may be exclusively for you, and after that you may be a righteous people. Said one of them: "Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers." One among them said: Kill not Joseph but, if ye must be doing, fling him into the depth of the pit; some caravan will find him. A speaker from among them said: Do not slay Yusuf, and cast him down into the bottom of the pit if you must do it, so that some of the travellers may pick him up. They said: "O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph,- seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?" They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, when lo! we are good friends to him? They said: O our father! what reason have you that you do not trust in us with respect to Yusuf? And most surely we are his sincere well-wishers: "Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him." Send him with us to-morrow that he may enjoy himself and play. And lo! we shall take good care of him. Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and sport, and surely we will guard him well. (Jacob) said: "Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him." He said: Lo! in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you, and I fear less the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him. He said: Surely it grieves me that you should take him off, and I fear lest the wolf devour him while you are heedless of him. They said: "If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we indeed (first) have perished ourselves!" They said: If the wolf should devour him when we are (so strong) a band, then surely we should have already perished. They said: Surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are a (strong) company, we should then certainly be losers. So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): 'Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they know (thee) not' Then, when they led him off, and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit, We inspired in him: Thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know (thee) not. So when they had gone off with him and agreed that they should put him down at the bottom of the pit, and We revealed to him: You will most certainly inform them of this their affair while they do not perceive. Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping. And they came weeping to their father in the evening. And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping. They said: "O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things; and the wolf devoured him. But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth." Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying even when we speak the truth. They said: O our father! surely we went off racing and left Yusuf by our goods, so the wolf devoured him, and you will not believe us though we are truthful. They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: "Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is God (alone) Whose help can be sought." And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience. And God it is Whose help is to be sought in that (predicament) which ye describe. And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. He said: Nay, your souls have made the matter light for you, but patience is good and God is He Whose help is sought for against what you describe. Then there came a caravan of travellers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well). He said: "Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man!" So they concealed him as a treasure! But God knoweth well all that they do! And there came a caravan, and they sent their waterdrawer. He let down his pail (into the pit). He said: Good luck! Here is a youth. And they hid him as a treasure, and God was Aware of what they did. And there came travellers and they sent their water-drawer and he let down his bucket. He said: O good news! this is a youth; and they concealed him as an article of merchandise, and God knew what they did. The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him! And they sold him for a low price, a number of silver coins; and they attached no value to him. And they sold him for a small price, a few pieces of silver, and they showed no desire for him. The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: "Make his stay (among us) honourable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And God hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not. And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife: Receive him honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son. Thus we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And God was predominant in His career, but most of mankind know not. And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife: Give him an honorable abode, maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And thus did We establish Yusuf in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings; and God is the master of His affair, but most people do not know. When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right. And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward the good. And when he had attained his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge: and thus do We reward those who do good. But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: "Now come, thou (dear one)!" He said: "God forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!" And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the doors and said: Come! He said: I seek refuge in God! Lo! he is my lord, who hath treated me honourably. Lo! wrong-doers never prosper. And she in whose house he was sought to make himself yield (to her), and she made fast the doors and said: Come forward. He said: I seek God's refuge, surely my Lord made good my abode: Surely the unjust do not prosper. And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified. She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness. Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves. And certainly she made for him, and he would have made for her, were it not that he had seen the manifest evidence of his Lord; thus (it was) that We might turn away from him evil and indecency, surely he was one of Our sincere servants. So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door. She said: "What is the (fitting) punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or a grievous chastisement?" And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they met her lord and master at the door. She said: What shall be his reward, who wisheth evil to thy folk, save prison or a painful doom? And they both hastened to the door, and she rent his shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door. She said: What is the punishment of him who intends evil to your wife except imprisonment or a painful chastisement? He said: "It was she that sought to seduce me - from my (true) self." And one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus): "If it be that his shirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar!" (Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act. And a witness of her own folk testified: If his shirt is torn from before, then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars. He said: She sought to make me yield (to her); and a witness of her own family bore witness: If his shirt is rent from front, she speaks the truth and he is one of the liars: "But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the liar, and he is telling the truth!" And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the truthful. And if his shirt is rent from behind, she tells a lie and he is one of the truthful. So when he saw his shirt,- that it was torn at the back,- (her husband) said: "Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly, mighty is your snare!" So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: Lo!"ore them? But the home of the hereafter is best, for those who do right. Will ye not then understand? We sent not before thee any messengers save men whom We inspired from among the folk of the townships. Have they not traveled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? And verily the abode of the Hereafter, for those who ward off evil, is best. Have ye then no sense? And We have not sent before you but men from among the people of the towns, to whom We sent revelations. Have they not then traveled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? And certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those who guard against evil; do you not then understand?

Until, when the messengers give up hope of their people and think that they were treated as liars, there reaches them Our help, and those whom We will are delivered into safety. But never will be warded off our punishment from those who are in sin. Till, when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied, then came unto them Our help, and whom We would was saved. And Our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty. Until when the messengers despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed told a lie, Our help came to them and whom We pleased was delivered; and Our punishment is not averted from the guilty people.

There is, in their stories, instruction for men endued with understanding. It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it, a detailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe. In their history, verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is no invented story but a confirmation of the existing Scripture and a detailed explanation of everything, and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe. In their histories, there is certainly a lesson for men of understanding. It is not a narrative which could be forged, but a verification of what is before it and a distinct explanation of all things and a guide and a mercy to a people who believe.

Chapter 13: AL-RAD (THE THUNDER)
Total Verses: 43
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A.L.M.R. These are the signs of the Book: that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth; but most men believe not. Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not. Alif Lam Mim Ra. These are the verses of the Book; and that which is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.

God is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne of authority; He has subjected the sun and the moon to His Law! Each one runs its course for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord. God it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted the Throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service, each running unto an appointed term; He ordereth the course; He detaileth the revelations, that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. God is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see, and He is firm in power and He made the sun and the moon subservient to you; each one pursues its course to an appointed time; He regulates the affair, making clear the signs that you may be certain of meeting your Lord.

And it is He who spread out the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and flowing rivers: and fruit of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil over the Day. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who consider! And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and female). He covereth the night with the day. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who take thought. And He it is Who spread the earth and made in it firm mountains and rivers, and of all fruits He has made in it two kinds; He makes the night cover the day; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.

And in the earth are tracts diverse though neighboring, and gardens of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees growing out of single roots or otherwise: watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who understand! And in the Earth are neighboring tracts, vineyards and ploughed lands, and date-palms, like and unlike, which are watered with one water. And we have made some of them to excel others in fruit. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who have sense. And in the earth there are tracts side by side and gardens of grapes and corn and palm trees having one root and others having distinct roots they are watered with one water, and We make some of them excel others in fruit; most surely there are signs in this for a people who understand.

If thou dost marvel at their want of faith, strange is their saying: "When we are actually dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes of servitude: they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein for aye! And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their saying: When we are dust, are we then forsooth to be raised in a new creation? Such are they who disbelieve in their Lord; such have carcans on their necks; such are rightful owners of the Fire, they will abide therein. And if you would wonder, then wondrous is their saying: What! when we are dust, shall we then certainly be in a new creation? These are they who disbelieve in their Lord, and these have chains on their necks, and they are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.

They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to pass, before them, many exemplary punishments! But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is also strict in punishment. And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good, when exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them. But lo! thy Lord is rich in pardon for mankind despite their wrong, and lo! thy Lord is strong in punishment. And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good, and indeed there have been exemplary punishments before them; and most surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness to people, notwithstanding their injustice; and most surely your Lord is severe in requiting evil.

And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide. Those who disbelieve say: If only some portent were sent down upon him from his Lord! Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide. And those who disbelieve say: Why has not a sign been sent down upon him from his Lord? You are only a warner and there is a guide for every people.

God doth know what every female womb doth bear, by how much the wombs fall short of their time or number or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight, in due proportion. God knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured. God knows what every female bears, and that of which the wombs fall short of completion and that in which they increase; and there is a measure with Him of everything.

He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is the Great, the Most High. He is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Great, the High Exalted. The knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Most High.

It is the same to Him whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day. Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad, he who lurketh in the night and he who goeth freely in the daytime. Alike to Him among you is he who conceals his words and he who speaks them openly, and he who hides himself by night and who goes forth by day.

For each such person there are angels in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by command of God. God does not change a people's lot unless they change what is in their hearts. But when once God willeth a people's punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect. For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by God's command. Lo! God changeth not the condition of a folk until they first change that which is in their hearts; and if God willeth misfortune for a folk there is none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him. For his sake there are angels following one another, before him and behind him, who guard him by God's commandment; surely God does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when God intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector.

It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with fertilizing rain! He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the heavy clouds. He it is Who shows you the lightning causing fear and hope and Who brings up the heavy cloud.

Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He flingeth the loud-voiced thunderbolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will. Yet these are the men who dare to dispute about God, with the strength of His power supreme! The thunder hymneth His praise and so do the angels for awe of Him. He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute in doubt concerning God, and He is mighty in wrath. And the thunder declares His glory with His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him; and He sends the thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases, yet they dispute concerning God, and He is mighty in prowess.

For Him alone is prayer in Truth: any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but futile wandering in the mind. Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom the"To Him is due the true prayer; and those whom they pray to besides God give them no answer, but they are like one who stretches forth his hands towards water that it may reach his mouth, but it will not reach it; and the prayer of the unbelievers is only in error.

Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to God, willingly or unwillingly, and their shadows in the morning and evenings.

Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "It is God." Say: "Do you then take for worship protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?" Or do they assign to God partners who have created anything as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: "God is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible."

He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that ore which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus does God show forth Truth and Vanity. For the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus does God set forth parables.

For those who respond to their Lord, are all good things. But those who respond not to Him, even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much more, in vain would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible: their abode will be Hell, what a bed of misery!

Is then one who knows that what has been revealed unto you from your Lord is the Truth, like one who is blind? It is those who are endowed with understanding that receive admonition.

Those who fulfill the covenant of God and fail not in their plighted word; those who join together those things which God has commanded to be joined, hold their Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning; those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; establish regular prayers; spend, out of the gifts We have bestowed for their sustenance, secretly and openly; and turn off evil with good: for such there is the final attainment of the eternal home.

Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate with the salutation: "Peace unto you for that you persevered in patience! Now how excellent is the final home!"

But those who break the Covenant of God, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which God has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land; on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home!

God enlarges, or grants by strict measure, the sustenance which He gives to whomsoever He pleases. They rejoice in the life of this world, but the life of this world is but little comfort in the Hereafter.

The Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Truly God leaves to stray whom He will; but He guides to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence."

Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of God: for without doubt in the remembrance of God do hearts find satisfaction.

For those who believe and work righteousness, is every blessedness, and a beautiful place of final return.

Thus have We sent you amongst a People before whom long since have other Peoples gone and passed away; in order that you might rehearse unto them what We send down unto you by inspiration; yet they reject Him, the Most Gracious! Say: "He is my Lord! There is no god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I turn!""This is of the guile of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great." So when he saw his shirt rent from behind, he said: "Surely it is a guile of you women; surely your guile is great."

"O Joseph, pass this over! (O wife), ask forgiveness for thy sin, for truly thou hast been at fault!" 

"O Yusuf! turn aside from this; and (O my wife)! ask forgiveness for your fault, surely you are one of the wrong-doers."

Ladies said in the City: "The wife of the (great) 'Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his (true) self: Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: we see she is evidently going astray."

And women in the city said: "The ruler's wife is asking of her slave-boy an ill-deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain aberration."

And women in the city said: "The chief's wife seeks her slave to yield himself (to her), surely he has affected her deeply with (his) love; most surely we see her in manifest error."

When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said (to Joseph), "Come out before them." When they saw him, they did extol him, and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said, "God preserve us! no mortal is this! this is none other than a noble angel!"

And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them a cushioned couch (to lie on at the feast) and gave to every one of them a knife and said (to Joseph): "Come out unto them!" And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, exclaiming: "God Blameless! This is no human being. This is not other than some gracious angel."

So when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them and prepared for them a repast, and gave each of them a knife, and said (to Yusuf): "Come forth to them." So when they saw him, they deemed him great, and cut their hands (in amazement), and said: "Remote is God (from imperfection); this is not a mortal; this is but a noble angel."

She said: "There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I did seek to seduce him from his (true) self but he did firmly save himself guiltless! And now, if he doth not my bidding, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and (what is more) be of the company of the vilest!"

She said: "This is he on whose account ye blamed me. I asked of him an evil act, but he proved continent, but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low."

She said: "This is he with respect to whom you blamed me, and certainly I sought his yielding himself (to me), but he abstained, and if he does not do what I bid him, he shall certainly be imprisoned, and he shall certainly be of those who are in a state of ignominy."

He said: "O my Lord! the prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me: Unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I should (in my youthful folly) feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant."

He said: "O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me, and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish."

He said: "My Lord! the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they invite me; and if Thou turn not away their device from me, I will yearn towards them and become (one) of the ignorant."

So his Lord hearkened to him (in his prayer), and turned away from him their snare: Verily He heareth and knoweth (all things).

So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is Hearer, Knower.

Thereupon his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their guile from him; surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

Then it occurred to the men, after they had seen the signs, (that it was best) to imprison him for a time.

And it seemed good to them (the men-folk) after they had seen the signs (of his innocence) to imprison him for a time.

Then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him till a time.

Now with him there came into the prison two young men. Said one of them: "I see myself (in a dream) pressing wine." said the other: "I see myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating, thereof." "Tell us" (they said) "The truth and meaning thereof: for we see thou art one that doth good (to all)."

And two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: "I dreamed that I was pressing wine." The other said: "I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Announce unto us the interpretation, for we see thee of those good (at interpretation)."

And two youths entered the prison with him. One of them said: "I saw myself pressing wine." And the other said: "I saw myself carrying bread on my head, of which birds ate. Inform us of its interpretation; surely we see you to be of the doers of good."

He said: "Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me. I have (I assure you) abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in God and that (even) deny the Hereafter."

He said: "The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in God and are disbelievers in the Hereafter."

He said: "There shall not come to you the food with which you are fed, but I will inform you both of its interpretation before it comes to you; this is of what my Lord has taught me; surely I have forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in God, and they are deniers of the hereafter."

"And I follow the ways of my fathers,- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and never could we attribute any partners whatever to God: that (comes) of the grace of God to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful."

"And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to God. This is of the bounty of God unto us (the seed of Abraham) and unto mankind; but most men give not thanks."

"And I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub; it beseems us not that we should associate aught with God; this is by God's grace upon us and on mankind, but most people do not give thanks."

"O my two companions of the prison! (I ask you): are many lords differing among themselves better, or the One God, Supreme and Irresistible?"

"O my fellow-prisoners! Are divers lords better, or God the One, Almighty?"

"O my two mates of the prison! are sundry lords better or God the One, the Supreme?"

"If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and your fathers,- for which God hath sent down no authority: the command is for none but God: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men understand not."

"Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. God hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with God only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the right religion, but most men know not."

"You do not serve besides Him but names which you have named, you and your fathers; God has not sent down any authority for them; judgment is only God's; He has commanded that you shall not serve aught but Him; this is the right religion but most people do not know."

"O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head. (So) hath been decreed that matter whereof ye twain do enquire."

"O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire."

"O my two mates of the prison! as for one of you, he shall give his lord to drink wine; and as for the other, he shall be crucified, so that the birds shall eat from his head, the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired."

And of the two, to that one whom he consider about to be saved, he said: "Mention me to thy lord." But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord: and (Joseph) lingered in prison a few (more) years.

And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released: "Mention me in the presence of thy lord." But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord, so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years.

And he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two: "Remember me with your lord; but the Shaitan caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so he remained in the prison a few years."

The king (of Egypt) said: "I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions."

And the king said: "Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating, and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry. O notables! Expound for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams."

And the king said: "Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and seven green ears and (seven) others dry: O chiefs! explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream."

They said: "A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams."

They answered: "Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams."

They said: "Confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams."

But the man who had been released, one of the two (who had been in prison) and who now bethought him after (so long) a space of time, said: "I will tell you the truth of its interpretation: send ye me (therefore)."

And he of the two who was released, and (now) at length remembered, said: "I am going to announce unto you the interpretation, therefore send me forth."

And of the two (prisoners) he who had found deliverance and remembered after a long time said: "I will inform you of its interpretation, so let me go."

"O Joseph!" (he said) "O man of truth! Expound to us (the dream) of seven fat kine whom seven lean ones devour, and of seven green ears of corn and (seven) others withered: that I may return to the people, and that they may understand.""tions have passed away, that you might recite to them what We have revealed to you and (still) they deny the Beneficent God. Say: He is my Lord, there is no god but He; on Him do I rely and to Him is my return.

If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the command is with God in all things! Do not the Believers know, that, had God (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of God come to pass, for, verily, God will not fail in His promise.

Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the unbelievers, and finally I punished them: Then how (terrible) was my requital!

Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to God. Say: "But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?" Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom God leaves to stray, no one can guide.

For them is a penalty in the life of this world, but harder, truly, is the penalty of the Hereafter: and defender have they none against God.

The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised!- beneath it flow rivers: perpetual is the enjoyment thereof and the shade therein: such is the end of the Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers in the Fire.

Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed unto thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: "I am commanded to worship God, and not to join partners with Him. Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my return."

Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Wert thou to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither protector nor defender against God.

We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of a messenger to bring a sign except as God permitted (or commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed).

God doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book.

Whether We shall show thee (within thy life-time) part of what we promised them or take to ourselves thy soul (before it is all accomplished),- thy duty is to make (the Message) reach them: it is our part to call them to account.

See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? (Where) God commands, there is none to put back His Command: and He is swift in calling to account.

Those before them did (also) devise plots; but in all things the master-planning is God's He knoweth the doings of every soul: and soon will the Unbelievers know who gets home in the end.

The Unbelievers say: "No messenger art thou." Say: "Enough for a witness between me and you is God, and such as have knowledge of the Book."

Chapter 14: IBRAHIM (ABRAHAM)
Total Verses: 52
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. R. A Book which We have revealed unto thee, in order that thou mightest lead mankind out of the depths of darkness into light - by the leave of their Lord - to the Way of (Him) the Exalted in power, worthy of all praise!

Of God, to Whom do belong all things in the heavens and on earth! But alas for the Unbelievers for a terrible penalty (their Unfaith will bring them)!

Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, who hinder (men) from the Path of God and seek therein something crooked: they are astray by a long distance.""O thou truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry, that I may return unto the people, so that they may know."

Yusuf (Joseph) said: "For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont: and the harvests that ye reap, ye shall leave them in the ear, except a little, of which ye shall eat."

"Then will come after that (period) seven dreadful (years), which will devour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them, except a little which ye shall have (specially) guarded."

"Then will come after that (period) a year in which the people will have abundant water, and in which they will press (wine and oil)."

So the king said: "Bring ye him unto me." But when the messenger came to him, Yusuf said: "Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands'? For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare."

The king said (to the ladies): "What was your affair when ye did seek to seduce Yusuf from his (true) self?" The ladies said: "God preserve us! no evil know we against him!" Said the 'Aziz's wife: "Now is the truth manifest (to all): it was I who sought to seduce him from his (true) self: He is indeed of those who are (ever) true (and virtuous)."

"This (say I), in order that He may know that I have never been false to him in his absence, and that God will never guide the snare of the false ones."

"Nor do I absolve my own self (of blame): the (human) soul is certainly prone to evil, unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

So the king said: "Bring him unto me; I will take him specially to serve about my own person." Therefore when he had spoken to him, he said: "Be assured this day, thou art, before our own presence, with rank firmly established, and fidelity fully proved!"

Yusuf said: "Set me over the store-houses of the land: I will indeed guard them, as one that knows (their importance)."

Thus did We give established power to Yusuf in the land, to take possession therein as, when, or where he pleased. We bestow of our Mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not, to be lost, the reward of those who do good.

But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best, for those who believe, and are constant in righteousness.

Then came Yusuf's brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them, but they knew him not.

And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he said: "Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves, (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that I do provide the best hospitality?"

"Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall ye (even) come near me."

They said: "We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father: Indeed we shall do it."

And (Yusuf) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they had bartered) into their saddle-bags, so they should know it only when they returned to their people, in order that they might come back.

Now when they returned to their father, they said: "O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him."

He said: "Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime? But God is the best to take care (of him), and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!"

Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them. They said: "O our father! What (more) can we desire? This our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel's load (of grain to our provisions). This is but a small quantity."

(Jacob) said: "Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me, in God's name, that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in (and made powerless)." And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: "Over all that we say, be God the witness and guardian!"This world's life more than the hereafter, and turn away from God's path and desire to make it crooked; these are in a great error.

We sent not a messenger except in the language of his people, in order to make things clear to them. Now God leaves straying those whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in power, full of Wisdom.

We sent Moses with Our signs and the command: "Bring out thy people from the depths of darkness into light, and teach them to remember the Days of God." Verily in this there are Signs for such as are firmly patient and constant, grateful and appreciative.

Remember! Moses said to his people: "Call to mind the favor of God to you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons, and let your women-folk live: therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord."

And remember! your Lord caused to be declared: "If ye are grateful, I will add more favors unto you; But if ye show ingratitude, truly My punishment is terrible indeed."

And Moses said: "If ye show ingratitude, ye and all on earth together, yet is God free of all wants, worthy of all praise."

Has not the story reached you of those who went before you? - of the people of Noah, and 'Ad, and Thamud? - And of those who came after them? None knows them but God. To them came messengers with Clear Signs; but they put their hands up to their mouths, and said: "We do deny the mission on which ye have been sent, and we are really in suspicious doubt as to that to which ye invite us."

Their messengers said: "Is there a doubt about God, The Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He Who invites you, in order that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed!" They said: "Ah! ye are no more than human, like ourselves! Ye wish to turn us away from the gods our fathers used to worship: then bring us some clear authority."

Their messengers said to them: "True, we are human like yourselves, but God doth grant His grace to such of His servants as He pleases. It is not for us to bring you an authority except as God permits. And on God let all men of faith put their trust."

"No reason have we why we should not put our trust on God. Indeed He Has guided us to the Ways we follow. We shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us. For those who put their trust should put their trust on God."

And the Unbelievers said to their messengers: "Be sure we shall drive you out of our land, or ye shall return to our religion." But their Lord inspired this Message to them: "Verily We shall cause the wrong-doers to perish!"

"And verily We shall cause you to abide in the land, and succeed them. This for such as fear the Time when they shall stand before My tribunal, such as fear the punishment denounced."

But they sought victory and decision there and then, and frustration was the lot of every powerful obstinate transgressor.

In front of such a one is Hell, and he is given, for drink, boiling fetid water. In gulps will he sip it, but never will he be near swallowing it down his throat: death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting.

The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous day: No power have they over aught that they have earned: that is the straying far, far from the goal.

Seest thou not that God created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He so will, He can remove you and put in your place a new creation. Nor is that for God any great matter.

They will all be marshalled before God together: then will the weak say to those who were arrogant, "For us, we but followed you; can ye then avail us to all against the wrath of God?" They will reply, "If we had received the Guidance of God, we should have given it to you: to us it makes no difference now whether we rage, or bear these torments with patience: for ourselves there is no way of escape.""Surely we were your followers, can you therefore avert from us any part of the chastisement of God?" They would say: "If God had guided us, we too would have guided you; it is the same to us whether we are impatient or patient, there is no place for us to fly to."

And Satan will say when the matter is decided: "It was God Who gave you a promise of Truth: I too promised, but I failed in my promise to you. I had no authority over you except to call you but you listened to me: then reproach not me, but reproach your own souls. I cannot listen to your cries, nor can you listen to mine. I reject your former act in associating me with God. For wrong-doers there must be a grievous penalty."

But those who believe and work righteousness will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever with the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: "Peace!"

Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? - A goodly word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord. So God sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition.

And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree: It is torn up by the root from the surface of the earth: it has no stability.

God will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but God will leave to stray those who do wrong: God does what He wills.

Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who have changed the favor of God into blasphemy and caused their people to descend to the House of Perdition? Into Hell? They will burn therein, an evil place to stay in!

And they set up idols as equal to God, to mislead men from the Path! Say: "Enjoy your brief power! But verily you are making straightway for Hell!"

Speak to my servants who have believed, that they may establish regular prayers, and spend in charity out of the sustenance we have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day in which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.

It is God Who has created the heavens and the earth and sends down rain from the skies, and with it brings out fruits to feed you; it is He Who has made the ships subject to you, that they may sail through the sea by His command; and the rivers also He has made subject to you.

And He has made subject to you the sun and the moon, both diligently pursuing their courses; and the night and the day He has also made subject to you.

And He gives you of all that you ask for. But if you count the favors of God, never will you be able to number them. Verily, man is given up to injustice and ingratitude.

Remember Abraham said: "O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols."

"O my Lord! they have indeed led astray many among mankind; He then who follows my ways is of me, and he that disobeys me, but Thou art indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks."

"O our Lord! truly Thou dost know what we conceal and what we reveal: for nothing whatever is hidden from God, whether on earth or in heaven."

"Praise be to God, Who has granted unto me in old age Isma'il and Isaac: for truly my Lord is He, the Hearer of Prayer!"

"O my Lord! make me one who establishes regular Prayer, and also raise such among my offspring. O our Lord! and accept Thou my Prayer."

"O our Lord! cover us with Thy Forgiveness - me, my parents, and all Believers, on the Day that the Reckoning will be established!"Think not that God does not heed the deeds of those who do wrong. He gives them respite against a Day when the eyes will stare in horror. They will come hurrying on in fear, their heads upraised, their gaze not returning to them, and their hearts vacant.

Warn mankind of the Day when the Wrath will reach them. The wrong-doers will say: "Our Lord! Reprieve us for a short term: we will answer Your call and follow the messengers." It will be answered: "Did you not swear before that there would be no end for you?"

You dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it is clear how We dealt with them. We have made them examples for you. Mighty indeed were the plots they made, but their plots were within the sight of God, even though they were such as to shake the hills.

Never think that God would fail His messengers in His promise. God is Exalted in power, the Lord of Retribution. One day the earth will be changed to a different earth, and so will the heavens, and men will be marshalled forth before God, the One, the Irresistible.

You will see the sinners that day bound together in fetters, their garments of liquid pitch, and their faces covered with Fire. God will requite each soul according to its deserts. Verily, God is swift in calling to account.

This is a clear message for mankind, that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is One God, and that men of understanding may take heed.

Chapter 15: AL-HIJR (STONELAND, ROCK CITY)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. R. These are the Ayats of Revelation, of a Qur'an that makes things clear. Those who disbelieve will wish that they had bowed to God's will in Islam. Let them enjoy life and let false hope amuse them; soon they will know.

We destroyed no population that had not a term decreed and assigned beforehand. No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind. They say: "O you to whom the Message is being revealed! Truly you are mad." They ask: "Why do you not bring angels to us if you are truthful?" We send not the angels down except for just cause; if they came, no respite would they have.

We have sent down the Message, and We will assuredly guard it from corruption. We sent messengers before you among the religious sects of old, but never came a messenger to them but they mocked him. Thus do We let it creep into the hearts of the sinners, that they should not believe in the Message; but the ways of the ancients have passed away.

Even if We opened a gate from heaven, and they were to continue ascending therein, they would say: "Our eyes have been intoxicated; we have been bewitched by sorcery." We have set out the zodiacal signs in the heavens and made them fair-seeming to all beholders. We have guarded them from every cursed devil, but any that gains a hearing by stealth is pursued by a flaming fire.

The earth We have spread out like a carpet, set thereon mountains firm and immovable, and produced therein all kinds of things in due balance. We have provided therein means of subsistence for you and for those for whose sustenance you are not responsible. There is not a thing but its sources and treasures are with Us; We only send down thereof in due and ascertainable measures.

We send the fecundating winds, then cause the rain to descend from the sky, providing you with water in abundance, though you are not the guardians of its stores."f God that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded. And when they gave him their undertaking he said: God is the Warden over what we say. He said: I will by no means send him with you until you give me a firm covenant in God's name that you will most certainly bring him back to me, unless you are completely surrounded. And when they gave him their covenant, he said: God is the One in Whom trust is placed as regards what we say.

Further he said: "O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against God (with my advice): None can command except God: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him." And he said: O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I can naught avail you as against God. Lo! the decision rests with God only. In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust.

And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) God: It was but a necessity of Jacob's soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not. And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against God; it was but a need of Jacob's soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.

Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): "Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings." And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto him, saying: Lo! I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did. And when they went in to Yusuf, he lodged his brother with himself, saying: I am your brother, therefore grieve not at what they do.

At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: "O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt!" And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag, and then a crier cried: O camel-riders! Lo! ye are surely thieves! So when he furnished them with their provisions, (someone) placed the drinking cup in his brother's bag. Then a crier cried out: O caravan! you are most surely thieves.

They said, turning towards them: "What is it that ye miss?" They cried, coming toward them: What is it ye have lost? They said while they were facing them: What is it that you miss? They said: "We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it." They said: We have lost the king's cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a camel-load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it. They said: We miss the king's drinking cup, and he who shall bring it shall have a camel-load and I am responsible for it.

(The brothers) said: "By God! well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!" They said: By God, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and are no thieves. They said: By God! you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves. (The Egyptians) said: "What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are (proved) to have lied?" They said: And what shall be the penalty for it, if ye prove liars? They said: But what shall be the requital of this, if you are liars?

They said: "The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime). Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers!" They said: The penalty for it! He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the penalty for it. Thus we requite wrong-doers. They said: The requital of this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself be (held for) the satisfaction thereof; thus do we punish the wrongdoers.

So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that God willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one, the All-Knowing. Then he (Joseph) began the search with their bags before his brother's bag, then he produced it from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother according to the king's law unless God willed. We raise by grades (of mercy) whom We will, and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing. So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother, then he brought it out from his brother's sack. Thus did We plan for the sake of Yusuf; it was not (lawful) that he should take his brother under the king's law unless God pleased; We raise the degrees of whomsoever We please, and above every one possessed of knowledge is the All-knowing one.

They said: "If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him)." But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): "Ye are the worse situated; and God knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!" They said: If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said (within himself): Ye are in worse case, and God knoweth best (the truth of) that which ye allege. They said: If he steal, a brother of his did indeed steal before; but Yusuf kept it secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them. He said: You are in an evil condition and God knows best what you state.

They said: "O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable, (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good." They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath a very aged father, so take one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness. They said: O chief! he has a father, a very old man, therefore retain one of us in his stead; surely we see you to be of the doers of good.

He said: "God forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so), we should be acting wrongfully." He said: God forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property; then truly we should be wrong-doers. He said: God protect us that we should seize other than him with whom we found our property, for then most surely we would be unjust.

Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: "Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in God's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, or God commands me; and He is the best to command." So, When they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them said: Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in God's name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime? Therefore I shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or God judgeth for me. He is the Best of Judges. Then when they despaired of him, they retired, conferring privately together. The eldest of them said: Do you not know that your father took from you a covenant in God's name, and how you fell short of your duty with respect to Yusuf before? Therefore I will by no means depart from this land until my father permits me or God decides for me, and He is the best of the judges:

"Turn ye back to your father, and say, 'O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! we bear witness only to what we know, and we could not well guard against the unseen!" Return unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen. Go back to your father and say: O our father! surely your son committed theft, and we do not bear witness except to what we have known, and we could not keep watch over the unseen:

"'Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned, and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth.'" Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled hither. Lo! we speak the truth. And inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan with which we proceeded, and most surely we are truthful.

Jacob said: "Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe God will bring them (back) all to me (in the end). For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom." (And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience! It may be that God will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the Knower, the Wise. He (Yaqoub) said: Nay, your souls have made a matter light for you, so patience is good; maybe God will bring them all together to me; surely He is the Knowing, the Wise.

And he turned away from them, and said: "How great is my grief for Joseph!" And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy. And he turned away from them and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing. And he turned away from them, and said: O my sorrow for Yusuf! and his eyes became white on account of the grief, and he was a repressor (of grief).

They said: "By God! (never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!" They said: By God, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish! They said: By God! you will not cease to remember Yusuf until you are a prey to constant disease or (until) you are of those who perish.We send the winds fertilizing, then send down water from the cloud so We give it to you to drink, nor is it you who store it up. And verily, it is We Who give life and death: it is We Who remain inheritors after all else passes away. To Us are known those of you who hasten forward, and those who lag behind. Assuredly it is thy Lord Who will gather them together: for He is perfect in Wisdom and Knowledge. We created man from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape; and the jinn race, We had created before, from the fire of a scorching wind.

Behold! thy Lord said to the angels: "I am about to create man, from sounding clay from mud molded into shape; when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him." So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together, except Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves. (God) said: "O Iblis! what is your reason for not being among those who prostrated themselves?" (Iblis) said: "I am not one to prostrate myself to man, whom Thou didst create from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape." (God) said: "Then get thee out from here; for thou art rejected, accursed. And the curse shall be on thee till the Day of Judgment."

(Iblis) said: "O my Lord! give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised." (God) said: "Respite is granted thee till the Day of the Time appointed." (Iblis) said: "O my Lord! because Thou hast put me in the wrong, I will make (wrong) fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will put them all in the wrong, except Thy servants among them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace)." (God) said: "This (way of My sincere servants) is indeed a way that leads straight to Me. For over My servants no authority shalt thou have, except such as put themselves in the wrong and follow thee." And verily, Hell is the promised abode for them all! To it are seven gates: for each of those gates is a (special) class (of sinners) assigned.

The righteous will be amid gardens and fountains (of clear-flowing water). (Their greeting will be): "Enter ye here in peace and security." And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury: (they will be) brothers (joyfully) facing each other on thrones (of dignity). There no sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they ever be asked to leave. Tell My servants that I am indeed the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful; and that My Penalty will be indeed the most grievous Penalty.

Tell them about the guests of Abraham. When they entered his presence and said, "Peace!" He said, "We feel afraid of you!" They said: "Fear not! We give thee glad tidings of a son endowed with wisdom." He said: "Do ye give me glad tidings that old age has seized me? Of what, then, is your good news?" They said: "We give thee glad tidings in truth: be not then in despair!" He said: "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, but such as go astray?" Abraham said: "What then is the business on which ye (have come), O ye messengers (of God)?" They said: "We have been sent to a people (deep) in sin, excepting the adherents of Lut: them we are certainly charged to save from harm, all except his wife, who, We have ascertained, will be among those who will lag behind."

At length when the messengers arrived among the adherents of Lut, he said: "Ye appear to be uncommon folk." They said: "Yea, we have come to thee to accomplish that of which they doubt. We have brought to thee that which is inevitably due, and assuredly we tell the truth." "Then travel by night with thy household, when a portion of the night yet remains, and do thou bring up the rear: let no one amongst you look back, but pass on whither ye are ordered.""He said: 'I only complain of my distraction and anguish to God, and I know from God that which you know not.' 

'O my sons! Go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of God's Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of God's Soothing Mercy, except those who have no faith.'

Then, when they came back into Joseph's presence, they said: 'O exalted one! Distress has seized us and our family: we have brought but scanty capital, so pay us full measure, and treat it as charity to us, for God rewards the charitable.'

He said: 'Do you know how you treated Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?'

They said: 'Are you indeed Joseph?' He said: 'I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has indeed been gracious to us. He who is righteous and patient, God will not let the reward of those who do right be lost.'

They said: 'By God! Indeed, God has preferred you above us, and we certainly have been guilty of sin!'

He said: 'This day let no reproach be cast on you. God will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.'

'Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will come to see clearly. Then come to me together with all your family.'

When the caravan left Egypt, their father said: 'I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph. Nay, think me not a dotard.'

They said: 'By God! Truly you are in your old wandering mind.'

Then when the bearer of the good news came, he cast the shirt over his face, and he regained clear sight. He said: 'Did I not say to you, I know from God that which you know not?'

They said: 'O our father! Ask for us forgiveness for our sins, for we were truly at fault.'

He said: 'Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you; He is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'

Then when they entered the presence of Joseph, he provided a home for his parents with himself, and said: 'Enter Egypt in safety if it pleases God.'

And he raised his parents high on the throne, and they fell down in prostration before him. He said: 'O my father! This is the fulfillment of my vision of old! God has made it come true. He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you all here out of the desert, even after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Verily my Lord understands best the mysteries of all that He plans to do, for He is full of knowledge and wisdom.'

'O my Lord! You have indeed bestowed on me some power, and taught me the interpretation of dreams and events. O Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Take my soul at death as one submitting to Your will, and unite me with the righteous.'

Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen, which We reveal by inspiration to you. You were not present with them when they concerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots.

Yet no faith will the greater part of mankind have, however ardently you desire it.

And no reward do you ask of them for this; it is no less than a message for all creatures.

And how many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet they turn their faces away from them!

And most of them do not believe in God without associating others with Him.

Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the wrath of God, or of the coming against them of the final Hour all of a sudden while they perceive not?

Say: 'This is my way: I call on God with sure knowledge, I and whoever follows me. Glory to God! And I am not of the idolaters.'

Nor did We send before you as messengers any but men, whom We did inspire, men living in human habitations. Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them?"And We made known this decree to him, that the last remnants of those (sinners) should be cut off by the morning. The inhabitants of the city came in joy at the news of the young men. Lut said: "These are my guests: disgrace me not." They said: "Did we not forbid thee from entertaining anyone?" He said: "There are my daughters (to marry), if ye must act so." But the mighty Blast overtook them before morning, and We turned the cities upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay. Behold! in this are Signs for those who understand. The cities were right on the high-road. The Companions of the Wood were also wrong-doers; so We exacted retribution from them. The Companions of the Rocky Tract also rejected the messengers. We sent them Our Signs, but they persisted in turning away from them. Out of the mountains did they hew their edifices, feeling themselves secure. But the mighty Blast seized them in the morning, and of no avail to them was all that they did with such art and care! We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, but for just ends. And the Hour is surely coming. So overlook any human faults with gracious forgiveness. For verily it is thy Lord who is the Master-Creator, knowing all things. And We have bestowed upon thee the Seven oft-repeated verses and the Grand Qur'an. Strain not thine eyes at what We have bestowed on certain classes of them, nor grieve over them: but lower thy wing in gentleness to the believers. And say: "I am indeed he that warneth openly and without ambiguity,"- of just such wrath as We sent down on those who divided Scripture into arbitrary parts. Therefore, by the Lord, We will, of a surety, call them to account for all their deeds. Therefore expound openly what thou art commanded, and turn away from those who join false gods with God. For sufficient are We unto thee against those who scoff,- those who adopt, with God, another god: but soon will they come to know. We do indeed know how thy heart is distressed at what they say. But celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and be of those who prostrate themselves in adoration. And serve thy Lord until there come unto thee the Hour that is Certain.And (He made) horses, mules, and asses for you to ride and as an ornament; and He creates what you do not know. God leads the straight Way, but there are ways that turn aside: if God had willed, He could have guided all of you. God's is the direction of the way, and some roads do not go straight. If He willed, He would have led you all aright. He sends down rain from the sky: from it you drink, and from it grows the vegetation on which you feed your cattle. He sends down water from the sky, from which you drink and from which trees grow for your beasts to pasture. With it, He produces corn, olives, date-palms, grapes, and every kind of fruit: verily in this is a sign for those who give thought. He causes crops to grow for you, and the olive, the date-palm, grapes, and all kinds of fruit. There is indeed a sign in this for people who reflect. He has made subject to you the Night and the Day; the sun and the moon; and the stars are in subjection by His Command: verily in this are Signs for men who are wise. He has constrained the night, the day, the sun, and the moon to be of service to you, and the stars are made subservient by His command. There are signs in this for people who ponder. He has created in the earth things of varying colors and qualities: verily in this is a sign for men who celebrate the praises of God in gratitude. He has created for you in the earth things of diverse hues; there is indeed a sign in this for people who take heed. He has made the sea subject to you, that you may eat fresh and tender flesh from it and extract ornaments to wear; and you see the ships plowing through it, that you may seek of His bounty and be grateful. He has constrained the sea to be of service so that you may eat fresh meat from it and bring forth ornaments to wear. You see the ships plowing through it, that you may seek His bounty and give thanks. He has set up on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; and rivers and roads, that you may guide yourselves. He has cast into the earth firm hills that it may not quake with you, and streams and roads that you may find a way. He has cast great mountains in the earth lest it might be convulsed with you, and rivers and roads that you may go aright. And landmarks and by the stars they find the right way. Is He who creates like one who does not create? Will you not receive admonition? If you would count the favors of God, you could never number them: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. God knows what you conceal and what you reveal. Those whom they invoke besides God create nothing and are themselves created. They are dead, not living, and they do not know when they will be raised. Your God is one God; as for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant. God knows what they conceal and what they reveal: He does not love the arrogant. When it is said to them, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "Tales of the ancients!" Let them bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Judgment, and also the burdens of those they misled without knowledge. How grievous the burdens they will bear! Those before them also plotted against God's Way, but God took their structures from their foundations, and the roof fell down on them from above; the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive. On the Day of Judgment, He will cover them with shame and say, "Where are My 'partners' concerning whom you used to dispute?" Those endowed with knowledge will say, "This Day, indeed, the Unbelievers are covered with shame and misery." Those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrongdoing to their own souls will offer submission, saying, "We did no evil knowingly." The angels will reply, "Nay, but God knows all that you did." So enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein. Evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant. To the righteous, when it is said, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "All that is good." For those who do good, there is good in this world, and the Home of the Hereafter is even better. Excellent indeed is the Home of the righteous. Gardens of Eternity which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow; they will have therein all that they wish. Thus does God reward the righteous. Those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity, saying to them, "Peace be on you; enter the Garden because of the good you did in the world." Do the ungodly wait until the angels come to them, or there comes the command of your Lord?comes the Command of thy Lord (for their doom)? So did those who went before them. But God wronged them not: nay, they wronged their own souls. They do not wait for anything but that the angels should come to them or that the commandment of your Lord should come to pass. Thus did those before them; and God was not unjust to them, but they were unjust to themselves. The evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that very Wrath at which they had scoffed hemmed them in.

The worshippers of false gods say: "If God had so willed, we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers, nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His." So did those who went before them. But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message? We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, with the Command, "Serve God, and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom God guided, and some on whom error became inevitably established. So travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who denied the Truth.

If you are anxious for their guidance, yet God does not guide such as He leaves to stray, and there is none to help them. They swear their strongest oaths by God, that God will not raise up those who die: Nay, but it is a promise binding on Him in truth, but most among mankind realize it not. They must be raised up, in order that He may manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ, and that the rejecters of Truth may realize that they had indeed surrendered to Falsehood. For to anything which We have willed, We but say the word, "Be", and it is.

To those who leave their homes in the cause of God, after suffering oppression, We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world; but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater. If they only realized this! They are those who persevere in patience, and put their trust in their Lord. And before you, the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We granted inspiration: if you realize this not, ask of those who possess the Message. We sent them with Clear Signs and Books of dark prophecies; and We have sent down unto you the Message, that you may explain clearly to men what is sent for them, and that they may give thought.

Do those who devise evil plots feel secure that God will not cause the earth to swallow them up, or that the Wrath will not seize them from directions they little perceive? Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to and fro, without a chance of their frustrating Him? Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - for your Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy. Do they not look at God's creation, even among inanimate things, how their very shadows turn round, from the right and the left, prostrating themselves to God, and that in the humblest manner?

To God does obeisance all that is in the heavens and on earth, whether moving creatures or the angels: for none are arrogant before their Lord. They all revere their Lord, high above them, and they do all that they are commanded. God has said: "Take not for worship two gods: for He is just One God: then fear Me and Me alone." To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth, and to Him is duty due always: then will you fear other than God? You have no good thing but is from God: and moreover, when you are touched by distress, unto Him you cry with groans.

Yet, when He removes the distress from you, behold! some of you turn to other gods to join with their Lord, as if to show their ingratitude for the favors We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy your brief day: but soon will you know your folly! They assign a portion of that which We have given them unto what they know not. By God! but you will indeed be asked concerning all that you used to invent.
But the home of the hereafter is best, for those who do right. Will ye not then understand? We sent not before thee (any messengers) save men whom We inspired from among the folk of the townships. Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? And verily the abode of the Hereafter, for those who ward off evil, is best. Have ye then no sense? And We have not sent before you but men from among the people of the towns, to whom We sent revelations. Have they not then travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? And certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those who guard against evil; do you not then understand?

(Respite will be granted) until, when the messengers give up hope of their people and come to think that they were treated as liars, there reaches them Our help, and those whom We will are delivered into safety. But never will be warded off our punishment from those who are in sin. Till, when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied, then came unto them Our help, and whom We would was saved. And Our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty. Until when the messengers despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed told a lie, Our help came to them and whom We pleased was delivered; and Our punishment is not averted from the guilty people.

There is, in their stories, instruction for men endued with understanding. It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it, a detailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe. In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is no invented story but a confirmation of the existing Scripture and a detailed explanation of everything, and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe.

Chapter 13: AL-RAD (THE THUNDER)
Total Verses: 43
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A.L.M.R. These are the signs (or verses) of the Book: that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth; but most men believe not. Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not. Alif Lam Mim Ra. These are the verses of the Book; and that which is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.

God is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne of authority; He has subjected the sun and the moon to His Law! Each one runs its course for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord. God it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted the Throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service, each runneth unto an appointed term; He ordereth the course; He detaileth the revelations, that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. God is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see, and He is firm in power and He made the sun and the moon subservient to you; each one pursues its course to an appointed time; He regulates the affair, making clear the signs that you may be certain of meeting your Lord.

And it is He who spread out the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and flowing rivers: and fruit of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil over the Day. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who consider! And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and female). He covereth the night with the day. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who take thought. And He it is Who spread the earth and made in it firm mountains and rivers, and of all fruits He has made in it two kinds; He makes the night cover the day; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.

And in the earth are tracts diverse though neighbouring, and gardens of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees growing out of single roots or otherwise: watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who understand! And in the Earth are neighbouring tracts, vineyards and ploughed lands, and date-palms, like and unlike, which are watered with one water. And we have made some of them to excel others in fruit. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who have sense. And in the earth there are tracts side by side and gardens of grapes and corn and palm trees having one root and others having distinct roots they are watered with one water, and We make some of them excel others in fruit; most surely there are signs in this for a people who understand.

If thou dost marvel at their want of faith, strange is their saying: "When we are actually dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes of servitude: they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein for aye! And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their saying: When we are dust, are we then forsooth to be raised in a new creation? Such are they who disbelieve in their Lord; such have carcans on their necks; such are rightful owners of the Fire, they will abide therein. And if you would wonder, then wondrous is their saying: What! when we are dust, shall we then certainly be in a new creation? These are they who disbelieve in their Lord, and these have chains on their necks, and they are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.

They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to pass, before them, many exemplary punishments! But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is also strict in punishment. And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good, when exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them. But lo! thy Lord is rich in pardon for mankind despite their wrong, and lo! thy Lord is strong in punishment. And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good, and indeed there have been exemplary punishments before them; and most surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness to people, notwithstanding their injustice; and most surely your Lord is severe in requiting evil.

And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide. Those who disbelieve say: If only some portent were sent down upon him from his Lord! Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide. And those who disbelieve say: Why has not a sign been sent down upon him from his Lord? You are only a warner and there is a guide for every people.

God doth know what every female womb doth bear, by how much the wombs fall short of their time or number or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight, in due proportion. God knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured. God knows what every female bears, and that of which the wombs fall short of completion and that in which they increase; and there is a measure with Him of everything.

He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is the Great, the Most High. He is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Great, the High Exalted. The knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Most High.

It is the same to Him whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day. Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad, he who lurketh in the night and he who goeth freely in the daytime. Alike to Him among you is he who conceals his words and he who speaks them openly, and he who hides himself by night and who goes forth by day.

For each such person there are angels in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by command of God. God does not change a people's lot unless they change what is in their hearts. But when once God willeth a people's punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect. For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by God's command. Lo! God changeth not the condition of a folk until they first change that which is in their hearts; and if God willeth misfortune for a folk there is none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him. For his sake there are angels following one another, before him and behind him, who guard him by God's commandment; surely God does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when God intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector.

It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with fertilising rain! He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the heavy clouds. He it is Who shows you the lightning causing fear and hope and Who brings up the heavy cloud.

Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will. Yet these are the men who dare to dispute about God, with the strength of His power supreme! The thunder hymneth His praise and so do the angels for awe of Him. He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute in doubt concerning God, and He is mighty in wrath. And the thunder declares His glory with His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him; and He sends the thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases, yet they dispute concerning God, and He is mighty in prowess.

For Him alone is prayer in Truth: any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but futile wandering in the mind. Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom the""Most certainly be questioned about that which you forged. And they assign daughters for God! - Glory be to Him! - and for themselves (sons, the issue) they desire! When news is brought to one of them, of the birth of a female child, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief! With shame does he hide himself from his people, because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain it on sufferance and contempt, or bury it in the dust? Ah! what an evil choice they decide on! To those who believe not in the Hereafter, applies the similitude of evil: to God applies the highest similitude: for He is the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. If God were to punish men for their wrong-doing, He would not leave, on the earth, a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: When their Term expires, they would not be able to delay the punishment for a single hour, just as they would not be able to anticipate it for a single hour. They attribute to God what they hate for themselves, and their tongues assert the falsehood that all good things are for themselves: without doubt for them is the Fire, and they will be the first to be hastened on into it! By God, We also sent Our messengers to Peoples before thee; but Satan made, to the wicked, their own acts seem alluring: He is also their patron today, but they shall have a most grievous penalty. And We sent down the Book to thee for the express purpose, that thou shouldst make clear to them those things in which they differ, and that it should be a guide and a mercy to those who believe. And God sends down rain from the skies, and gives therewith life to the earth after its death: verily in this is a Sign for those who listen. And verily in cattle too will ye find an instructive sign. From what is within their bodies between excretions and blood, We produce, for your drink, milk, pure and agreeable to those who drink it. And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out wholesome drink and food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise. And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in men's habitations; Then to eat of all the produce of the earth, and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought. It is God who creates you and takes your souls at death; and of you there are some who are sent back to a feeble age, so that they know nothing after having known much: for God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful. God has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others: those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so as to be equal in that respect. Will they then deny the favours of God? And God has made for you mates and companions of your own nature, and made for you, out of them, sons and daughters and grandchildren, and provided for you sustenance of the best: will they then believe in vain things, and be ungrateful for God's favours? And worship others than God, such as have no power of providing them, for sustenance, with anything in heavens or earth, and cannot possibly have such power? Invent not similitudes for God: for God knoweth, and ye know not. God sets forth the Parable of two men: one a slave under the dominion of another; He has no power of any sort; and the other a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favours from Ourselves, and he spends thereof freely, privately and publicly: are the two equal? Praise be to God. But most of them understand not."God sets forth a parable of two men: one of them dumb, with no power of any sort; a burden to his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal with one who commands justice and is on a straight path? To God belongs the mystery of the heavens and the earth. The decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is as the twinkling of an eye, or even quicker: for God has power over all things. It is He who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when you knew nothing; and He gave you hearing, sight, intelligence, and affections: that you may give thanks to God. Do they not look at the birds, held poised in the midst of the air and sky? Nothing holds them up but the power of God. Verily in this are signs for those who believe. God made your habitations homes of rest and quiet for you; and made for you, out of the skins of animals, tents for dwellings, which you find light when you travel and when you stop; and out of their wool, soft fibers, and hair, rich stuff and articles of convenience to serve you for a time. God made out of the things He created, some things to give you shade; of the hills He made some for your shelter; He made you garments to protect you from heat, and coats of mail to protect you from your mutual violence. Thus does He complete His favors on you, that you may bow to His will. If they turn away, your duty is only to preach the clear message. They recognize the favors of God; then they deny them; and most of them are ungrateful. One day We shall raise from all peoples a witness: then no excuse will be accepted from unbelievers, nor will they receive any favors. When the wrong-doers see the penalty, it will not be mitigated, nor will they receive respite. When those who gave partners to God see their "partners," they will say: "Our Lord! These are our 'partners,' those whom we used to invoke besides You." But they will throw back their word at them and say: "Indeed you are liars!" That day they shall openly show their submission to God; and all their inventions shall leave them in the lurch. Those who reject God and hinder men from the path of God - for them We will add penalty to penalty; for they used to spread mischief. One day We shall raise from all peoples a witness against them, from amongst themselves: and We shall bring you as a witness against these people. We have sent down to you the Book explaining all things, a guide, a mercy, and glad tidings to Muslims. God commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin, and He forbids all shameful deeds, injustice, and rebellion: He instructs you, that you may receive admonition. Fulfill the covenant of God when you have entered into it, and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them; indeed you have made God your surety; for God knows all that you do. Do not be like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong. Do not take your oaths to practice deception between yourselves, lest one party should be more numerous than another: for God will test you by this; and on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make clear to you the truth of that wherein you disagree. If God so willed, He could make you all one people: but He leaves straying whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases: but you shall certainly be called to account for all your actions. Do not take your oaths to practice deception between yourselves, with the result that someone's foot may slip after it was firmly placed."Do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after its stability and you taste evil for having hindered men from the Path of God, and a Mighty Wrath descends on you. Do not sell the covenant of God for a miserable price; what is with God is far better for you if you only knew. What is with you must vanish; what is with God will endure. We will certainly bestow on those who patiently persevere their reward according to the best of their actions. Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, to them We will give a new life, a life that is good and pure, and We will bestow on them their reward according to the best of their actions. When you read the Qur'an, seek God's protection from Satan the rejected one. He has no authority over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord. His authority is only over those who take him as a patron and join partners with God. When We substitute one revelation for another, they say, 'You are but a forger,' but most of them understand not. Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from your Lord in Truth, to strengthen those who believe, and as a Guide and Glad Tidings to Muslims. We know indeed that they say, 'It is a man that teaches him.' The tongue of him they wickedly point to is notably foreign, while this is Arabic, pure and clear. Those who believe not in the Signs of God, God will not guide them, and theirs will be a grievous Penalty. It is those who believe not in the Signs of God that forge falsehood; it is they who lie. Any one who, after accepting faith in God, utters Unbelief, except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith, but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from God, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty. This is because they love the life of this world better than the Hereafter, and God will not guide those who reject Faith. Those are they whose hearts, ears, and eyes God has sealed up, and they take no heed. Without doubt, in the Hereafter they will perish. But verily your Lord, to those who leave their homes after trials and persecutions, and who thereafter strive and fight for the faith and patiently persevere, your Lord, after all this, is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. One Day every soul will come up struggling for itself, and every soul will be recompensed fully for all its actions, and none will be unjustly dealt with. God sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place, yet it was ungrateful for the favors of God, so God made it taste of hunger and terror in extremes because of the evil which its people wrought. And there came to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they falsely rejected him; so the Wrath seized them even in the midst of their iniquities. So eat of the sustenance which God has provided for you, lawful and good, and be grateful for the favors of God if it is He Whom you serve. He has only forbidden you dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and any food over which the name of other than God has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Do not say for any false thing that your tongues may put forth, 'This is lawful, and this is forbidden,' so as to ascribe false things to God. For those who ascribe false things to God will never prosper."y pray beside God respond to them not at all, save as (is the response to) one who stretcheth forth his hands toward water (asking) that it may come unto his mouth, and it will never reach it. The prayer of disbelievers goeth (far) astray. To Him is due the true prayer; and those whom they pray to besides God give them no answer, but (they are) like one who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it may reach his mouth, but it will not reach it; and the prayer of the unbelievers is only in error.

Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to God (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and evenings. And unto God falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening hours. And whoever is in the heavens and the earth makes obeisance to God only, willingly and unwillingly, and their shadows too at morn and eve.

Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "(It is) God." Say: "Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?" Or do they assign to God partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: "God is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible." Say (O Muhammad): Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: God. Say: Take ye then (others) beside Him for protectors, which, even for themselves, have neither benefit nor hurt? Say: Is the blind man equal to the seer, or is darkness equal to light? Or assign they unto God partners who created the like of His creation so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them? Say: God is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Almighty. Say: Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: God. Say: Do you take then besides Him guardians who do not control any profit or harm for themselves? Say: Are the blind and the seeing alike? Or can the darkness and the light be equal? Or have they set up with God associates who have created creation like His, so that what is created became confused to them? Say: God is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.

He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth God (by parables) show forth Truth and Vanity. For the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth God set forth parables. He sendeth down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their measure, and the flood beareth (on its surface) swelling foam - from that which they smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like unto it - thus God coineth (the similitude of) the true and the false. Then, as for the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the banks, while, as for that which is of use to mankind, it remaineth in the earth. Thus God coineth the similitudes. He sends down water from the cloud, then watercourses flow (with water) according to their measure, and the torrent bears along the swelling foam, and from what they melt in the fire for the sake of making ornaments or apparatus arises a scum like it; thus does God compare truth and falsehood; then as for the scum, it passes away as a worthless thing; and as for that which profits the people, it tarries in the earth; thus does God set forth parables.

For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery! For those who answered God's call is bliss; and for those who answered not His call, if they had all that is in the earth, and therewith the like thereof, they would proffer it as ransom. Such will have a woeful reckoning, and their habitation will be hell, a dire abode. For those who respond to their Lord is good; and (as for) those who do not respond to Him, had they all that is in the earth and the like thereof with it they would certainly offer it for a ransom. (As for) those, an evil reckoning shall be theirs and their abode is hell, and evil is the resting-place.

Is then one who doth know that that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, like one who is blind? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition; Is he who knoweth that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth like him who is blind? But only men of understanding heed; Is he then who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth like him who is blind? Only those possessed of understanding will mind,

Those who fulfil the covenant of God and fail not in their plighted word; Such as keep the pact of God, and break not the covenant; Those who fulfil the promise of God and do not break the covenant,

Those who join together those things which God hath commanded to be joined, hold their Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning; Such as unite that which God hath commandeth should be joined, and fear their Lord, and dread a woeful reckoning; And those who join that which God has bidden to be joined and have awe of their Lord and fear the evil reckoning.

Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; Establish regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts) We have bestowed for their sustenance, secretly and openly; and turn off Evil with good: for such there is the final attainment of the (eternal) home,- Such as persevere in seeking their Lord's Countenance and are regular in prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and openly, and overcome evil with good. Theirs will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home, And those who are constant, seeking the pleasure of their Lord, and keep up prayer and spend (benevolently) out of what We have given them secretly and openly and repel evil with good; as for those, they shall have the (happy) issue of the abode,

Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate (with the salutation): Gardens of Eden which they enter, along with all who do right of their fathers and their helpmeets and their seed. The angels enter unto them from every gate, The gardens of perpetual abode which they will enter along with those who do good from among their parents and their spouses and their offspring; and the angels will enter in upon them from every gate:

"Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how excellent is the final home!" (Saying): Peace be unto you because ye persevered. Ah, passing sweet will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home. Peace be on you because you were constant, how excellent, is then, the issue of the abode.

But those who break the Covenant of God, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which God has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home! And those who break the covenant of God after ratifying it, and sever that which God hath commanded should be joined, and make mischief in the earth: theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode. And those who break the covenant of God after its confirmation and cut asunder that which God has ordered to be joined and make mischief in the land; (as for) those, upon them shall be curse and they shall have the evil (issue) of the abode.

God doth enlarge, or grant by (strict) measure, the sustenance (which He giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The wordly) rejoice in the life of this world: But the life of this world is but little comfort in the Hereafter. God enlargeth livelihood for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He will); and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of the world is but brief comfort as compared with the Hereafter. God amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases; and they rejoice in this world's life, and this world's life is nothing compared with the hereafter but a temporary enjoyment.

The Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Truly God leaveth, to stray, whom He will; But He guideth to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence," Those who disbelieve say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord! Say: Lo! God sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth unto Himself all who turn (unto Him), And those who disbelieve say: Why is not a sign sent down upon him by his Lord? Say: Surely God makes him who will go astray, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).

"Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of God: for without doubt in the remembrance of God do hearts find satisfaction." Who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of God. Verily in the remembrance of God do hearts find rest! Those who believe and whose hearts are set at rest by the remembrance of God; now surely by God's remembrance are the hearts set at rest.

"For those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a beautiful place of (final) return." Those who believe and do right: Joy is for them, and bliss (their) journey's end. (As for) those who believe and do good, a good final state shall be theirs and a goodly return.

Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other) Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what We send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most Gracious! Say: "He is my Lord! There is no god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I turn!" Thus We send thee (O Muhammad) unto a nation, before whom other nations have passed away, that thou mayst recite unto them that which We have inspired in thee, while they are disbelievers in the Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord; there is no God save Him. In Him do I put my trust and unto Him is my recourse. And thus We have sent you among a nation before which other nations have passed away, that you might recite to them what We have revealed to you and (still) they deny the Beneficent God. Say: He is my Lord, there is no god but He; on Him do I rely and to Him is my return.

If there were a Qur'an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the command is with God in all things! Do not the Believers know, that, had God (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of God come to pass, for, verily, God will not fail in His promise.

Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the unbelievers, and finally I punished them: Then how (terrible) was my requital!

Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to God. Say: "But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?" Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom God leaves to stray, no one can guide.

For them is a penalty in the life of this world, but harder, truly, is the penalty of the Hereafter: and defender have they none against God.

The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised!- beneath it flow rivers: perpetual is the enjoyment thereof and the shade therein: such is the end of the Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers in the Fire.

Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed unto thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: "I am commanded to worship God, and not to join partners with Him. Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my return."

Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Wert thou to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither protector nor defender against God.

We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of a messenger to bring a sign except as God permitted (or commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed).

God doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book.

Whether We shall show thee (within thy life-time) part of what we promised them or take to ourselves thy soul (before it is all accomplished),- thy duty is to make (the Message) reach them: it is our part to call them to account.

See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? (Where) God commands, there is none to put back His Command: and He is swift in calling to account.

Those before them did (also) devise plots; but in all things the master-planning is God's He knoweth the doings of every soul: and soon will the Unbelievers know who gets home in the end.

The Unbelievers say: "No messenger art thou." Say: "Enough for a witness between me and you is God, and such as have knowledge of the Book."

Chapter 14: IBRAHIM (ABRAHAM)
Total Verses: 52
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. R. A Book which We have revealed unto thee, in order that thou mightest lead mankind out of the depths of darkness into light - by the leave of their Lord - to the Way of (Him) the Exalted in power, worthy of all praise!

Of God, to Whom do belong all things in the heavens and on earth! But alas for the Unbelievers for a terrible penalty (their Unfaith will bring them)!

Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, who hinder (men) from the Path of God and seek therein something crooked: they are astray by a long distance.is world's life more than the hereafter, and turn away from God's path and desire to make it crooked; these are in a great error. We sent not a messenger except in the language of his people, to make things clear to them. God leaves straying those whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases; He is Exalted in power, full of Wisdom. We sent Moses with Our signs, saying: "Bring out your people from darkness into light, and remind them of the Days of God." There are Signs for those who are patient and grateful. Moses said to his people: "Remember God's favor when He delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who subjected you to severe torment, slaughtered your sons, and spared your women; this was a tremendous trial from your Lord." Your Lord proclaimed: "If you are grateful, I will give you more; but if you are thankless, My punishment is dire." Moses said: "If you are ungrateful, you and all on earth together, God is free of all wants, worthy of all praise." Has not the story reached you of those before you, of the people of Noah, 'Ad, and Thamud? Their messengers came with clear signs, but they denied and doubted. Their messengers said: "Is there a doubt about God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He invites you to forgive your sins and give you respite." They said: "You are human like us, you wish to turn us away from our gods; bring us clear authority." Their messengers said: "We are human like you, but God grants His grace to whom He pleases. It is not for us to bring authority except by God's permission. In God let believers put their trust." They said: "We shall bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us. For those who put their trust should put their trust in God." The Unbelievers said to their messengers: "We shall drive you out of our land, or you shall return to our religion." Their Lord inspired them: "We shall cause the wrong-doers to perish and make you dwell in the land after them. This is for those who fear My Majesty and My threats." They sought victory and decision, and frustration was the lot of every powerful obstinate transgressor. In front of such a one is Hell, and he is given boiling fetid water to drink. He will sip it but never swallow it; death will come to him from every quarter, yet he will not die; and in front of him will be unrelenting chastisement. The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes, blown furiously by the wind on a tempestuous day. They have no control over what they have earned; this is the extreme failure. Do you not see that God created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He can remove you and bring a new creation; this is not difficult for God. They will all be marshalled before God together: then the weak will say to the arrogant, "We followed you; can you avail us against the wrath of God?" They will reply, "If we had received the Guidance of God, we would have guided you. Whether we rage or bear these torments with patience, there is no escape for us.""In such falsehood is but a paltry profit; but they will have a most grievous Penalty. A brief enjoyment will be theirs; and theirs a painful doom. To the Jews, We prohibited such things as We have mentioned before: We did them no wrong, but they were used to doing wrong to themselves. And unto those who are Jews, We have forbidden that which We have already related unto thee. And We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong themselves. But verily thy Lord, to those who do wrong in ignorance, but who thereafter repent and make amends, thy Lord, after all this, is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Then lo! thy Lord, for those who do evil in ignorance and afterward repent and amend, lo! for them, thy Lord is afterward indeed Forgiving, Merciful. Abraham was indeed a model, devoutly obedient to God, and true in Faith, and he joined not gods with God. Lo! Abraham was a nation obedient to God, by nature upright, and he was not of the idolaters. Surely Ibrahim was an exemplar, obedient to God, upright, and he was not of the polytheists. He showed his gratitude for the favors of God, who chose him, and guided him to a Straight Way. Thankful for His bounties; He chose him and He guided him unto a straight path. Grateful for His favors; He chose him and guided him on the right path. And We gave him Good in this world, and he will be, in the Hereafter, in the ranks of the Righteous. And We gave him good in the world, and in the Hereafter he is among the righteous. And We gave him good in this world, and in the next he will most surely be among the good. So We have taught thee the inspired Message, 'Follow the ways of Abraham the True in Faith, and he joined not gods with God.' And afterward We inspired thee, Muhammad, saying: Follow the religion of Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters. Then We revealed to you: Follow the faith of Ibrahim, the upright one, and he was not of the polytheists. The Sabbath was only made strict for those who disagreed as to its observance; But God will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, as to their differences. The Sabbath was appointed only for those who differed concerning it, and lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ. The Sabbath was ordained only for those who differed about it, and most surely your Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that about which they differed. Invite all to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lord knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance. Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation, and reason with them in the better way. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is Best Aware of those who go aright. Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and have disputations with them in the best manner; surely your Lord best knows those who go astray from His path, and He knows best those who follow the right way. And if ye do catch them out, catch them out no worse than they catch you out: But if ye show patience, that is indeed the best course for those who are patient. If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted. But if ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient. And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you are patient, it will certainly be best for those who are patient. And do thou be patient, for thy patience is but from God; nor grieve over them: and distress not thyself because of their plots. Endure thou patiently, O Muhammad. Thine endurance is only by the help of God. Grieve not for them, and be not in distress because of that which they devise. And be patient and your patience is not but by the assistance of God, and grieve not for them, and do not distress yourself at what they plan. For God is with those who restrain themselves, and those who do good. Lo! God is with those who keep their duty unto Him and those who are doers of good. Surely God is with those who guard against evil and those who do good to others. Glory to God Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless, in order that We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth and seeth all things. Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place of Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighborhood whereof We have blessed, that We might show him of Our tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer. Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have blessed the precincts, so that We may show to him some of Our signs; surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing. We gave Moses the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of Israel, commanding: 'Take not other than Me as Disposer of your affairs.' We gave unto Moses the Scripture, and We appointed it a guidance for the children of Israel, saying: Choose no guardian beside Me. And We gave Musa the Book and made it a guidance to the children of Israel, saying: Do not take a protector besides Me. O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried in the Ark with Noah! Verily he was a devotee most grateful. They were the seed of those whom We carried in the ship along with Noah. Lo! he was a grateful slave. The offspring of those whom We bore with Nuh; surely he was a grateful servant. And We gave Clear Warning to the Children of Israel in the Book, that twice would they do mischief on the earth and be elated with mighty arrogance and twice would they be punished! And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: Ye verily will work corruption in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants. And We had made known to the children of Israel in the Book: Most certainly you will make mischief in the land twice, and most certainly you will behave insolently with great insolence. When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you Our servants given to terrible warfare: They entered the very inmost parts of your homes; and it was a warning completely fulfilled. So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves of Ours of great might who ravaged your country, and it was a threat performed. So when the promise for the first of the two came, We sent over you Our servants, of mighty prowess, so they went to and fro among the houses, and it was a promise to be accomplished. Then did We grant you the Return as against them: We gave you increase in resources and sons, and made you the more numerous in man-power. Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery. Then We gave you back the turn to prevail against them, and aided you with wealth and children and made you a numerous band. If ye did well, ye did well for yourselves; if ye did evil, ye did it against yourselves. So when the second of the warnings came to pass, We permitted your enemies to disfigure your faces, and to enter your Temple as they had entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that fell into their power. If ye do good, ye do good for your own souls, and if ye do evil, it is for them in like manner. So, when the time for the second of the judgments came, We roused against you others of Our slaves to ravage you, and to enter the Temple even as they entered it the first time, and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting. If you do good, you will do good for your own souls, and if you do evil, it shall be for them. So when the second promise came, We raised another people that they may bring you to grief and that they may enter the mosque as they entered it the first time, and that they might destroy whatever they gained ascendancy over with utter destruction. It may be that your Lord may yet show Mercy unto you; but if ye revert to your sins, We shall revert to Our punishments: And we have made Hell a prison for those who reject all Faith. It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, but if ye repeat the crime, We shall repeat the punishment, and We have appointed hell a dungeon for the disbelievers. It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, and if you again return to disobedience, We too will return to punishment, and We have made hell a prison for the unbelievers. Verily this Qur'an doth guide to that which is most right or stable, and giveth the Glad Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they shall have a magnificent reward. Lo! this Qur'an guideth unto that which is straightest, and giveth tidings unto the believers who do good works that theirs will be a great reward. Surely this Quran guides to that which is most upright and gives good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a great reward. And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, it announceth that We have prepared for them a Penalty Grievous indeed. And that those who believe not in the Hereafter, for them We have prepared a painful doom. And that as for those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have prepared for them a painful chastisement. The prayer that man should make for good, he maketh for evil; for man is given to hasty deeds. Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good; for man was ever hasty. And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good, and man is ever hasty. We have made the Night and the Day as two of Our Signs: the Sign of the Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the number and count of the years.""ly endure is (now) all one for us; we have no place of refuge. And they shall all come forth before God, then the weak shall say to those who were proud: Surely we were your followers, can you therefore avert from us any part of the chastisement of God? They would say: If God had guided us, we too would have guided you; it is the same to us whether we are impatient (now) or patient, there is no place for us to fly to.

And Satan will say when the matter is decided: "It was God Who gave you a promise of Truth: I too promised, but I failed in my promise to you. I had no authority over you except to call you but you listened to me: then reproach not me, but reproach your own souls. I cannot listen to your cries, nor can you listen to mine. I reject your former act in associating me with God. For wrong-doers there must be a grievous penalty."

But those who believe and work righteousness will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever with the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: "Peace!"

Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? - A goodly word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord. So God sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition.

And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree: It is torn up by the root from the surface of the earth: it has no stability. God will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but God will leave, to stray, those who do wrong: God does what He wills.

Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who have changed the favor of God into blasphemy and caused their people to descend to the House of Perdition? Into Hell? They will burn therein, an evil place to stay in! And they set up idols as equal to God, to mislead men from the Path! Say: "Enjoy your brief power! But verily you are making straightway for Hell!"

Speak to my servants who have believed, that they may establish regular prayers, and spend in charity out of the sustenance we have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day in which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.

It is God Who has created the heavens and the earth and sends down rain from the skies, and with it brings out fruits to feed you; it is He Who has made the ships subject to you, that they may sail through the sea by His command; and the rivers also He has made subject to you. And He has made subject to you the sun and the moon, both diligently pursuing their courses; and the night and the day He has also made subject to you. And He gives you of all that you ask for. But if you count the favors of God, never will you be able to number them. Verily, man is given up to injustice and ingratitude.

Remember Abraham said: "O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols. O my Lord! they have indeed led astray many among mankind; He then who follows my ways is of me, and he that disobeys me, but Thou art indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks."

O our Lord! truly Thou dost know what we conceal and what we reveal: for nothing whatever is hidden from God, whether on earth or in heaven. Praise be to God, Who has granted unto me in old age Isma'il and Isaac: for truly my Lord is He, the Hearer of Prayer! O my Lord! make me one who establishes regular Prayer, and also raise such among my offspring. O our Lord! and accept Thou my Prayer. O our Lord! cover us with Thy Forgiveness - me, my parents, and all Believers, on the Day that the Reckoning will be established!"We explained in detail. And We appoint the night and the day as two signs. Then We make dark the sign of the night, and We make the sign of the day sight-giving, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the computation of the years, and the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with clear explanation.

Every man's fate We have fastened on his own neck: On the Day of Judgment We shall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread open. (It will be said to him:) "Read your record: Sufficient is your soul this day to make out an account against you." Whoever receives guidance, receives it for his own benefit: whoever goes astray does so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent a messenger (to give warning).

When We decide to destroy a population, We first send a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress; so that the word is proved true against them: then We destroy them utterly. How many generations have We destroyed after Noah? and enough is your Lord to note and see the sins of His servants.

If any do wish for the transitory things of this life, We readily grant them such things as We will, to such person as We will: in the end, We have provided Hell for them: they will burn therein, disgraced and rejected. Those who do wish for the Hereafter, and strive for it with all due striving, and have Faith, they are the ones whose striving is acceptable to God. Of the bounties of your Lord, We bestow freely on all—these as well as those: The bounties of your Lord are not closed to anyone.

See how We have bestowed more on some than on others; but verily the Hereafter is more in rank and gradation and more in excellence. Take not with God another object of worship; or you will sit in disgrace and destitution. Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor. And lower to them the wing of humility, and say: "My Lord! bestow on them Your Mercy even as they cherished me in childhood."

Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts: If you do deeds of righteousness, He is Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again and again in true penitence. And render to the kindred their due rights, as also to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But squander not your wealth in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones; and the Evil One is to his Lord ungrateful.

And even if you have to turn away from them in pursuit of the Mercy from your Lord which you expect, yet speak to them a word of easy kindness. Make not your hand tied like a niggard's to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach, so that you become blameworthy and destitute. Verily your Lord provides sustenance in abundance for whom He pleases, and He provides in a just measure. For He knows and regards all His servants.

Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin. Nor come near to adultery: for it is a shameful deed and an evil, opening the road to other evils. Nor take life—which God has made sacred—except for just cause. And if anyone is slain wrongfully, We have given his heir authority to demand qisas or to forgive: but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped by the Law.

Come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength; and fulfill every engagement, for every engagement will be enquired into on the Day of Reckoning.Think not that God does not heed the deeds of those who do wrong. He gives them respite against a Day when eyes will stare in horror. They will come hurrying on in fear, their heads upraised, their gaze not returning to them, and their hearts vacant.

Warn mankind of the Day when the Wrath will reach them. The wrong-doers will say: "Our Lord! Reprieve us for a short term: we will answer Your call and follow the messengers!" It will be answered: "Did you not swear before that there would be no end for you?"

You dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it is clear how We dealt with them and made examples for you. Mighty indeed were their plots, but their plots were within the sight of God, even though they were such as to shake the hills.

Never think that God would fail His messengers in His promise. God is Exalted in power, the Lord of Retribution. One day the earth will be changed to a different earth, and so will the heavens, and men will be marshalled forth before God, the One, the Irresistible.

You will see the sinners that day bound together in fetters, their garments of liquid pitch, and their faces covered with Fire. God will requite each soul according to its deserts; God is swift in calling to account.

Here is a Message for mankind: Let them take warning and know that He is One God. Let men of understanding take heed.

Chapter 15: AL-HIJR (STONELAND, ROCK CITY)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. R. These are the Ayats of Revelation, of a Qur'an that makes things clear. Again and again will those who disbelieve wish that they had bowed to God's will in Islam. Leave them alone to enjoy the good things of this life and to please themselves; soon will knowledge undeceive them.

We did not destroy a population that had not a term decreed and assigned beforehand. Neither can a people anticipate its term nor delay it. They say: "O you to whom the Message is being revealed! Truly you are mad!" They ask: "Why do you not bring angels to us if you are truthful?"

We send not the angels down except for just cause; if they came to the ungodly, no respite would they have. We have sent down the Message and will assuredly guard it from corruption. We did send messengers before you among the religious sects of old, but never came a messenger to them without being mocked.

Even so, We let it creep into the hearts of the sinners that they should not believe in the Message. The ways of the ancients have passed away. Even if We opened a gate from heaven and they continued ascending therein, they would say: "Our eyes have been intoxicated; we have been bewitched by sorcery."

We have set out the zodiacal signs in the heavens and made them fair-seeming to all beholders. We have guarded them from every cursed devil, but any that gains a hearing by stealth is pursued by a flaming fire. The earth We have spread out like a carpet, set thereon mountains firm and immovable, and produced therein all kinds of things in due balance.

We have provided therein means of subsistence for you and for those for whose sustenance you are not responsible. There is not a thing but its sources and treasures are with Us; We only send down thereof in due and ascertainable measures. We send the fecundating winds, then cause the rain to descend from the sky, providing you with water in abundance, though you are not the guardians of its stores.Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight: that is the most fitting and advantageous in the final determination. Do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge; for every act of hearing, seeing, or feeling in the heart will be enquired into on the Day of Reckoning. Do not walk on the earth with insolence: you cannot rend the earth asunder, nor reach the mountains in height. The evil of all such things is hateful in the sight of your Lord. These are among the precepts of wisdom revealed to you. Do not take another object of worship with God, lest you be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected.

Has your Lord preferred for you sons and taken daughters among the angels? Truly, you utter a dreadful saying! We have explained things in various ways in this Qur'an, in order that they may receive admonition, but it only increases their flight from the Truth. Say: If there were other gods with Him, as they say, they would have sought a way to the Lord of the Throne. Glory to Him! He is high above all that they say, exalted and great beyond measure. The seven heavens and the earth, and all beings therein, declare His glory: there is not a thing but celebrates His praise, though you do not understand their praise. He is Oft-Forbearing, Most Forgiving.

When you recite the Qur'an, We put a veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and coverings over their hearts and deafness in their ears. When you commemorate your Lord alone in the Qur'an, they turn on their backs, fleeing from the Truth. We know best why they listen when they listen to you; and when they meet in private conference, the wicked say, "You follow none other than a man bewitched!" See what similes they strike for you: they have gone astray and cannot find a way.

They say: "What! When we are reduced to bones and dust, should we really be raised up to be a new creation?" Say: "Be you stones or iron, or any created matter which, in your minds, is hardest to be raised up, yet you shall be raised up!" Then they will say, "Who will cause us to return?" Say: "He who created you first!" Then they will wag their heads and say, "When will that be?" Say, "Maybe it will be quite soon!" It will be on a Day when He will call you, and you will answer with words of His praise, and you will think that you tarried but a little while.

Say to My servants that they should only say those things that are best: for Satan sows dissensions among them. For Satan is to man an avowed enemy. Your Lord knows you best: if He pleases, He grants you mercy, or if He pleases, punishment. We have not sent you to be a disposer of their affairs. Your Lord knows best all beings in the heavens and on earth: We bestowed on some prophets more gifts than on others, and We gave to David the Psalms. Say: "Call on those besides Him whom you fancy: they have neither the power to remove your troubles from you nor to change them."

Those whom they call upon desire means of access to their Lord, even those who are nearest: they hope for His mercy and fear His wrath. The wrath of your Lord is something to take heed of. There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful penalty: that is written in the eternal Record. We refrain from sending the signs only because the men of former generations treated them as false: We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes, but they treated her wrongfully.And We send the winds fertilizing, then send down water from the cloud so We give it to you to drink, nor is it you who store it up. And verily, it is We Who give life, and Who give death: it is We Who remain inheritors (after all else passes away). To Us are known those of you who hasten forward, and those who lag behind. Assuredly it is thy Lord Who will gather them together: for He is perfect in Wisdom and Knowledge. We created man from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape; and the jinn race, We had created before, from the fire of a scorching wind. Behold! thy Lord said to the angels: "I am about to create man, from sounding clay from mud molded into shape; when I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him." So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together, except Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves. (God) said: "O Iblis! what is your reason for not being among those who prostrated themselves?" (Iblis) said: "I am not one to prostrate myself to man, whom Thou didst create from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape." (God) said: "Then get thee out from here; for thou art rejected, accursed. And the curse shall be on thee till the day of Judgment." (Iblis) said: "O my Lord! give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised." (God) said: "Respite is granted thee till the Day of the Time appointed." (Iblis) said: "O my Lord! because Thou hast put me in the wrong, I will make (wrong) fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will put them all in the wrong, except Thy servants among them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace)." (God) said: "This (way of My sincere servants) is indeed a way that leads straight to Me. For over My servants no authority shalt thou have, except such as put themselves in the wrong and follow thee." And verily, Hell is the promised abode for them all! To it are seven gates: for each of those gates is a (special) class (of sinners) assigned. The righteous (will be) amid gardens and fountains (of clear-flowing water). (Their greeting will be): "Enter ye here in peace and security." And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury: (they will be) brothers (joyfully) facing each other on thrones (of dignity). There no sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave. Tell My servants that I am indeed the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful; and that My Penalty will be indeed the most grievous Penalty. Tell them about the guests of Abraham. When they entered his presence and said, "Peace!" He said, "We feel afraid of you!" They said: "Fear not! We give thee glad tidings of a son endowed with wisdom." He said: "Do ye give me glad tidings that old age has seized me? Of what, then, is your good news?" They said: "We give thee glad tidings in truth: be not then in despair!" He said: "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, but such as go astray?" Abraham said: "What then is the business on which ye (have come), O ye messengers (of God)?" They said: "We have been sent to a people (deep) in sin, excepting the adherents of Lut: them we are certainly (charged) to save (from harm),- All - except his wife, who, We have ascertained, will be among those who will lag behind." At length when the messengers arrived among the adherents of Lut, he said: "Ye appear to be uncommon folk." They said: "Yea, we have come to thee to accomplish that of which they doubt. We have brought to thee that which is inevitably due, and assuredly we tell the truth." "Then travel by night with thy household, when a portion of the night (yet remains), and do thou bring up the rear: let no one amongst you look back, but pass on whither ye are ordered."only send the Signs by way of terror (and warning from evil). We gave Thamud the she-camel - a clear portent save to warn. Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about: We granted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Qur'an: We put terror (and warning) into them, but it only increases their inordinate transgression! Behold! We said to the angels: "Bow down unto Adam": They bowed down except Iblis: He said, "Shall I bow down to one whom Thou didst create from clay?" He said: "Seest Thou? this is the one whom Thou hast honoured above me! If Thou wilt but respite me to the Day of Judgment, I will surely bring his descendants under my sway - all but a few!" (God) said: "Go thy way; if any of them follow thee, verily Hell will be the recompense of you (all)- an ample recompense." "Lead to destruction those whom thou canst among them, with thy (seductive) voice; make assaults on them with thy cavalry and thy infantry; mutually share with them wealth and children; and make promises to them." But Satan promises them nothing but deceit. "As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs. Your Lord is He That maketh the Ship go smoothly for you through the sea, in order that ye may seek of his Bounty. For he is unto you most Merciful. When distress seizes you at sea, those that ye call upon - besides Himself - leave you in the lurch! but when He brings you back safe to land, ye turn away (from Him). Most ungrateful is man! Do ye then feel secure that He will not cause you to be swallowed up beneath the earth when ye are on land, or that He will not send against you a violent tornado (with showers of stones) so that ye shall find no one to carry out your affairs for you? Or do ye feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea and send against you a heavy gale to drown you because of your ingratitude, so that ye find no helper. Therein against Us? We have honoured the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favours, above a great part of our creation. One day We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imams: those who are given their record in their right hand will read it (with pleasure), and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least. But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in the hereafter, and most astray from the Path. And their purpose was to tempt thee away from that which We had revealed unto thee, to substitute in our name something quite different; (in that case), behold! they would certainly have made thee (their) friend! And had We not given thee strength, thou wouldst nearly have inclined to them a little. In that case We should have made thee taste an equal portion (of punishment) in this life, and an equal portion in death: and moreover thou wouldst have found none to help thee against Us! Their purpose was to scare thee off the land, in order to expel thee; but in that case they would not have stayed (therein) after thee, except for a little while. (This was Our) way with the messengers We sent before thee: thou wilt find no change in Our ways. Establish regular prayers - at the sun's decline till the darkness of the night, and the morning prayer and reading: for the prayer and reading in the morning carry their testimony. And pray in the small watches of the morning: (it would be) an additional prayer (or spiritual profit) for thee: soon will thy Lord raise thee to a Station of Praise and Glory! Say: "O my Lord! Let my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honour, and likewiseAnd We made known this decree to him, that the last remnants of those (sinners) should be cut off by the morning. The inhabitants of the city came in joy at the news of the young men. Lut said: "These are my guests: disgrace me not." But fear God, and shame me not. They said: "Did we not forbid thee to speak for all and sundry?" He said: "There are my daughters to marry, if ye must act so." Verily, by thy life, in their wild intoxication, they wander in distraction. But the mighty Blast overtook them before morning, and We turned the cities upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay. Behold! in this are Signs for those who understand. The cities were right on the high-road. And the Companions of the Wood were also wrong-doers. So We exacted retribution from them. The Companions of the Rocky Tract also rejected the messengers. We sent them Our Signs, but they persisted in turning away from them. Out of the mountains did they hew their edifices, feeling themselves secure. But the mighty Blast seized them of a morning, and of no avail to them was all that they did. We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, but for just ends. And the Hour is surely coming. So overlook any human faults with gracious forgiveness. For verily it is thy Lord who is the Master-Creator, knowing all things. And We have bestowed upon thee the Seven oft-repeated verses and the Grand Qur'an. Strain not thine eyes at what We have bestowed on certain classes of them, nor grieve over them: but lower thy wing in gentleness to the believers. And say: "I am indeed he that warneth openly and without ambiguity," as We sent down on those who divided Scripture into arbitrary parts. Therefore, by the Lord, We will call them to account for all their deeds. Therefore expound openly what thou art commanded, and turn away from those who join false gods with God. For sufficient are We unto thee against those who scoff, those who adopt, with God, another god: but soon will they come to know. We do indeed know how thy heart is distressed at what they say. But celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and be of those who prostrate themselves in adoration. And serve thy Lord until there come unto thee the Hour that is Certain."my exit by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and grant me from Thy Presence an authority to aid (me)." And say: My Lord! Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out with a firm outgoing. And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power. And say: My Lord! make me to enter a goodly entering, and cause me to go forth a goodly going forth, and grant me from near Thee power to assist (me). And say: "Truth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish." And say: Truth hath come and falsehood hath vanished away. Lo! falsehood is ever bound to vanish. And say: The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished; surely falsehood is a vanishing (thing). We send down (stage by stage) in the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe: to the unjust it causes nothing but loss after loss. And We reveal of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy for believers though it increase the evil-doers in naught save ruin. And We reveal of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers, and it adds only to the perdition of the unjust. Yet when We bestow Our favours on man, he turns away and becomes remote on his side (instead of coming to Us), and when evil seizes him he gives himself up to despair! And when We make life pleasant unto man, he turneth away and is averse; and when ill toucheth him he is in despair. And when We bestow favor on man, he turns aside and behaves proudly, and when evil afflicts him, he is despairing. Say: "Everyone acts according to his own disposition: But your Lord knows best who it is that is best guided on the Way." Say: Each one doth according to his rule of conduct, and thy Lord is Best Aware of him whose way is right. Say: Every one acts according to his manner; but your Lord best knows who is best guided in the path. They ask thee concerning the Spirit (of inspiration). Say: "The Spirit (cometh) by command of my Lord: of knowledge it is only a little that is communicated to you, (O men!)" They are asking thee concerning the Spirit. Say: The Spirit is by command of my Lord, and of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little. And they ask you about the soul. Say: The soul is one of the commands of my Lord, and you are not given aught of knowledge but a little. If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspiration: then wouldst thou find none to plead thy affair in that matter as against Us,- And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto thee, then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against Us in respect thereof. And if We please, We should certainly take away that which We have revealed to you, then you would not find for it any protector against Us. Except for Mercy from thy Lord: for his bounty is to thee (indeed) great. (It is naught) save mercy from thy Lord. Lo! His kindness unto thee was ever great. But on account of mercy from your Lord surely His grace to you is abundant. Say: "If the whole of mankind and jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up each other with help and support." Say: Verily, though mankind and the jinn should assemble to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof though they were helpers one of another. Say: If men and jinn should combine together to bring the like of this Quran, they could not bring the like of it, though some of them were aiders of others. And We have explained to man, in this Qur'an, every kind of similitude: yet the greater part of men refuse (to receive it) except with ingratitude! And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur'an all kind of similitudes, but most of mankind refuse aught save disbelief. And certainly We have explained for men in this Quran every kind of similitude, but most men do not consent to aught but denying. They say: "We shall not believe in thee, until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth," And they say: We will not put faith in thee till thou cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us; And they say: We will by no means believe in you until you cause a fountain to gush forth from the earth for us. "Or (until) thou have a garden of date trees and vines, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst, carrying abundant water;" Or thou have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth therein abundantly; Or you should have a garden of palms and grapes in the midst of which you should cause rivers to flow forth, gushing out. "Or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces, as thou sayest (will happen), against us; or thou bring God and the angels before (us) face to face:" Or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us piecemeal, as thou hast pretended, or bring God and the angels as a warrant; Or you should cause the heaven to come down upon us in pieces as you think, or bring God and the angels face to face (with us). "Or thou have a house adorned with gold, or thou mount a ladder right into the skies. No, we shall not even believe in thy mounting until thou send down to us a book that we could read." Say: "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a man,- a messenger?" Or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend up into heaven, and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension till thou bring down for us a book that we can read. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord be Glorified! Am I aught save a mortal messenger? Or you should have a house of gold, or you should ascend into heaven, and we will not believe in your ascending until you bring down to us a book which we may read. Say: Glory be to my Lord; am I aught but a mortal messenger? What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them, was nothing but this: they said, "Has God sent a man (like us) to be (His) Messenger?" And naught prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came unto them save that they said: Hath God sent a mortal as (His) messenger? And nothing prevented people from believing when the guidance came to them except that they said: What! has God raised up a mortal to be a messenger? Say, "If there were settled, on earth, angels walking about in peace and quiet, We should certainly have sent them down from the heavens an angel for a messenger." Say: If there were in the earth angels walking secure, We had sent down for them from heaven an angel as messenger. Say: Had there been in the earth angels walking about as settlers, We would certainly have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a messenger. Say: "Enough is God for a witness between me and you: for He is well acquainted with His servants, and He sees (all things)." Say: God sufficeth for a witness between me and you. Lo! He is Knower, Seer of His slaves. Say: God suffices as a witness between me and you; surely He is Aware of His servants, Seeing. It is he whom God guides, that is on true Guidance; but he whom He leaves astray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather, them together, prone on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf: their abode will be Hell: every time it shows abatement, We shall increase from them the fierceness of the Fire. And he whom God guideth, he is led aright; while, as for him whom He sendeth astray, for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside Him, and We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their habitation will be hell; whenever it abateth, We increase the flame for them. And whomsoever God guides, he is the follower of the right way, and whomsoever He causes to err, you shall not find for him guardians besides Him; and We will gather them together on the day of resurrection on their faces, blind and dumb and deaf; their abode is hell; whenever it becomes allayed We will add to their burning. That is their recompense, because they rejected Our signs, and said, "When we are reduced to bones and broken dust, should we really be raised up (to be) a new Creation?" That is their reward because they disbelieved Our revelations and said: When we are bones and fragments shall we, forsooth, be raised up as a new creation? This is their retribution because they disbelieved in Our communications and said What! when we shall have become bones and decayed particles, shall we then indeed be raised up into a new creation? See they not that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, has power to create the like of them (anew)? Only He has decreed a term appointed, of which there is no doubt. But the unjust refuse (to receive it) except with ingratitude. Have they not seen that God Who created the heavens and the earth is Able to create the like of them, and hath appointed for them an end whereof there is no doubt? But the wrong-doers refuse aught save disbelief. Do they not consider that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create their like, and He has appointed for them a doom about which there is no doubt? But the unjust do not consent to aught but denying. Say: "If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, behold, ye would keep them back, for fear of spending them: for man is (every) niggardly!" Say (unto them): If ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, ye would surely hold them back for fear of spending, for man was ever grudging. Say: If you control the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, then you would withhold (them) from fear of spending, and man is niggardly. To Moses We did give Nine Clear Signs: As the Children of Israel: when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him: "O Moses! I consider thee, indeed, to have been worked upon by sorcery!" And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens, clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty). Do but ask the Children of Israel how he came unto them, then Pharaoh said unto him: Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses. And certainly We gave Musa nine clear signs; so ask the children of Israel. When he came to them, Firon said to him: Most surely I deem you, O Musa, to be a man deprived of reason. Moses said, "Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence: and I consider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!" He said: In truth thou knowest that none sent down these (portents) save the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs, and lo! (for my part) I deem thee lost, O Pharaoh. He said: Truly you know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these as clear proof and most surely I consider you, O Firon, to be lost.And (He made) horses and mules and asses that you might ride upon them and as an ornament; and He creates what you do not know. And unto God leads straight the Way, but there are ways that turn aside: if God had willed, He could have guided all of you. And God's is the direction of the way, and some (roads) go not straight. And had He willed He would have led you all aright. And upon God it rests to show the right way, and there are some deviating (ways); and if He please He would certainly guide you all aright. It is He who sends down rain from the sky: from it ye drink, and out of it (grows) the vegetation on which ye feed your cattle. He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky, whence ye have drink, and whence are trees on which ye send your beasts to pasture. He it is Who sends down water from the cloud for you; it gives drink, and by it (grow) the trees upon which you pasture. With it He produces for you corn, olives, date-palms, grapes and every kind of fruit: verily in this is a sign for those who give thought. Therewith He causeth crops to grow for you, and the olive and the date-palm and grapes and all kinds of fruit. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect. He causes to grow for you thereby herbage, and the olives, and the palm trees, and the grapes, and of all the fruits; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect. He has made subject to you the Night and the Day; the sun and the moon; and the stars are in subjection by His Command: verily in this are Signs for men who are wise. And He hath constrained the night and the day and the sun and the moon to be of service unto you, and the stars are made subservient by His command. Lo! herein indeed are portents for people who have sense. And He has made subservient for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and the stars are made subservient by His commandment; most surely there are signs in this for a people who ponder; And the things on this earth which He has multiplied in varying colours (and qualities): verily in this is a sign for men who celebrate the praises of God (in gratitude). And whatsoever He hath created for you in the earth of divers hues, lo! therein is indeed a portent for people who take heed. And what He has created in the earth of varied hues most surely there is a sign in this for a people who are mindful. It is He Who has made the sea subject, that ye may eat thereof flesh that is fresh and tender, and that ye may extract therefrom ornaments to wear; and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves, that ye may seek (thus) of the bounty of God and that ye may be grateful. And He it is Who hath constrained the sea to be of service that ye eat fresh meat from thence, and bring forth from thence ornaments which ye wear. And thou seest the ships ploughing it that ye (mankind) may seek of His bounty and that haply ye may give thanks. And He it is Who has made the sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth from it ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships cleaving through it, and that you might seek of His bounty and that you may give thanks. And He has set up on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; and rivers and roads; that ye may guide yourselves; And He hath cast into the earth firm hills that it quake not with you, and streams and roads that ye may find a way. And He has cast great mountains in the earth lest it might be convulsed with you, and rivers and roads that you may go aright, And marks and sign-posts; and by the stars (men) guide themselves. And landmarks (too), and by the star they find a way. And landmarks; and by the stars they find the right way. Is then He Who creates like one that creates not? Will ye not receive admonition? Is He then Who createth as him who createth not? Will ye not then remember? Is He then Who creates like him who does not create? Do you not then mind? If ye would count up the favours of God, never would ye be able to number them: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And if ye would count the favour of God ye cannot reckon it. Lo! God is indeed Forgiving, Merciful. And if you would count God's favors, you will not be able to number them; most surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. And God doth know what ye conceal, and what ye reveal. And God knoweth that which ye keep hidden and that which ye proclaim. And God knows what you conceal and what you do openly. Those whom they invoke besides God create nothing and are themselves created. Those unto whom they cry beside God created naught, but are themselves created. And those whom they call on besides God have not created anything while they are themselves created; (They are things) dead, lifeless: nor do they know when they will be raised up. (They are) dead, not living. And they know not when they will be raised. Dead (are they), not living, and they know not when they shall be raised. Your God is one God: as to those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant. Your God is One God. But as for those who believe not in the Hereafter their hearts refuse to know, for they are proud. Your God is one God; so (as for) those who do not believe in the hereafter, their hearts are ignorant and they are proud. Undoubtedly God doth know what they conceal, and what they reveal: verily He loveth not the arrogant. Assuredly God knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim. Lo! He loveth not the proud. Truly God knows what they hide and what they manifest; surely He does not love the proud. When it is said to them, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "Tales of the ancients!" And when it is said unto them: What hath your Lord revealed? they say: (Mere) fables of the men of old, And when it is said to them, what is it that your Lord has revealed? They say: Stories of the ancients; Let them bear, on the Day of Judgment, their own burdens in full, and also (something) of the burdens of those without knowledge, whom they misled. Alas, how grievous the burdens they will bear! That they may bear their burdens undiminished on the Day of Resurrection, with somewhat of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge. Ah! evil is that which they bear! That they may bear their burdens entirely on the day of resurrection and also of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without knowledge; now surely evil is what they bear. Those before them did also plot (against God's Way): but God took their structures from their foundations, and the roof fell down on them from above; and the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive. Those before them plotted, so God struck at the foundations of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the doom came on them whence they knew not; Those before them did indeed devise plans, but God demolished their building from the foundations, so the roof fell down on them from above them, and the punishment came to them from whence they did not perceive. Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will cover them with shame, and say: "Where are My 'partners' concerning whom ye used to dispute (with the godly)?" Those endued with knowledge will say: "This Day, indeed, are the Unbelievers covered with shame and misery,-" Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say: Where are My partners, for whose sake ye opposed (My guidance)? Those who have been given knowledge will say: Disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers, Then on the resurrection day He will bring them to disgrace and say: Where are the associates you gave Me, for whose sake you became hostile? Those who are given the knowledge will say: Surely the disgrace and the evil are this day upon the unbelievers: "(Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrong-doing to their own souls." Then would they offer submission (with the pretence), "We did no evil (knowingly)." (The angels will reply), "Nay, but verily God knoweth all that ye did;" Whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging themselves. Then will they make full submission (saying): We used not to do any wrong. Nay! Surely God is Knower of what ye used to do. Those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to themselves. Then would they offer submission: We used not to do any evil. Aye! surely God knows what you did. "So enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein. Thus evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant." So enter the gates of hell, to dwell therein for ever. Woeful indeed will be the lodging of the arrogant. Therefore enter the gates of hell, to abide therein; so certainly evil is the dwelling place of the proud. To the righteous (when) it is said, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "All that is good." To those who do good, there is good in this world, and the Home of the Hereafter is even better and excellent indeed is the Home of the righteous,- And it is said unto those who ward off (evil): What hath your Lord revealed? They say: Good. For those who do good in this world there is a good (reward) and the home of the Hereafter will be better. Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off (evil) - And it is said to those who guard (against evil): What is it that your Lord has revealed? They say, Good. For those who do good in this world is good, and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better; and certainly most excellent is the abode of those who guard (against evil); Gardens of Eternity which they will enter: beneath them flow (pleasant) rivers: they will have therein all that they wish: thus doth God reward the righteous,- Gardens of Eden which they enter, underneath which rivers flow, wherein they have what they will. Thus God repayeth those who ward off (evil), The gardens of perpetuity, they shall enter them, rivers flowing beneath them; they shall have in them what they please. Thus does God reward those who guard (against evil), (Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity, saying (to them), "Peace be on you; enter ye the Garden, because of (the good) which ye did (in the world)." Those whom the angels cause to die (when they are) good. They say: Peace be unto you! Enter the Garden because of what ye used to do. Those whom the angels cause to die in a good state, saying: Peace be on you: enter the garden for what you did. Do the (ungodly) wait until the angels come to them, or there cSo he desired to destroy them out of the earth, but We drowned him and those with him all together. And We said to the Israelites after him: Dwell in the land: and when the promise of the next life shall come to pass, we will bring you both together in judgment. We sent down the Qur'an in Truth, and in Truth has it descended: and We sent thee but to give Glad Tidings and to warn (sinners). And it is a Qur'an which We have revealed in portions so that you may read it to the people by slow degrees, and We have revealed it, revealing in portions. Say: Believe in it or believe not; surely those who are given the knowledge before it fall down on their faces, making obeisance when it is recited to them. And they say: Glory be to our Lord! most surely the promise of our Lord was to be fulfilled. And they fall down on their faces weeping, and it adds to their humility. Say: Call upon God or call upon the Beneficent God; whichever you call upon, He has the best names; and do not utter your prayer with a very raised voice nor be silent with regard to it, and seek a way between these. And say: (All) praise is due to God, Who has not taken a son and Who has not a partner in the kingdom, and Who has not a helper to save Him from disgrace; and proclaim His greatness magnifying (Him). 

Chapter 18: AL-KAHF (THE CAVE)
Total Verses: 110
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, Who revealed the Book to His servant and did not make in it any crookedness. Rightly directing, that he might give warning of severe punishment from Him and give good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a goodly reward, staying in it forever. And warn those who say: God has taken a son. They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers; a grievous word it is that comes out of their mouths; they speak nothing but a lie. Then maybe you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them, if they do not believe in this announcement. Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment for it, so that We may try them (as to) which of them is best in works. And most surely We will make what is on it bare ground without herbage. Or, do you think that the Fellows of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our wonderful signs? When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they said: Our Lord! grant us mercy from Thee, and provide for us a right course in our affair. So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years. Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties was best able to compute the time for which they remained. We relate to you their story with the truth; surely they were youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance. And We strengthened their hearts with patience, when they stood up and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will by no means call upon any god besides Him, for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing. These our people have taken gods besides Him; why do they not produce any clear authority in their support? Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against God? And when you forsake them and what they worship save God, betake yourselves for refuge to the cave; your Lord will extend to you largely of His mercy and provide for you a profitable course in your affair."omes the Command of thy Lord (for their doom)? So did those who went before them. But God wronged them not: nay, they wronged their own souls. Await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy Lord's command should come to pass? Even so did those before them. God wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves. But the evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that very (Wrath) at which they had scoffed hemmed them in. So that the evils of what they did smote them, and that which they used to mock surrounded them. The worshippers of false gods say: "If God had so willed, we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers,- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His." So did those who went before them. But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message? And the idolaters say: Had God willed, we had not worshipped aught beside Him, we and our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught without (command from) Him. Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged with aught save plain conveyance (of the message)? And they who give associates (to God) say: If God had pleased, we would not have served anything besides God, (neither) we nor our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything without (order from) Him. Thus did those before them; is then aught incumbent upon the messengers except a plain delivery (of the message)? For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, (with the Command), "Serve God, and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom God guided, and some on whom error became inevitably (established). So travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who denied (the Truth). And verily We have raised in every nation a messenger, (proclaiming): Serve God and shun false gods. Then some of them (there were) whom God guided, and some of them (there were) upon whom error had just hold. Do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers! And certainly We raised in every nation a messenger saying: Serve God and shun the Shaitan. So there were some of them whom God guided and there were others against whom error was due; therefore travel in the land, then see what was the end of the rejecters. If thou art anxious for their guidance, yet God guideth not such as He leaves to stray, and there is none to help them. Even if thou (O Muhammad) desirest their right guidance, still God assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth. Such have no helpers. If you desire for their guidance, yet surely God does not guide him who leads astray, nor shall they have any helpers. They swear their strongest oaths by God, that God will not raise up those who die: Nay, but it is a promise (binding) on Him in truth: but most among mankind realise it not. And they swear by God their most binding oaths (that) God will not raise up him who dieth. Nay, but it is a promise (binding) upon Him in truth, but most of mankind know not, And they swear by God with the most energetic of their oaths: God will not raise up him who dies. Yea! it is a promise binding on Him, quite true, but most people do not know; (They must be raised up), in order that He may manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ, and that the rejecters of Truth may realise that they had indeed (surrendered to) Falsehood. That He may explain unto them that wherein they differ, and that those who disbelieved may know that they were liars. So that He might make manifest to them that about which they differ, and that those who disbelieve might know that they were liars. For to anything which We have willed, We but say the word, "Be", and it is. And Our word unto a thing, when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: Be! and it is. Our word for a thing when We intend it, is only that We say to it, Be, and it is. To those who leave their homes in the cause of God, after suffering oppression,- We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world; but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater. If they only realised (this)! And those who became fugitives for the cause of God after they had been oppressed, We verily shall give them goodly lodging in the world, and surely the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they but knew; And those who fly for God's sake after they are oppressed, We will most certainly give them a good abode in the world, and the reward of the hereafter is certainly much greater, did they but know; (They are) those who persevere in patience, and put their trust on their Lord. Such as are steadfast and put their trust in God. Those who are patient and on their Lord do they rely. And before thee also the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We granted inspiration: if ye realise this not, ask of those who possess the Message. And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men whom We inspired - Ask the followers of the Remembrance if ye know not! And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation so ask the followers of the Reminder if you do not know. (We sent them) with Clear Signs and Books of dark prophecies; and We have sent down unto thee (also) the Message; that thou mayest explain clearly to men what is sent for them, and that they may give thought. With clear proofs and writings; and We have revealed unto thee the Remembrance that thou mayst explain to mankind that which hath been revealed for them, and that haply they may reflect. With clear arguments and scriptures; and We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to men what has been revealed to them, and that haply they may reflect. Do then those who devise evil (plots) feel secure that God will not cause the earth to swallow them up, or that the Wrath will not seize them from directions they little perceive? Are they who plan ill-deeds then secure that God will not cause the earth to swallow them, or that the doom will not come on them whence they know not? Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that God will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not perceive? Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to and fro, without a chance of their frustrating Him? Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro so that there be no escape for them? Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journeys, then shall they not escape; Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - for thy Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy. Or that He will not seize them with a gradual wasting? Lo! thy Lord is indeed Full of Pity, Merciful. Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss, for your Lord is most surely Compassionate, Merciful. Do they not look at God's creation, (even) among (inanimate) things,- How their (very) shadows turn round, from the right and the left, prostrating themselves to God, and that in the humblest manner? Have they not observed all things that God hath created, how their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto God, and they are lowly? Do they not consider every thing that God has created? Its (very) shadows return from right and left, making obeisance to God while they are in utter abasement. And to God doth obeisance all that is in the heavens and on earth, whether moving (living) creatures or the angels: for none are arrogant (before their Lord). And unto God maketh prostration whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth of living creatures, and the angels (also) and they are not proud. And whatever creature that is in the heavens and that is in the earth makes obeisance to God (only), and the angels (too) and they do not show pride. They all revere their Lord, high above them, and they do all that they are commanded. They fear their Lord above them, and do what they are bidden. They fear their Lord above them and do what they are commanded. God has said: "Take not (for worship) two gods: for He is just One God: then fear Me (and Me alone)." God hath said: Choose not two gods. There is only One God. So of Me, Me only, be in awe. And God has said: Take not two gods, He is only one God; so of Me alone should you be afraid. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth, and to Him is duty due always: then will ye fear other than God? Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and religion is His for ever. Will ye then fear any other than God? And whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His, and to Him should obedience be (rendered) constantly; will you then guard against other than (the punishment of) God? And ye have no good thing but is from God: and moreover, when ye are touched by distress, unto Him ye cry with groans; And whatever of comfort ye enjoy, it is from God. Then, when misfortune reacheth you, unto Him ye cry for help. And whatever favor is (bestowed) on you it is from God; then when evil afflicts you, to Him do you cry for aid. Yet, when He removes the distress from you, behold! some of you turn to other gods to join with their Lord- And afterward, when He hath rid you of the misfortune, behold! a set of you attribute partners to their Lord, Yet when He removes the evil from you, lo! a party of you associate others with their Lord; (As if) to show their ingratitude for the favours we have bestowed on them! then enjoy (your brief day): but soon will ye know (your folly)! So as to deny that which We have given them. Then enjoy life (while ye may), for ye will come to know. So that they be ungrateful for what We have given them; then enjoy yourselves; for soon will you know. And they (even) assign, to things they do not know, a portion out of that which We have bestowed for their sustenance! By God, ye shall certainly be called to account for your false inventions. And they assign a portion of that which We have given them unto what they know not. By God! but ye will indeed be asked concerning (all) that ye used to invent. And they set apart for what they do not know a portion of what We have given them. By God, you shall"This will contain the original content of the document, unchanged just edited to be more readable and AI friendly.

He whom God guides is rightly guided; but he whom God leaves to stray, for him you will find no protector to lead him to the Right Way. You might have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft thereof. That was one of the portents of God. He whom God guides is led aright, and he whom He sends astray, for him you will not find a guiding friend. You might see the sun when it rose, decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set, leave them behind on the left while they were in a wide space thereof. This is of the signs of God; whomsoever God guides, he is the rightly guided one, and whomsoever He causes to err, you shall not find for him any friend to lead him aright.

You would have deemed them awake, while they were asleep, and We turned them on their right and on their left sides: their dog stretching forth his two fore-legs on the threshold: if you had come upon them, you would have certainly turned back from them in flight, and would have certainly been filled with terror of them. You would have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and We caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his paws on the threshold. If you had observed them closely, you would have assuredly turned away from them in flight, and would have been filled with awe of them.

We raised them up from sleep, that they might question each other. One of them said, "How long have you stayed here?" They said, "We have stayed perhaps a day, or part of a day." They said, "God alone knows best how long you have stayed here. Now send one of you with this money to the town: let him find out which is the best food and bring some to you, that you may satisfy your hunger therewith: And let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform anyone about you." We awakened them that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said: How long have you tarried? They said: We have tarried a day or some part of a day. Others said: Your Lord best knows what you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver coin to the city, and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous and let no man know of you.

For if they should come upon you, they would stone you or force you to return to their cult, and in that case you would never attain prosperity. For if they should come to know of you, they will stone you or turn you back to their religion; then you will never prosper. For surely if they prevail against you, they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed.

Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. Some said, "Construct a building over them": Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, "Let us surely build a place of worship over them." We disclosed them to the people of the city that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When the people of the city disputed their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knows best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We shall build a place of worship over them.

Some say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; others say they were five, the dog being the sixth, doubtfully guessing at the unknown; yet others say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say: My Lord knows best their number; It is but few that know their real case. Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about the affair of the Sleepers. Some will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and some say: Five, their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and some say: Seven, and their dog the eighth. Say: My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None knows them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending, and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them. Some say: They are three, the fourth of them being their dog; and others say: Five, the sixth of them being their dog, making conjectures at what is unknown; and others yet say: Seven, and the eighth of them is their dog. Say: My Lord best knows their number, none knows them but a few; therefore contend not in the matter of them but with an outward contention, and do not question concerning them any of them.

Nor say of anything, "I shall be sure to do so and so tomorrow" without adding, "So please God!" and call your Lord to mind when you forget, and say, "I hope that my Lord will guide me ever closer to the right road." And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow, except if God wills. And remember your Lord when you forget and say: Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer way of truth than this. And do not say of anything: Surely I will do it tomorrow, unless God pleases; and remember your Lord when you forget and say: Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer course to the right than this.

So they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, and some add nine more. And it is said they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine. And they remained in their cave three hundred years and some add another nine.

Say: God knows best how long they stayed: with Him is the knowledge of the secrets of the heavens and the earth: how clearly He sees, how finely He hears everything! They have no protector other than Him; nor does He share His Command with any person whatsoever. Say: God is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no protecting friend beside Him, and He makes none to share in His government. Say: God knows best how long they remained; to Him are known the unseen things of the heavens and the earth; how clear His sight and how clear His hearing! There is none to be a guardian for them besides Him, and He does not make anyone His associate in His Judgment.

And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord: none can change His Words, and none will you find as a refuge other than Him. And recite that which has been revealed unto you of the Scripture of your Lord. There is none who can change His words, and you will find no refuge beside Him. And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord, there is none who can alter His words; and you shall not find any refuge besides Him.

And keep your soul content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face; and let not your eyes pass beyond them, seeking the pomp and glitter of this Life; do not obey any whose heart We have permitted to neglect the remembrance of Us, one who follows his own desires, whose case has gone beyond all bounds. Restrain yourself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follows his own lust and whose case has been abandoned. And withhold yourself with those who call on their Lord morning and evening desiring His goodwill, and let not your eyes pass from them, desiring the beauties of this world's life; and do not follow him whose heart We have made unmindful to Our remembrance, and he follows his low desires and his case is one in which due bounds are exceeded.

Say, "The truth is from your Lord": Let him who will believe, and let him who will, reject it: for the wrong-doers We have prepared a Fire whose smoke and flames, like the walls and roof of a tent, will hem them in: if they implore relief they will be granted water like melted brass, that will scald their faces, how dreadful the drink! How uncomfortable a couch to recline on! Say: It is the truth from the Lord of you all. Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloses them. If they ask for showers, they will be showered with water like molten lead which burns the faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting-place! And say: The truth is from your Lord, so let him who pleases believe, and let him who pleases disbelieve; surely We have prepared for the iniquitous a fire, the curtains of which shall encompass them about; and if they cry for water, they shall be given water like molten brass which will scald their faces; evil the drink and ill the resting-place.

As to those who believe and work righteousness, verily We shall not suffer to perish the reward of any who do a single righteous deed. Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost. Surely as for those who believe and do good, We do not waste the reward of him who does a good work.

For them will be Gardens of Eternity; beneath them rivers will flow; they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade. They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good the reward! How beautiful a resting place!most certainly be questioned about that which you forged. And they assign daughters for God! - Glory be to Him! - and for themselves (sons, the issue) they desire! When news is brought to one of them, of the birth of a female child, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief! With shame does he hide himself from his people, because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain it on sufferance and contempt, or bury it in the dust? Ah! what an evil choice they decide on! To those who believe not in the Hereafter, applies the similitude of evil: to God applies the highest similitude: for He is the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. If God were to punish men for their wrong-doing, He would not leave, on the earth, a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: When their Term expires, they would not be able to delay the punishment for a single hour, just as they would not be able to anticipate it for a single hour. They attribute to God what they hate for themselves, and their tongues assert the falsehood that all good things are for themselves: without doubt for them is the Fire, and they will be the first to be hastened on into it! By God, We also sent Our messengers to Peoples before thee; but Satan made, to the wicked, their own acts seem alluring: He is also their patron today, but they shall have a most grievous penalty. And We sent down the Book to thee for the express purpose, that thou shouldst make clear to them those things in which they differ, and that it should be a guide and a mercy to those who believe. And God sends down rain from the skies, and gives therewith life to the earth after its death: verily in this is a Sign for those who listen. And verily in cattle too will ye find an instructive sign. From what is within their bodies between excretions and blood, We produce, for your drink, milk, pure and agreeable to those who drink it. And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out wholesome drink and food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise. And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in men's habitations; Then to eat of all the produce of the earth, and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought. It is God who creates you and takes your souls at death; and of you there are some who are sent back to a feeble age, so that they know nothing after having known much: for God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful. God has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others: those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so as to be equal in that respect. Will they then deny the favours of God? And God has made for you mates and companions of your own nature, and made for you, out of them, sons and daughters and grandchildren, and provided for you sustenance of the best: will they then believe in vain things, and be ungrateful for God's favours? And worship others than God, such as have no power of providing them, for sustenance, with anything in heavens or earth, and cannot possibly have such power? Invent not similitudes for God: for God knoweth, and ye know not. God sets forth the Parable of two men: one a slave under the dominion of another; He has no power of any sort; and the other a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favours from Ourselves, and he spends thereof freely, privately and publicly: are the two equal? Praise be to God. But most of them understand not.God sets forth a parable of two men: one of them dumb, with no power of any sort; a burden to his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal with one who commands justice and is on a straight path? To God belongs the mystery of the heavens and the earth. The decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is as the twinkling of an eye, or even quicker: for God has power over all things. It is He who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when you knew nothing; and He gave you hearing, sight, intelligence, and affections: that you may give thanks to God. Do they not look at the birds, held poised in the midst of the air and sky? Nothing holds them up but the power of God. Verily in this are signs for those who believe. God made your habitations homes of rest and quiet for you; and made for you, out of the skins of animals, tents for dwellings, which you find light when you travel and when you stop; and out of their wool, soft fibers, and hair, rich stuff and articles of convenience to serve you for a time. God made out of the things He created, some things to give you shade; of the hills, He made some for your shelter; He made you garments to protect you from heat, and coats of mail to protect you from your mutual violence. Thus does He complete His favors on you, that you may bow to His will. If they turn away, your duty is only to preach the clear message. They recognize the favors of God; then they deny them; and most of them are ungrateful. One day We shall raise from all peoples a witness: then no excuse will be accepted from unbelievers, nor will they receive any favors. When the wrong-doers see the penalty, it will not be mitigated, nor will they receive respite. When those who gave partners to God see their "partners," they will say: "Our Lord! These are our 'partners,' those whom we used to invoke besides Thee." But they will throw back their word at them and say: "Indeed you are liars!" That day they shall openly show their submission to God; and all their inventions shall leave them in the lurch. Those who reject God and hinder men from the path of God - for them, We will add penalty to penalty; for they used to spread mischief. One day We shall raise from all peoples a witness against them, from amongst themselves: and We shall bring you as a witness against these people. We have sent down to you the Book explaining all things, a guide, a mercy, and glad tidings to Muslims. God commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin, and He forbids all shameful deeds, injustice, and rebellion: He instructs you, that you may receive admonition. Fulfill the covenant of God when you have entered into it, and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them; indeed you have made God your surety; for God knows all that you do. And be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong. Nor take your oaths to practice deception between yourselves, lest one party should be more numerous than another: for God will test you by this; and on the Day of Judgment, He will certainly make clear to you the truth of that wherein you disagree. If God so willed, He could make you all one people: but He leaves straying whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases: but you shall certainly be called to account for all your actions. And take not your oaths to practice deception between yourselves, with the result that someone's foot may slip after it was firmly placed."Do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after its stability and you taste evil for having hindered men from the Path of God, and a Mighty Wrath descends on you. Do not sell the covenant of God for a miserable price; what is with God is far better for you if you only knew. What is with you must vanish; what is with God will endure. We will certainly bestow on those who patiently persevere their reward according to the best of their actions. Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, to them We will give a new life, a life that is good and pure, and We will bestow on them their reward according to the best of their actions. When you read the Qur'an, seek God's protection from Satan the rejected one. He has no authority over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord. His authority is only over those who take him as a patron and join partners with God. When We substitute one revelation for another, they say, 'You are but a forger,' but most of them understand not. Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from your Lord in Truth, to strengthen those who believe, and as a Guide and Glad Tidings to Muslims. We know indeed that they say, 'It is a man that teaches him.' The tongue of him they wickedly point to is notably foreign, while this is Arabic, pure and clear. Those who believe not in the Signs of God, God will not guide them, and theirs will be a grievous Penalty. It is those who believe not in the Signs of God that forge falsehood; it is they who lie. Any one who, after accepting faith in God, utters Unbelief, except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith, on them is Wrath from God, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty. This is because they love the life of this world better than the Hereafter, and God will not guide those who reject Faith. Those are they whose hearts, ears, and eyes God has sealed up, and they take no heed. Without doubt, in the Hereafter they will perish. But verily your Lord, to those who leave their homes after trials and persecutions, and who thereafter strive and fight for the faith and patiently persevere, your Lord, after all this, is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. One Day every soul will come up struggling for itself, and every soul will be recompensed fully for all its actions, and none will be unjustly dealt with. God sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place, yet it was ungrateful for the favors of God, so God made it taste of hunger and terror in extremes because of the evil which its people wrought. And there came to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they falsely rejected him, so the Wrath seized them even in the midst of their iniquities. So eat of the sustenance which God has provided for you, lawful and good, and be grateful for the favors of God if it is He Whom you serve. He has only forbidden you dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and any food over which the name of other than God has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Do not say for any false thing that your tongues may put forth, 'This is lawful, and this is forbidden,' so as to ascribe false things to God. For those who ascribe false things to God will never prosper."This will contain the original content of the document, unchanged just edited to be more readable and AI friendly.

...and they will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade: They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good the recompense! How beautiful a couch to recline on! As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon thrones therein. Blest the reward, and fair the resting-place! These it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow, ornaments shall be given to them therein of bracelets of gold, and they shall wear green robes of fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold, reclining therein on raised couches; excellent the recompense and goodly the resting place.

Set forth to them the parable of two men: for one of them We provided two gardens of grape-vines and surrounded them with date palms; in between the two We placed corn-fields. Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put between them tillage. And set forth to them a parable of two men; for one of them We made two gardens of grape vines, and We surrounded them both with palms, and in the midst of them We made cornfields.

Each of those gardens brought forth its produce, and failed not in the least therein: in the midst of them We caused a river to flow. Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein. Both these gardens yielded their fruits, and failed not aught thereof, and We caused a river to gush forth in their midst.

(Abundant) was the produce this man had: he said to his companion, in the course of a mutual argument: "More wealth have I than you, and more honour and power in (my following of) men." And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men. And he possessed much wealth; so he said to his companion, while he disputed with him: I have greater wealth than you, and am mightier in followers.

He went into his garden in a state (of mind) unjust to his soul: He said, "I deem not that this will ever perish," And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself. He said: I think not that all this will ever perish. And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said: I do not think that this will ever perish,

"Nor do I deem that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) come: Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I shall surely find (there) something better in exchange." I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort. And I do not think the hour will come, and even if I am returned to my Lord I will most certainly find a returning place better than this.

His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him: "Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man?" His comrade, when he (thus) spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop (of seed), and then fashioned thee a man? His companion said to him while disputing with him: Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust, then from a small seed, then He made you a perfect man?

"But (I think) for my part that He is God, My Lord, and none shall I associate with my Lord." But He is God, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner. But as for me, He, God, is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord.

"Why didst thou not, as thou wentest into thy garden, say: 'God's will (be done)! There is no power but with God!' If thou dost see me less than thee in wealth and sons," If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which God willeth (will come to pass)! There is no strength save in God! Though thou seest me as less than thee in wealth and children, And wherefore did you not say when you entered your garden: It is as God has pleased, there is no power save in God? If you consider me to be inferior to you in wealth and children,

"It may be that my Lord will give me something better than thy garden, and that He will send on thy garden thunderbolts (by way of reckoning) from heaven, making it (but) slippery sand!" Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside, Then maybe my Lord will give me what is better than your garden, and send on it a thunderbolt from heaven so that it shall become even ground without plant,

"Or the water of the garden will run off underground so that thou wilt never be able to find it." Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it. Or its waters should sink down into the ground so that you are unable to find it.

So his fruits (and enjoyment) were encompassed (with ruin), and he remained twisting and turning his hands over what he had spent on his property, which had (now) tumbled to pieces to its very foundations, and he could only say, "Woe is me! Would I had never ascribed partners to my Lord and Cherisher!" And his fruit was beset (with destruction). Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent upon it, when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord! And his wealth was destroyed; so he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it, while it lay, having fallen down upon its roofs, and he said: Ah me! would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord.

Nor had he numbers to help him against God, nor was he able to deliver himself. And he had no troop of men to help him as against God, nor could he save himself. And he had no host to help him besides God nor could he defend himself.

There, the (only) protection comes from God, the True One. He is the Best to reward, and the Best to give success. In this case is protection only from God, the True, He is Best for reward, and best for consequence. Here is protection only God's, the True One; He is best in (the giving of) reward and best in requiting.

Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which we send down from the skies: the earth's vegetation absorbs it, but soon it becomes dry stubble, which the winds do scatter: it is (only) God who prevails over all things. And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. God is able to do all things. And set forth to them parable of the life of this world: like water which We send down from the cloud so the herbage of the earth becomes tangled on account of it, then it becomes dry broken into pieces which the winds scatter; and God is the holder of power over all things.

Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world: But the things that endure, good deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best as (the foundation for) hopes. Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in respect of hope. Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world; and the ever-abiding, the good works, are better with your Lord in reward and better in expectation.

One Day We shall remove the mountains, and thou wilt see the earth as a level stretch, and We shall gather them, all together, nor shall We leave out any one of them. And (bethink you of) the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind. And the day on which We will cause the mountains to pass away and you will see the earth a levelled plain and We will gather them and leave not any one of them behind.

And they will be marshalled before thy Lord in ranks, (with the announcement), "Now have ye come to Us (bare) as We created you first: aye, ye thought We shall not fulfill the appointment made to you to meet (Us)!" And they are set before thy Lord in ranks (and it is said unto them): Now verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that We had set no tryst for you. And they shall be brought before your Lord, standing in ranks: Now certainly you have come to Us as We created you at first. Nay, you thought that We had not appointed to you a time of the fulfillment of the promise.

And the Book (of Deeds) will be placed (before you); and thou wilt see the sinful in great terror because of what is (recorded) therein; they will say, "Ah! woe to us! what a Book is this! It leaves out nothing small or great, but takes account thereof!" They will find all that they did, placed before them: And not one will thy Lord treat with injustice. And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did confronting them, and thy Lord wrongeth no-one. And the Book shall be placed, then you will see the guilty fearing from what is in it, and they will say: Ah! woe to us! what a book is this! it does not omit a small one nor a great one, but numbers them (all); and what they had done they shall find present (there); and your Lord does not deal unjustly with anyone.

Behold! We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam": They bowed down except Iblis. He was one of the jinns, and he broke the Command of his Lord. Will ye then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me? And they are enemies to you! Evil would be the exchange for the wrong-doers! And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord's command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of Me, when they are an enemy unto you? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers. And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam; they made obeisance but Iblis (did it not). He was of the jinn, so he transgressed the commandment of his Lord. What! would you then take him and his offspring for friends rather than Me, and they are your enemies? Evil is (this) change for the unjust.

I called them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (even) their own creation: nor is it for help...I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of their own creation; nor could I take those who lead others astray for aiders.

One Day He will say, "Call on those whom you thought to be My partners," and they will call on them, but they will not listen to them; and We shall make for them a place of common perdition.

And the guilty shall see the fire, then they shall know that they are going to fall into it, and they shall not find a place to which to turn away from it.

We have explained in detail in this Qur'an, for the benefit of mankind, every kind of similitude: but man is, in most things, contentious.

And nothing prevents men from believing when the guidance comes to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, except that what happened to the ancients should overtake them, or that the chastisement should come face to face with them.

We only send the messengers to give Glad Tidings and to give warnings: But the unbelievers dispute with vain argument, in order therewith to weaken the truth, and they treat My Signs as a jest, as also the fact that they are warned!

And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the communications of his Lord, then he turns away from them and forgets what his two hands have sent before? Surely We have placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it and a heaviness in their ears; and if you call them to the guidance, they will not ever follow the right course in that case.

But your Lord is Most Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to call them at once to account for what they have earned, then surely He would have hastened their punishment: but they have their appointed time, beyond which they will find no refuge.

Such were the populations we destroyed when they committed iniquities; but we fixed an appointed time for their destruction.

Behold, Moses said to his attendant, "I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or until I spend years and years in travel."

But when they reached the Junction, they forgot about their Fish, which took its course through the sea straight as in a tunnel.

When they had passed on some distance, Moses said to his attendant: "Bring us our early meal; truly we have suffered much fatigue at this stage of our journey."

He replied: "Did you see when we took refuge on the rock then I forgot the fish, and nothing made me forget to speak of it but Satan, and it took its way into the river; what a wonder!"

Moses said: "This is what we sought for;" so they returned retracing their footsteps.

So they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves and whom We had taught knowledge from Our own Presence.

Moses said to him: "May I follow you, on the footing that you teach me something of the Higher Truth which you have been taught?"

He said: "Surely you cannot have patience with me."

"And how can you have patience in that of which you have not got a comprehensive knowledge?"

Moses said: "If God pleases, you will find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any matter."

He said: "If you would follow me, then do not question me about anything until I myself speak to you about it."

So they both proceeded: until, when they were in the boat, he scuttled it. Moses said: "Have you made a hole in it to drown its inmates? Certainly you have done a grievous thing."

He answered: "Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?"

Moses said: "Blame me not for what I forgot, and do not constrain me to a difficult thing in my affair."

Then they proceeded: until, when they met a young man, he slew him. Moses said: "Have you slain an innocent person who had slain none? Truly a foul thing you have done!"soul who hath slain no man? Verily thou hast done a horrid thing." 

He answered: "Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me?" 

Moses said: "If ever I ask thee about anything after this, keep me not in thy company: then wouldst thou have received (full) excuse from my side."

Then they proceeded: until, when they came to the inhabitants of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused them hospitality. They found there a wall on the point of falling down, but he set it up straight. Moses said: "If thou hadst wished, surely thou couldst have exacted some recompense for it!"

He answered: "This is the parting between me and thee: now will I tell thee the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience."

"As for the boat, it belonged to certain men in dire want: they plied on the water: I but wished to render it unserviceable, for there was after them a certain king who seized on every boat by force."

"As for the youth, his parents were people of Faith, and we feared that he would grieve them by obstinate rebellion and ingratitude (to God and man)."

"So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange (a son) better in purity (of conduct) and closer in affection."

"As for the wall, it belonged to two youths, orphans, in the Town; there was, beneath it, a buried treasure, to which they were entitled: their father had been a righteous man: So thy Lord desired that they should attain their age of full strength and get out their treasure - a mercy (and favour) from thy Lord. I did it not of my own accord. Such is the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience."

They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain. Say, "I will rehearse to you something of his story."

Verily We established his power on earth, and We gave him the ways and the means to all ends.

One (such) way he followed,

Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water: Near it he found a People: We said: "O Zul-qarnain! (thou hast authority,) either to punish them, or to treat them with kindness."

He said: "Whoever doth wrong, him shall we punish; then shall he be sent back to his Lord; and He will punish him with a punishment unheard-of (before)."

"But whoever believes, and works righteousness,- he shall have a goodly reward, and easy will be his task as We order it by our Command."

Then followed he (another) way,

Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no covering protection against the sun.

(He left them) as they were: We completely understood what was before him.

Then followed he (another) way,

Until, when he reached (a tract) between two mountains, he found, beneath them, a people who scarcely understood a word.

They said: "O Zul-qarnain! the Gog and Magog (People) do great mischief on earth: shall we then render thee tribute in order that thou mightest erect a barrier between us and them?"

He said: "(The power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than tribute): Help me therefore with strength (and labour): I will erect a strong barrier between you and them:"

"Bring me blocks of iron." At length, when he had filled up the space between the two steep mountain-sides, He said, "Blow (with your bellows)" Then, when he had made it (red) as fire, he said: "Bring me, that I may pour over it, molten lead."

Thus were they made powerless to scale it or to dig through it.

He said: "This is a mercy from my Lord: But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it into dust; and the promise of my Lord is true."

On that day We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another: the trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them all together.against God shall not prosper. 016.117 Y: (In such falsehood) is but a paltry profit; but they will have a most grievous Penalty. P: A brief enjoyment (will be theirs); and theirs a painful doom. S: A little enjoyment and they shall have a painful punishment. 016.118 Y: To the Jews We prohibited such things as We have mentioned to thee before: We did them no wrong, but they were used to doing wrong to themselves. P: And unto those who are Jews We have forbidden that which We have already related unto thee. And We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong themselves. S: And for those who were Jews We prohibited what We have related to you already, and We did them no injustice, but they were unjust to themselves. 016.119 Y: But verily thy Lord,- to those who do wrong in ignorance, but who thereafter repent and make amends,- thy Lord, after all this, is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: Then lo! thy Lord - for those who do evil in ignorance and afterward repent and amend - lo! (for them) thy Lord is afterward indeed Forgiving, Merciful. S: Yet surely your Lord, with respect to those who do an evil in ignorance, then turn after that and make amends, most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving, Merciful. 016.120 Y: Abraham was indeed a model, devoutly obedient to God, (and) true in Faith, and he joined not gods with God: P: Lo! Abraham was a nation obedient to God, by nature upright, and he was not of the idolaters; S: Surely Ibrahim was an exemplar, obedient to God, upright, and he was not of the polytheists. 016.121 Y: He showed his gratitude for the favours of God, who chose him, and guided him to a Straight Way. P: Thankful for His bounties; He chose him and He guided him unto a straight path. S: Grateful for His favors; He chose him and guided him on the right path. 016.122 Y: And We gave him Good in this world, and he will be, in the Hereafter, in the ranks of the Righteous. P: And We gave him good in the world, and in the Hereafter he is among the righteous. S: And We gave him good in this world, and in the next he will most surely be among the good. 016.123 Y: So We have taught thee the inspired (Message), "Follow the ways of Abraham the True in Faith, and he joined not gods with God." P: And afterward We inspired thee (Muhammad, saying): Follow the religion of Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters. S: Then We revealed to you: Follow the faith of Ibrahim, the upright one, and he was not of the polytheists. 016.124 Y: The Sabbath was only made (strict) for those who disagreed (as to its observance); But God will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, as to their differences. P: The Sabbath was appointed only for those who differed concerning it, and lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ. S: The Sabbath was ordained only for those who differed about it, and most surely your Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that about which they differed. 016.125 Y: Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lord knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance. P: Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation, and reason with them in the better way. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is Best Aware of those who go aright. S: Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and have disputations with them in the best manner; surely your Lord best knows those who go astray from His path, and He knows best those who follow the right way. 016.126 Y: And if ye do catch them out, catch them out no worse than they catch you out: But if ye show patience, that is indeed the best (course) for those who are patient. P: If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted. But if ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient. S: And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you are patient, it will certainly be best for those who are patient. 016.127 Y: And do thou be patient, for thy patience is but from God; nor grieve over them: and distress not thyself because of their plots. P: Endure thou patiently (O Muhammad). Thine endurance is only by (the help of) God. Grieve not for them, and be not in distress because of that which they devise. S: And be patient and your patience is not but by (the assistance of) God, and grieve not for them, and do not distress yourself at what they plan. 016.128 Y: For God is with those who restrain themselves, and those who do good. P: Lo! God is with those who keep their duty unto Him and those who are doers of good. S: Surely God is with those who guard (against evil) and those who do good (to others). - Chapter 17: AL-ISRA (ISRA', THE NIGHT JOURNEY, CHILDREN OF ISRAEL) Total Verses: 111 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 017.001 Y: Glory to (God) Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless,- in order that We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth and seeth (all things). P: Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place of Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, that We might show him of Our tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer. S: Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have blessed the precincts, so that We may show to him some of Our signs; surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing. 017.002 Y: We gave Moses the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of Israel, (commanding): "Take not other than Me as Disposer of (your) affairs." P: We gave unto Moses the Scripture, and We appointed it a guidance for the children of Israel, saying: Choose no guardian beside Me. S: And We gave Musa the Book and made it a guidance to the children of Israel, saying: Do not take a protector besides Me; 017.003 Y: O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah! Verily he was a devotee most grateful. P: (They were) the seed of those whom We carried (in the ship) along with Noah. Lo! he was a grateful slave. S: The offspring of those whom We bore with Nuh; surely he was a grateful servant. 017.004 Y: And We gave (Clear) Warning to the Children of Israel in the Book, that twice would they do mischief on the earth and be elated with mighty arrogance (and twice would they be punished)! P: And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: Ye verily will work corruption in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants. S: And We had made known to the children of Israel in the Book: Most certainly you will make mischief in the land twice, and most certainly you will behave insolently with great insolence. 017.005 Y: When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you Our servants given to terrible warfare: They entered the very inmost parts of your homes; and it was a warning (completely) fulfilled. P: So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves of Ours of great might who ravaged (your) country, and it was a threat performed. S: So when the promise for the first of the two came, We sent over you Our servants, of mighty prowess, so they went to and fro among the houses, and it was a promise to be accomplished. 017.006 Y: Then did We grant you the Return as against them: We gave you increase in resources and sons, and made you the more numerous in man-power. P: Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery. S: Then We gave you back the turn to prevail against them, and aided you with wealth and children and made you a numerous band. 017.007 Y: If ye did well, ye did well for yourselves; if ye did evil, (ye did it) against yourselves. So when the second of the warnings came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disfigure your faces, and to enter your Temple as they had entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that fell into their power. P: (Saying): If ye do good, ye do good for your own souls, and if ye do evil, it is for them (in like manner). So, when the time for the second (of the judgments) came (We roused against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you, and to enter the Temple even as they entered it the first time, and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting. S: If you do good, you will do good for your own souls, and if you do evil, it shall be for them. So when the second promise came (We raised another people) that they may bring you to grief and that they may enter the mosque as they entered it the first time, and that they might destroy whatever they gained ascendancy over with utter destruction. 017.008 Y: It may be that your Lord may (yet) show Mercy unto you; but if ye revert (to your sins), We shall revert (to Our punishments): And we have made Hell a prison for those who reject (all Faith). P: It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, but if ye repeat (the crime) We shall repeat (the punishment), and We have appointed hell a dungeon for the disbelievers. S: It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, and if you again return (to disobedience) We too will return (to punishment), and We have made hell a prison for the unbelievers. 017.009 Y: Verily this Qur'an doth guide to that which is most right (or stable), and giveth the Glad Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they shall have a magnificent reward; P: Lo! this Qur'an guideth unto that which is straightest, and giveth tidings unto the believers who do good works that theirs will be a great reward. S: Surely this Quran guides to that which is most upright and gives good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a great reward. 017.010 Y: And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, (it announceth) that We have prepared for them a Penalty Grievous (indeed). P: And that those who believe not in the Hereafter, for them We have prepared a painful doom. S: And that (as for) those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have prepared for them a painful chastisement. 017.011 Y: The prayer that man should make for good, he maketh for evil; for man is given to hasty (deeds). P: Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good; for man was ever hasty. S: And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good, and man is ever hasty. 017.012 Y: We have made the Night and the Day as two (of Our) Signs: the Sign of the Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the number and count of the years: all things haveWe explained in detail. P: And We appoint the night and the day two portents. Then We make dark the portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight-giving, that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the computation of the years, and the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with a clear expounding. S: And We have made the night and the day two signs, then We have made the sign of the night to pass away and We have made the sign of the day manifest, so that you may seek grace from your Lord, and that you might know the numbering of years and the reckoning; and We have explained everything with distinctness. 017.013 Y: Every man's fate We have fastened on his own neck: On the Day of Judgment We shall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread open. P: And every man's augury have We fastened to his own neck, and We shall bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open. S: And We have made every man's actions to cling to his neck, and We will bring forth to him on the resurrection day a book which he will find wide open: 017.014 Y: (It will be said to him:) "Read thine (own) record: Sufficient is thy soul this day to make out an account against thee." P: (And it will be said unto him): Read thy Book. Thy soul sufficeth as reckoner against thee this day. S: Read your book; your own self is sufficient as a reckoner against you this day. 017.015 Y: Who receiveth guidance, receiveth it for his own benefit: who goeth astray doth so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent a messenger (to give warning). P: Whosoever goeth right, it is only for (the good of) his own soul that he goeth right, and whosoever erreth, erreth only to its hurt. No laden soul can bear another's load, We never punish until we have sent a messenger. S: Whoever goes aright, for his own soul does he go aright; and whoever goes astray, to its detriment only does he go astray: nor can the bearer of a burden bear the burden of another, nor do We chastise until We raise a messenger. 017.016 Y: When We decide to destroy a population, We (first) send a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress; so that the word is proved true against them: then (it is) We destroy them utterly. P: And when We would destroy a township We send commandment to its folk who live at ease, and afterward they commit abomination therein, and so the Word (of doom) hath effect for it, and we annihilate it with complete annihilation. S: And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction. 017.017 Y: How many generations have We destroyed after Noah? and enough is thy Lord to note and see the sins of His servants. P: How many generations have We destroyed since Noah! And God sufficeth as Knower and Beholder of the sins of His slaves. S: And how many of the generations did We destroy after Nuh! and your Lord is sufficient as Knowing and Seeing with regard to His servants' faults. 017.018 Y: If any do wish for the transitory things (of this life), We readily grant them - such things as We will, to such person as We will: in the end have We provided Hell for them: they will burn therein, disgraced and rejected. P: Whoso desireth that (life) which hasteneth away, We hasten for him therein what We will for whom We please. And afterward We have appointed for him hell; he will endure the heat thereof, condemned, rejected. S: Whoever desires this present life, We hasten to him therein what We please for whomsoever We desire, then We assign to him the hell; he shall enter it despised, driven away. 017.019 Y: Those who do wish for the (things of) the Hereafter, and strive therefor with all due striving, and have Faith,- they are the ones whose striving is acceptable (to God). P: And whoso desireth the Hereafter and striveth for it with the effort necessary, being a believer; for such, their effort findeth favour (with their Lord). S: And whoever desires the hereafter and strives for it as he ought to strive and he is a believer; (as for) these, their striving shall surely be accepted. 017.020 Y: Of the bounties of thy Lord We bestow freely on all- These as well as those: The bounties of thy Lord are not closed (to anyone). P: Each do We supply, both these and those, from the bounty of thy Lord. And the bounty of thy Lord can never be walled up. S: All do We aid these as well as those out of the bounty of your Lord, and the bounty of your Lord is not confined. 017.021 Y: See how We have bestowed more on some than on others; but verily the Hereafter is more in rank and gradation and more in excellence. P: See how We prefer one of them above another, and verily the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment. S: See how We have made some of them to excel others, and certainly the hereafter is much superior in respect of excellence. 017.022 Y: Take not with God another object of worship; or thou (O man!) wilt sit in disgrace and destitution. P: Set not up with God any other god (O man) lest thou sit down reproved, forsaken. S: Do not associate with God any other god, lest you sit down despised, neglected. 017.023 Y: Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but Him, and that ye be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honour. P: Thy Lord hath decreed, that ye worship none save Him, and (that ye show) kindness to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee, say not "Fie" unto them nor repulse them, but speak unto them a gracious word. S: And your Lord has commanded that you shall not serve (any) but Him, and goodness to your parents. If either or both of them reach old age with you, say not to them (so much as) "Ugh" nor chide them, and speak to them a generous word. 017.024 Y: And, out of kindness, lower to them the wing of humility, and say: "My Lord! bestow on them thy Mercy even as they cherished me in childhood." P: And lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy, and say: My Lord! Have mercy on them both as they did care for me when I was little. S: And make yourself submissively gentle to them with compassion, and say: O my Lord! have compassion on them, as they brought me up (when I was) little. 017.025 Y: Your Lord knoweth best what is in your hearts: If ye do deeds of righteousness, verily He is Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again and again (in true penitence). P: Your Lord is Best Aware of what is in your minds. If ye are righteous, then lo! He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn (unto Him). S: Your Lord knows best what is in your minds; if you are good, then He is surely Forgiving to those who turn (to Him) frequently. 017.026 Y: And render to the kindred their due rights, as (also) to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. P: Give the kinsman his due, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and squander not (thy wealth) in wantonness. S: And give to the near of kin his due and (to) the needy and the wayfarer, and do not squander wastefully. 017.027 Y: Verily spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones; and the Evil One is to his Lord (himself) ungrateful. P: Lo! the squanderers were ever brothers of the devils, and the devil was ever an ingrate to his Lord. S: Surely the squanderers are the fellows of the Shaitans and the Shaitan is ever ungrateful to his Lord. 017.028 Y: And even if thou hast to turn away from them in pursuit of the Mercy from thy Lord which thou dost expect, yet speak to them a word of easy kindness. P: But if thou turn away from them, seeking mercy from thy Lord, for which thou hopest, then speak unto them a reasonable word. S: And if you turn away from them to seek mercy from your Lord, which you hope for, speak to them a gentle word. 017.029 Y: Make not thy hand tied (like a niggard's) to thy neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach, so that thou become blameworthy and destitute. P: And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete opening, lest thou sit down rebuked, denuded. S: And do not make your hand to be shackled to your neck nor stretch it forth to the utmost (limit) of its stretching forth, lest you should (afterwards) sit down blamed, stripped off. 017.030 Y: Verily thy Lord doth provide sustenance in abundance for whom He pleaseth, and He provideth in a just measure. For He doth know and regard all His servants. P: Lo! thy Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo, He was ever Knower, Seer of His slaves. S: Surely your Lord makes plentiful the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and He straitens (them); surely He is ever Aware of, Seeing, His servants. 017.031 Y: Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin. P: Slay not your children, fearing a fall to poverty, We shall provide for them and for you. Lo! the slaying of them is great sin. S: And do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We give them sustenance and yourselves (too); surely to kill them is a great wrong. 017.032 Y: Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful (deed) and an evil, opening the road (to other evils). P: And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is an abomination and an evil way. S: And go not nigh to fornication; surely it is an indecency and an evil way. 017.033 Y: Nor take life - which God has made sacred - except for just cause. And if anyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his heir authority (to demand qisas or to forgive): but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped (by the Law). P: And slay not the life which God hath forbidden save with right. Whoso is slain wrongfully, We have given power unto his heir, but let him not commit excess in slaying. Lo! he will be helped. S: And do not kill any one whom God has forbidden, except for a just cause, and whoever is slain unjustly, We have indeed given to his heir authority, so let him not exceed the just limits in slaying; surely he is aided. 017.034 Y: Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength; and fulfil (every) engagement, for (every) engagement will be enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning). P: Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he come to strength; and keep the covenant. Lo! of the covenant it will be asked. S: And draw not near to the property of the orphan except in a goodly way till he attains his maturity and fulfill the promise; surely (every) promise shall be questioned about. 017.035 Y: Gthe trumpet will be blown, so We will gather them all together; 018.100 Y: And We shall present Hell that day for Unbelievers to see, all spread out,- P: On that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers, plain to view, S: And We will bring forth hell, exposed to view, on that day before the unbelievers. 018.101 Y: (Unbelievers) whose eyes had been under a veil from remembrance of Me, and who had been unable even to hear. P: Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder, and who could not bear to hear. S: They whose eyes were under a cover from My reminder and they could not even hear. 018.102 Y: Do the Unbelievers think that they can take My servants as protectors besides Me? Verily We have prepared Hell for the Unbelievers for (their) entertainment. P: Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting friends beside Me? Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers. S: What! do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants to be guardians besides Me? Surely We have prepared hell for the entertainment of the unbelievers. 018.103 Y: Say: "Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deeds?"- P: Say: Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works? S: Say: Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in (their) deeds? 018.104 Y: "Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that they were acquiring good by their works?" P: Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world, and yet they reckon that they do good work. S: (These are) they whose labor is lost in this world's life and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of hands. 018.105 Y: They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord and the fact of their having to meet Him (in the Hereafter): vain will be their works, nor shall We, on the Day of Judgment, give them any weight. P: Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the meeting with Him. Therefore their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We assign no weight to them. S: These are they who disbelieve in the communications of their Lord and His meeting, so their deeds become null, and therefore We will not set up a balance for them on the day of resurrection. 018.106 Y: That is their reward, Hell, because they rejected Faith, and took My Signs and My Messengers by way of jest. P: That is their reward: hell, because they disbelieved, and made a jest of Our revelations and Our messengers. S: Thus it is that their recompense is hell, because they disbelieved and held My communications and My messengers in mockery. 018.107 Y: As to those who believe and work righteous deeds, they have, for their entertainment, the Gardens of Paradise, P: Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs are the Gardens of Paradise for welcome, S: Surely (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, their place of entertainment shall be the gardens of paradise, 018.108 Y: Wherein they shall dwell (for aye): no change will they wish for from them. P: Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence. S: Abiding therein; they shall not desire removal from them. 018.109 Y: Say: "If the ocean were ink (wherewith to write out) the words of my Lord, sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the words of my Lord, even if we added another ocean like it, for its aid." P: Say: Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, verily the sea would be used up before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even though We brought the like thereof to help. S: Say: If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would surely be consumed before the words of my Lord are exhausted, though We were to bring the like of that (sea) to add thereto. 018.110 Y: Say: "I am but a man like yourselves, (but) the inspiration has come to me, that your God is one God: whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner." P: Say: I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your God is only One God. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord. S: Say: I am only a mortal like you; it is revealed to me that your god is one God, therefore whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds, and not join any one in the service of his Lord. - Chapter 19: MARYAM (MARY) Total Verses: 98 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 019.001 Y: Kaf.

P: Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord. S: He said: My Lord! surely my bones are weakened and my head flares with hoariness, and, my Lord! I have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to Thee: 019.005 Y: "Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,"- P: Lo!

Oh, give me from Thy presence a successor, S: And surely I fear my cousins after me, and my wife is barren, therefore grant me from Thyself an heir, 019.006 Y: "(One that) will (truly) represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!"

S: Who should inherit me and inherit from the children of Yaqoub, and make him, my Lord, one in whom Thou art well pleased. 019.007 Y: (His prayer was answered): "O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before." P: (It was said unto him): O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him). S: O Zakariya! surely We give you good news of a boy whose name shall be Yahya: We have not made before anyone his equal. 019.008 Y: He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?" P: He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm old age? S: He said: O my Lord! when shall I have a son, and my wife is barren, and I myself have reached indeed the extreme degree of old age? 019.009 Y: He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'" P: He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I created thee before, when thou wast naught. S: He said: So shall it be, your Lord says: It is easy to Me, and indeed I created you before, when you were nothing. 019.010 Y: (Zakariya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb." P: He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights. S: He said: My Lord! give me a sign. He said: Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people three nights while in sound health. 019.011 Y: So Zakariya came out to his people from his chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate God's praises in the morning and in the evening. P: Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night. S: So he went forth to his people from his place of worship, then he made known to them that they should glorify (God) morning and evening. 019.012 Y: (To his son came the command): "O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth, P: (And it was said unto his son): O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And we gave him wisdom when a child, S: O Yahya! take hold of the Book with strength, and We granted him wisdom while yet a child, 019.013 Y: And piety (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout, P: And compassion from Our presence, and purity; and he was devout, S: And tenderness from Us and purity, and he was one who guarded (against evil), 019.014 Y: And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious.

P: Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and the day he shall be raised alive! S: And peace on him on the day he was born, and on the day he dies, and on the day he is raised to life. 019.016 Y: Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East. P: And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East, S: And mention Marium in the Book when she drew aside from her family to an eastern place; 019.017 Y: She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects. P: And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man. S: So she took a veil (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our spirit, and there appeared to her a well-made man. 019.018 Y: She said: "I seek refuge from thee to (God) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear God." P: She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing. S: She said: Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent God, if you are one guarding (against evil). 019.019 Y: He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son." P: He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son. S: He said: I am only a messenger of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy. 019.020 Y: She said: "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?" P: She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste? S: She said: When shall I have a boy and no mortal has yet touched me, nor have I been unchaste? 019.021 Y: He said: ""Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight: that is the most fitting and the most advantageous in the final determination. Fill the measure when you measure, and weigh with a right balance; that is meet, and better in the end. And give full measure when you measure out, and weigh with a true balance; this is fair and better in the end.

And pursue not that of which you have no knowledge; for every act of hearing, or of seeing, or of feeling in the heart will be enquired into. Follow not that whereof you have no knowledge. The hearing, the sight, and the heart - of each of these it will be asked. And follow not that of which you have not the knowledge; surely the hearing, the sight, and the heart, all of these, shall be questioned about that.

Nor walk on the earth with insolence: for you cannot rend the earth asunder, nor reach the mountains in height. Walk not in the earth exultant. You cannot rend the earth, nor can you stretch to the height of the hills. Do not go about in the land exultingly, for you cannot cut through the earth nor reach the mountains in height.

Of all such things, the evil is hateful in the sight of your Lord. The evil of all that is hateful in the sight of your Lord. All this, the evil of it, is hateful in the sight of your Lord.

These are among the precepts of wisdom, which your Lord has revealed to you. Take not, with God, another object of worship, lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected. This is part of that wisdom wherewith your Lord has inspired you. Set not up with God any other god, lest you be cast into hell, reproved, abandoned. This is of what your Lord has revealed to you of wisdom, and do not associate any other god with God lest you should be thrown into hell, blamed, cast away.

Has then your Lord preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself daughters among the angels? Truly you utter a most dreadful saying! Hath your Lord then distinguished you by giving you sons, and hath chosen for Himself females from among the angels? Verily you speak an awful word! What! has then your Lord preferred to give you sons, and for Himself taken daughters from among the angels? Most surely you utter a grievous saying.

We have explained things in various ways in this Qur'an, in order that they may receive admonition, but it only increases their flight from the Truth! We have displayed Our warnings in this Qur'an that they may take heed, but it increases them in naught save aversion. Certainly, We have repeated warnings in this Quran that they may be mindful, but it does not add save to their aversion.

Say: If there had been other gods with Him, as they say, behold, they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne! Say to the disbelievers: If there were other gods along with Him, as they say, then had they sought a way against the Lord of the Throne. Say: If there were with Him gods as they say, then certainly they would have been able to seek a way to the Lord of power.

Glory to Him! He is high above all that they say! Exalted and Great beyond measure! Glorified is He, and High Exalted above what they say! Glory be to Him and exalted be He in high exaltation above what they say.

The seven heavens and the earth, and all beings therein, declare His glory: there is not a thing but celebrates His praise; And yet you understand not how they declare His glory! Verily He is Oft-Forbearing, Most Forgiving! The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein praise Him, and there is not a thing but hymneth His praise; but you understand not their praise. He is ever Clement, Forgiving. The seven heavens declare His glory and the earth too, and those who are in them; and there is not a single thing but glorifies Him with His praise, but you do not understand their glorification; surely He is Forbearing, Forgiving.

When you recite the Qur'an, We put, between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, a veil invisible. When you recite the Qur'an, We place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier. And when you recite the Quran, We place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier.

We put coverings over their hearts and minds lest they should understand the Qur'an, and deafness into their ears: when you commemorate your Lord and Him alone in the Qur'an, they turn on their backs, fleeing from the Truth. We place upon their hearts veils lest they should understand it, and in their ears a deafness; and when you make mention of your Lord alone in the Qur'an, they turn their backs in aversion. We have placed coverings on their hearts and a heaviness in their ears lest they understand it, and when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran they turn their backs in aversion.

We know best why it is they listen, when they listen to you; and when they meet in private conference, behold, the wicked say, "You follow none other than a man bewitched!" We are Best Aware of what they wish to hear when they give ear to you and when they take secret counsel, when the evil-doers say: You follow but a man bewitched. We know best what they listen to when they listen to you, and when they take counsel secretly, when the unjust say: You follow only a man deprived of reason.

See what similes they strike for you: but they have gone astray, and never can they find a way. See what similitudes they coin for you, and thus are all astray, and cannot find a road! See what they liken you to! So they have gone astray and cannot find the way.

They say: "What! when we are reduced to bones and dust, should we really be raised up to be a new creation?" And they say: When we are bones and fragments, shall we forsooth, be raised up as a new creation? And they say: What! when we shall have become bones and decayed particles, shall we then certainly be raised up, being a new creation?

Say: "(Nay!) be you stones or iron," Say: Be you stones or iron. Say: Become stones or iron,

"Or created matter which, in your minds, is hardest to be raised up, yet shall you be raised up!" then will they say: "Who will cause us to return?" Say: "He who created you first!" Then will they wag their heads towards you, and say, "When will that be?" Say, "Maybe it will be quite soon!" Or some created thing that is yet greater in your thoughts! Then they will say: Who shall bring us back to life. Say: He Who created you at the first. Then will they shake their heads at you, and say: When will it be? Say: It will perhaps be soon; Or some other creature of those which are too hard to receive life in your minds! But they will say: Who will return us? Say: Who created you at first. Still they will shake their heads at you and say: When will it be? Say: Maybe it has drawn nigh.

"It will be on a Day when He will call you, and you will answer His call with words of His praise, and you will think that you tarried but a little while!" A day when He will call you and you will answer with His praise, and you will think that you have tarried but a little while. On the day when He will call you forth, then shall you obey Him, giving Him praise, and you will think that you tarried but a little while.

Say to My servants that they should only say those things that are best: for Satan sows dissensions among them: For Satan is to man an avowed enemy. Tell My bondmen to speak that which is kindlier. The devil sows discord among them. The devil is for man an open foe. And say to My servants that they speak that which is best; surely the Shaitan sows dissensions among them; surely the Shaitan is an open enemy to man.

It is your Lord that knows you best: If He pleases, He grants you mercy, or if He pleases, punishment: We have not sent you to be a disposer of their affairs for them. Your Lord is Best Aware of you. If He will, He will have mercy on you, or if He will, He will punish you. We have not sent you as a warden over them. Your Lord knows you best; He will have mercy on you if He pleases, or He will chastise you if He pleases; and We have not sent you as being in charge of them.

And it is your Lord that knows best all beings that are in the heavens and on earth: We did bestow on some prophets more and other gifts than on others: and We gave to David the gift of the Psalms. Your Lord is Best Aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth. We preferred some of the prophets above others, and unto David We gave the Psalms. Your Lord best knows those who are in the heavens and the earth; and certainly We have made some of the prophets to excel others, and to Dawood We gave a scripture.

Say: "Call on those - besides Him - whom you fancy: they have neither the power to remove your troubles from you nor to change them." Say: Cry unto those saints and angels whom you assume to be gods beside Him, yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to change. Say: Call on those whom you assert besides Him, so they shall not control the removal of distress from you nor its transference.

Those whom they call upon do desire for themselves means of access to their Lord, even those who are nearest: they hope for His Mercy and fear His Wrath: for the Wrath of your Lord is something to take heed of. Those unto whom they cry seek the way of approach to their Lord, which of them shall be the nearest; they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom. The doom of your Lord is to be shunned. Those whom they call upon, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord whoever of them is nearest and they hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement; surely the chastisement of your Lord is a thing to be cautious of.

There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the eternal Record. There is not a township but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with dire punishment. That is set forth in the Book of Our decrees. And there is not a town but We will destroy it before the day of resurrection or chastise it with a severe chastisement; this is written in the Divine ordinance.

And We refrain from sending the signs, only because the men of former generations treated them as false: We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes, but they treated her wrongfully."We only send the Signs by way of terror and warning from evil. Nothing hinders Us from sending portents except that the people of old denied them. We gave Thamud the she-camel as a clear sign, but they wronged her. We do not send signs except to make men fear.

Behold! We told you that your Lord encompasses mankind. We granted the vision shown to you as a trial for men, as also the Cursed Tree mentioned in the Qur'an. We put terror and warning into them, but it only increases their transgression.

When We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam," they bowed down except Iblis. He said, "Shall I bow down to one created from clay?" He said, "This is the one you honored above me! If you respite me until the Day of Judgment, I will surely bring his descendants under my sway, except a few."

God said, "Go your way; if any of them follow you, Hell will be your recompense, an ample recompense. Lead to destruction those you can with your voice; make assaults on them with your cavalry and infantry; share with them wealth and children; and make promises to them." But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.

As for My servants, you have no authority over them. Your Lord is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs. Your Lord makes the ship go smoothly for you through the sea, so you may seek His bounty. He is most Merciful to you. When distress seizes you at sea, those you call upon besides Him leave you in the lurch. But when He brings you back safe to land, you turn away. Man is ever ungrateful.

Do you feel secure that He will not cause you to be swallowed up beneath the earth when you are on land, or send a violent tornado against you? Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back to sea and send a heavy gale to drown you because of your ingratitude? We have honored the sons of Adam, provided them with transport on land and sea, given them good and pure sustenance, and conferred on them special favors above a great part of Our creation.

One day We shall call together all human beings with their respective Imams. Those given their record in their right hand will read it with pleasure and will not be dealt with unjustly. But those who were blind in this world will be blind in the hereafter and most astray from the Path.

Their purpose was to tempt you away from what We revealed to you, to substitute something different in Our name. In that case, they would have made you their friend. Had We not given you strength, you would nearly have inclined to them a little. In that case, We would have made you taste an equal portion of punishment in this life and in death, and you would have found no helper against Us.

Their purpose was to scare you off the land to expel you. In that case, they would not have stayed therein after you, except for a little while. This was Our way with the messengers We sent before you. You will find no change in Our ways.

Establish regular prayers from the sun's decline till the darkness of the night, and the morning prayer and reading. The prayer and reading in the morning carry their testimony. Pray in the small watches of the morning; it would be an additional prayer for you. Soon your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory. Say, "O my Lord! Let my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honour, and likewise...""So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us': It is a matter (so) decreed." P: He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained. S: He said: Even so; your Lord says: It is easy to Me: and that We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter which has been decreed. 019.022 Y: So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. P: And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. S: So she conceived him; then withdrew herself with him to a remote place. 019.023 Y: And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!" P: And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! S: And the throes (of childbirth) compelled her to betake herself to the trunk of a palm tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died before this, and had been a thing quite forgotten! 019.024 Y: But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee;" P: Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee, S: Then (the child) called out to her from beneath her: Grieve not, surely your Lord has made a stream to flow beneath you; 019.025 Y: "And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee." P: And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee. S: And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop on you fresh ripe dates: 019.026 Y: "So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye. And if thou dost see any man, say, 'I have vowed a fast to (God) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being.'" P: So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal. S: So eat and drink and refresh the eye. Then if you see any mortal, say: Surely I have vowed a fast to the Beneficent God, so I shall not speak to any man today. 019.027 Y: At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: "O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought!" P: Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Thou hast come with an amazing thing. S: And she came to her people with him, carrying him (with her). They said: O Mary! surely you have done a strange thing. 019.028 Y: "O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste!" P: O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. S: O sister of Aaron! your father was not a bad man, nor was your mother an unchaste woman. 019.029 Y: But she pointed to the babe. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?" P: Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy? S: But she pointed to him. They said: How should we speak to one who was a child in the cradle? 019.030 Y: He said: "I am indeed a servant of God: He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet;" P: He spake: Lo! I am the slave of God. He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet, S: He said: Surely I am a servant of God; He has given me the Book and made me a prophet; 019.031 Y: "And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be, and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live;" P: And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, S: And He has made me blessed wherever I may be, and He has enjoined on me prayer and poor-rate so long as I live; 019.032 Y: "(He) hath made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable;" P: And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. S: And dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me insolent, unblessed; 019.033 Y: "So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)!" P: Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! S: And peace on me on the day I was born, and on the day I die, and on the day I am raised to life. 019.034 Y: Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute. P: Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. S: Such is Jesus, son of Mary; (this is) the saying of truth about which they dispute. 019.035 Y: It is not befitting to (the majesty of) God that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, "Be," and it is. P: It befitteth not (the Majesty of) God that He should take unto Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. S: It beseems not God that He should take to Himself a son, glory be to Him; when He has decreed a matter He only says to it "Be," and it is. 019.036 Y: Verily God is my Lord and your Lord: Him therefore serve ye: this is a Way that is straight. P: And lo! God is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right path. S: And surely God is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path. 019.037 Y: But the sects differ among themselves: and woe to the unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of a Momentous Day! P: The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of an awful Day. S: But parties from among them disagreed with each other, so woe to those who disbelieve, because of presence on a great day. 019.038 Y: How plainly will they see and hear, the Day that they will appear before Us! but the unjust today are in error manifest! P: See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are to-day in error manifest. S: How clearly shall they hear and how clearly shall they see on the day when they come to Us; but the unjust this day are in manifest error. 019.039 Y: But warn them of the Day of Distress, when the matter will be determined: for (behold,) they are negligent and they do not believe! P: And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not. S: And warn them of the day of intense regret, when the matter shall have been decided; and they are (now) in negligence and they do not believe. 019.040 Y: It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned. P: Lo! We, only We, inherit the earth and all who are thereon, and unto Us they are returned. S: Surely We inherit the earth and all those who are on it, and to Us they shall be returned. 019.041 Y: (Also) mention in the Book (the story of) Abraham: He was a man of Truth, a prophet. P: And make mention (O Muhammad) in the Scripture of Abraham. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet. S: And mention Abraham in the Book; surely he was a truthful man, a prophet. 019.042 Y: Behold, he said to his father: "O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing?" P: When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee? S: When he said to his father; O my father! why do you worship what neither hears nor sees, nor does it avail you in the least: 019.043 Y: "O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight." P: O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came not unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path. S: O my father! truly the knowledge has come to me which has not come to you, therefore follow me, I will guide you on a right path: 019.044 Y: "O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (God) Most Gracious." P: O my father! Serve not the devil. Lo! the devil is a rebel unto the Beneficent. S: O my father! serve not the Satan, surely the Satan is disobedient to the Beneficent God: 019.045 Y: "O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (God) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend." P: O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee so that thou become a comrade of the devil. S: O my father! surely I fear that a punishment from the Beneficent God should afflict you so that you should be a friend of the Satan. 019.046 Y: (The father) replied: "Dost thou hate my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while!" P: He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham? If thou cease not, I shall surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while! S: He said: Do you dislike my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist I will certainly revile you, and leave me for a time. 019.047 Y: Abraham said: "Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious." P: He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. Lo! He was ever gracious unto me. S: He said: Peace be on you, I will pray to my Lord to forgive you; surely He is ever Affectionate to me: 019.048 Y: "And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides God: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest." P: I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside God, and I shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be unblest. S: And I will withdraw from you and what you call on besides God, and I will call upon my Lord; may be I shall not remain unblessed in calling upon my Lord. 019.049 Y: When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides God, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet. P: So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping beside God, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a prophet. S: So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped besides God, We gave to him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet. 019.050 Y: And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them, and We granted them lofty honour on the tongue of truth. P: And we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true renown. S: And We granted to them of Our mercy, and We left (behind them) a truthful mention of eminence for them. 019.051 Y: Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet. P: And make mention (O Muhammad) in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was a messenger (of God), a prophet. S: And mention Moses in the Book; surely he was one purified, and he was an apostle, a prophet."my exit by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and grant me from Thy Presence an authority to aid (me)." And say: "My Lord! Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out with a firm outgoing. And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power." And say: "Truth has arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is bound to perish." And say: "The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished; surely falsehood is a vanishing thing." We send down in the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe: to the unjust it causes nothing but loss after loss. And We reveal of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy for believers though it increases the evil-doers in naught save ruin. And when We bestow Our favours on man, he turns away and becomes remote on his side, and when evil seizes him he gives himself up to despair! And when We make life pleasant unto man, he turns away and is averse; and when ill touches him he is in despair. Say: "Everyone acts according to his own disposition: But your Lord knows best who it is that is best guided on the Way." Say: "The Spirit comes by command of my Lord: of knowledge it is only a little that is communicated to you." And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto thee, then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against Us in respect thereof. Except for Mercy from thy Lord: for His bounty is to thee indeed great. Say: "If the whole of mankind and jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up each other with help and support." And We have explained to man, in this Qur'an, every kind of similitude: yet the greater part of men refuse to receive it except with ingratitude! They say: "We shall not believe in thee, until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth," Or thou have a garden of date trees and vines, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst, carrying abundant water; Or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces, as thou sayest will happen, against us; or thou bring God and the angels before us face to face; Or thou have a house adorned with gold, or thou mount a ladder right into the skies. No, we shall not even believe in thy mounting until thou send down to us a book that we could read. Say: "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a man, a messenger?" What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them, was nothing but this: they said, "Has God sent a man like us to be His Messenger?" Say: "If there were settled, on earth, angels walking about in peace and quiet, We should certainly have sent them down from the heavens an angel for a messenger." Say: "Enough is God for a witness between me and you: for He is well acquainted with His servants, and He sees all things." It is he whom God guides, that is on true Guidance; but he whom He leaves astray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather them together, prone on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf: their abode will be Hell: every time it shows abatement, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire. That is their recompense, because they rejected Our signs, and said, "When we are reduced to bones and broken dust, should we really be raised up to be a new Creation?" See they not that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, has power to create the like of them anew? Only He has decreed a term appointed, of which there is no doubt. But the unjust refuse to receive it except with ingratitude. Say: "If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, behold, ye would keep them back, for fear of spending them: for man is ever niggardly!" To Moses We did give Nine Clear Signs: As the Children of Israel: when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him: "O Moses! I consider thee, indeed, to have been worked upon by sorcery!" Moses said, "Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence: and I consider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!""mention in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was a messenger (of God), a prophet. And mention Musa in the Book; surely he was one purified, and he was a messenger, a prophet. And we called him from the right side of Mount (Sinai), and made him draw near to Us, for mystic (converse). We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in communion. And We called to him from the blessed side of the mountain, and We made him draw nigh, holding communion (with Us). And, out of Our Mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, (also) a prophet. And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet (likewise). And We gave to him out of Our mercy his brother Haroun a prophet. Also mention in the Book (the story of) Isma'il: He was (strictly) true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet. And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his promise, and he was a messenger (of God), a prophet. And mention Ismail in the Book; surely he was truthful in (his) promise, and he was a messenger, a prophet. He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord. He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in the sight of his Lord. And he enjoined on his family prayer and almsgiving, and was one in whom his Lord was well pleased. Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet: And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet; And mention Idris in the Book; surely he was a truthful man, a prophet, And We raised him to a lofty station. And We raised him to high station. And We raised him high in Heaven. Those were some of the prophets on whom God did bestow His Grace,- of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the Signs of (God) Most Gracious were rehearsed to them, they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears. These are they unto whom God showed favour from among the prophets, of the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down, adoring and weeping. These are they on whom God bestowed favors, from among the prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those whom We carried with Nuh, and of the seed of Ibrahim and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose; when the communications of the Beneficent God were recited to them, they fell down making obeisance and weeping. But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face Destruction,- Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception. But there came after them an evil generation, who neglected prayers and followed and sensual desires, so they win meet perdition, Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least,- Save him who shall repent and believe and do right. Such will enter the Garden, and they will not be wronged in aught - Except such as repent and believe and do good, these shall enter the garden, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly in any way: Gardens of Eternity, those which (God) Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen: for His promise must (necessarily) come to pass. Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the unseen. Lo! His promise is ever sure of fulfilment - The gardens of perpetuity which the Beneficent God has promised to His servants while unseen; surely His promise shall come to pass. They will not there hear any vain discourse, but only salutations of Peace: And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and evening. They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food for morn and evening. They shall not hear therein any vain discourse, but only: Peace, and they shall have their sustenance therein morning and evening. Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil. Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to inherit. This is the garden which We cause those of Our servants to inherit who guard (against evil). (The angels say:) "We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,"- We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those two, and thy Lord was never forgetful - And we do not descend but by the command of your Lord; to Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between these, and your Lord is not forgetful. "Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?" Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefore, worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can be named along with Him? The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, so serve Him and be patient in His service. Do you know any one equal to Him? Man says: "What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?" And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive? And says man: What! when I am dead shall I truly be brought forth alive? But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing? Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught? Does not man remember that We created him before, when he was nothing? So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Evil Ones (with them); then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell; And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We shall bring them, crouching, around hell. So by your Lord! We will most certainly gather them together and the Shaitans, then shall We certainly cause them to be present round hell on their knees. Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against (God) Most Gracious. Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent. Then We will most certainly draw forth from every sect of them him who is most exorbitantly rebellious against the Beneficent God. And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein. And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein. Again We do certainly know best those who deserve most to be burned therein. Not one of you but will pass over it: this is, with thy Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished. There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of thy Lord. And there is not one of you but shall come to it; this is an unavoidable decree of your Lord. But We shall save those who guarded against evil, and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein, (humbled) to their knees. Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers crouching there. And We will deliver those who guarded (against evil), and We will leave the unjust therein on their knees. When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say to those who believe, "Which of the two sides is best in point of position? Which makes the best show in council?" And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in position, and more imposing as an army? And when Our clear communications are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Which of the two parties is best in abiding and best in assembly? But how many (countless) generations before them have we destroyed, who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye? How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming! And how many of the generations have We destroyed before them who were better in respect of goods and outward appearance! Say: "If any men go astray, (God) Most Gracious extends (the rope) to them, until, when they see the warning of God (being fulfilled) - either in punishment or in (the approach of) the Hour,- they will at length realise who is worst in position, and (who) weakest in forces!" Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be punishment (in the world), or the Hour (of doom), they will know who is worse in position and who is weaker as an army. Say: As for him who remains in error, the Beneficent God will surely prolong his length of days, until they see what they were threatened with, either the punishment or the hour; then they shall know who is in more evil plight and weaker in forces. "And God doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return." God increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better for resort. And God increases in guidance those who go aright; and ever-abiding good works are with your Lord best in recompense and best in yielding fruit. Hast thou then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: "I shall certainly be given wealth and children?" Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children? Have you, then, seen him who disbelieves in Our communications and says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children? Has he penetrated to the Unseen, or has he taken a contract with (God) Most Gracious? Hath he perused the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent? Has he gained knowledge of the unseen, or made a covenant with the Beneficent God? Nay! We shall record what he says, and We""shall add and add to his punishment. Nay, but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of torment. By no means! We write down what he says, and We will lengthen to him the length of the chastisement. To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone. And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he will come unto Us, alone (without his wealth and children). And they have taken (for worship) gods other than God, to give them power and glory! And they have chosen (other) gods beside God that they may be a power for them. And they have taken gods besides God, that they should be to them a source of strength; Instead, they shall reject their worship, and become adversaries against them. Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them. By no means! They shall soon deny their worshipping them, and they shall be adversaries to them. Seest thou not that We have set the Evil Ones on against the unbelievers, to incite them with fury? Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion? Do you not see that We have sent the Shaitans against the unbelievers, inciting them by incitement? So make no haste against them, for We but count out to them a (limited) number (of days). So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto them a sum (of days). Therefore be not in haste against them, We only number out to them a number (of days). The day We shall gather the righteous to (God) Most Gracious, like a band presented before a king for honours, On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly company. The day on which We will gather those who guard (against evil) to the Beneficent God to receive honors, And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water,- And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd, And We will drive the guilty to hell thirsty. None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from (God) Most Gracious. They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a covenant with his Lord. They shall not control intercession, save he who has made a covenant with the Beneficent God. They say: "(God) Most Gracious has begotten a son!" And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. And they say: The Beneficent God has taken (to Himself) a son. Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous! Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing. Certainly you have made an abominable assertion. At it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin, Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins, The heavens may almost be rent thereat, and the earth cleave asunder, and the mountains fall down in pieces, That they should invoke a son for (God) Most Gracious. That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son, That they ascribe a son to the Beneficent God. For it is not consonant with the majesty of (God) Most Gracious that He should beget a son. When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should choose a son. And it is not worthy of the Beneficent God that He should take (to Himself) a son. Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (God) Most Gracious as a servant. There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave. There is no one in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Beneficent God as a servant. He does take an account of them (all), and hath numbered them (all) exactly. Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering. Certainly He has a comprehensive knowledge of them and He has numbered them a (comprehensive) numbering. And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment. And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone. And every one of them will come to Him on the day of resurrection alone. On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will (God) Most Gracious bestow love. Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for them love. Surely (as for) those who believe and do good deeds for them will God bring about love. So have We made the (Qur'an) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention. And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn therewith the froward folk. So We have only made it easy in your tongue that you may give good news thereby to those who guard (against evil) and warn thereby a vehemently contentious people. But how many (countless) generations before them have We destroyed? Canst thou find a single one of them (now) or hear (so much as) a whisper of them? And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound? And how many a generation have We destroyed before them! Do you see any one of them or hear a sound of them? - Chapter 20: TA-HA (TA-HA) Total Verses: 135 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Qur'an to thee to be (an occasion) for thy distress, We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur'an that thou shouldst be distressed, We have not revealed the Quran to you that you may be unsuccessful. But only as an admonition to those who fear (God),- But as a reminder unto him who feareth, Nay, it is a reminder to him who fears: A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the heavens on high. A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens, A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens. (God) Most Gracious is firmly established on the throne (of authority). The Beneficent One, Who is established on the Throne. The Beneficent God is firm in power. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and on earth, and all between them, and all beneath the soil. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is beneath the sod. His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and what is between them two and what is beneath the ground. If thou pronounce the word aloud, (it is no matter): for verily He knoweth what is secret and what is yet more hidden. And if thou speakest aloud, then lo! He knoweth the secret (thought) and (that which is yet) more hidden. And if you utter the saying aloud, then surely He knows the secret, and what is yet more hidden. God! there is no god but He! To Him belong the most Beautiful Names. God! There is no God save Him. His are the most beautiful names. God there is no god but He; His are the very best names. Has the story of Moses reached thee? Hath there come unto thee the story of Moses? And has the story of Musa come to you? Behold, he saw a fire: So he said to his family, "Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; perhaps I can bring you some burning brand therefrom, or find some guidance at the fire." When he saw a fire and said unto his folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off. Peradventure I may bring you a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire. When he saw fire, he said to his family: Stop, for surely I see a fire, haply I may bring to you therefrom a live coal or find a guidance at the fire. But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard: "O Moses!" And when he reached it, he was called by name: O Moses! So when he came to it, a voice was uttered: O Musa: "Verily I am thy Lord! therefore (in My presence) put off thy shoes: thou art in the sacred valley Tuwa." Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord. So take off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy valley of Tuwa. Surely I am your Lord, therefore put off your shoes; surely you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa, "I have chosen thee: listen, then, to the inspiration (sent to thee)." And I have chosen thee, so hearken unto that which is inspired. And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed: "Verily, I am God: There is no god but I: So serve thou Me (only), and establish regular prayer for celebrating My praise." Lo! I, even I, am God, There is no God save Me. So serve Me and establish worship for My remembrance. Surely I am God, there is no god but I, therefore serve Me and keep up prayer for My remembrance: "Verily the Hour is coming - My design is to keep it hidden - for every soul to receive its reward by the measure of its Endeavour." Lo! the Hour is surely coming. But I will to keep it hidden, that every soul may be rewarded for that which it striveth (to achieve). Surely the hour is coming I am about to make it manifest so that every soul may be rewarded as it strives: "Therefore let not such as believe not therein but follow their own lusts, divert thee therefrom, lest thou perish!" Therefore, let not him turn thee aside from (the thought of) it who believeth not therein but followeth his own desire, lest thou perish. Therefore let not him who believes not in it and follows his low desires turn you away from it so that you should perish; "And what is that in the right hand, O Moses?" And what is that in thy right hand, O Moses? And what is this in your right hand, O Musa! He said, "It is my rod: on it I lean; with it I beat down fodder for my flocks; and in it I find other uses." He said: This is my staff whereon I lean, and wherewith I bear down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses. He said: This is my staff: I recline on it and I beat the leaves with it to make them fall upon my sheep, and I have other uses for it. (God) said, "Throw it, O Moses!" He said: Cast it down, O Moses! He said: Cast it down, O Musa! He threw it, and behold! It was a snake, active in motion. So he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, gliding. So he cast it down; and lo! it was a serpent running. (God) said, "Seize it, and fear not: We shall return it at once to its former condition." He said: Grasp it and my exit by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and grant me from Thy Presence an authority to aid (me)." And say: "My Lord! Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out with a firm outgoing. And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power." And say: "Truth has arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is bound to perish." And say: "The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished; surely falsehood is a vanishing thing." We send down in the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe: to the unjust it causes nothing but loss after loss. And We reveal of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy for believers though it increases the evil-doers in naught save ruin. And when We bestow Our favours on man, he turns away and becomes remote on his side, and when evil seizes him he gives himself up to despair! And when We make life pleasant unto man, he turns away and is averse; and when ill touches him he is in despair. Say: "Everyone acts according to his own disposition: But your Lord knows best who it is that is best guided on the Way." Say: "The Spirit comes by command of my Lord: of knowledge it is only a little that is communicated to you." And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto thee, then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against Us in respect thereof. Except for Mercy from thy Lord: for His bounty is to thee indeed great. Say: "If the whole of mankind and jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up each other with help and support." And We have explained to man, in this Qur'an, every kind of similitude: yet the greater part of men refuse to receive it except with ingratitude! They say: "We shall not believe in thee, until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth," Or thou have a garden of date trees and vines, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst, carrying abundant water; Or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces, as thou sayest will happen, against us; or thou bring God and the angels before us face to face; Or thou have a house adorned with gold, or thou mount a ladder right into the skies. No, we shall not even believe in thy mounting until thou send down to us a book that we could read. Say: "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a man, a messenger?" What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them, was nothing but this: they said, "Has God sent a man like us to be His Messenger?" Say: "If there were settled, on earth, angels walking about in peace and quiet, We should certainly have sent them down from the heavens an angel for a messenger." Say: "Enough is God for a witness between me and you: for He is well acquainted with His servants, and He sees all things." It is he whom God guides, that is on true Guidance; but he whom He leaves astray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather them together, prone on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf: their abode will be Hell: every time it shows abatement, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire. That is their recompense, because they rejected Our signs, and said, "When we are reduced to bones and broken dust, should we really be raised up to be a new Creation?" See they not that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, has power to create the like of them anew? Only He has decreed a term appointed, of which there is no doubt. But the unjust refuse to receive it except with ingratitude. Say: "If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, behold, ye would keep them back, for fear of spending them: for man is ever niggardly!" To Moses We did give Nine Clear Signs: As the Children of Israel: when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him: "O Moses! I consider thee, indeed, to have been worked upon by sorcery!" Moses said, "Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence: and I consider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!"

"ely I believe you, O Firon, to be given over to perdition. 017.103 Y: So he resolved to remove them from the face of the earth: but We did drown him and all who were with him.

S: So he desired to destroy them out of the earth, but We drowned him and those with him all together; 017.104 Y: And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, "Dwell securely in the land (of promise)": but when the second of the warnings came to pass, We gathered you together in a mingled crowd. P: And We said unto the Children of Israel after him: Dwell in the land; but when the promise of the Hereafter cometh to pass We shall bring you as a crowd gathered out of various nations. S: And We said to the Israelites after him: Dwell in the land: and when the promise of the next life shall come to pass, we will bring you both together in judgment. 017.105 Y: We sent down the (Qur'an) in Truth, and in Truth has it descended: and We sent thee but to give Glad Tidings and to warn (sinners). P: With truth have We sent it down, and with truth hath it descended. And We have sent thee as naught else save a bearer of good tidings and a warner. S: And with truth have We revealed it, and with truth did it come; andWe have not sent you but as the giver of good news and as a warner. 017.106 Y: (It is) a Qur'an which We have divided (into parts from time to time), in order that thou mightest recite it to men at intervals: We have revealed it by stages. P: And (it is) a Qur'an that We have divided, that thou mayst recite it unto mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by (successive) revelation. S: And it is a Quran which We have revealed in portions so that you may read it to the people by slow degrees, and We have revealed it, revealing in portions. 017.107 Y: Say: "Whether ye believe in it or not, it is true that those who were given knowledge beforehand, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration," P: Say: Believe therein or believe not, lo! those who were given knowledge before it, when it is read unto them, fall down prostrate on their faces, adoring, S: Say: Believe in it or believe not; surely those who are given the knowledge before it fall down on their faces, making obeisance when it is recited to them. 017.108 Y: "And they say: 'Glory to our Lord! Truly has the promise of our Lord been fulfilled!'" P: Saying: Glory to our Lord! Verily the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled. S: And they say: Glory be to our Lord! most surely the promise of ourLord was to be fulfilled. 017.109 Y: They fall down on their faces in tears, and it increases their (earnest) humility. P: They fall down on their faces, weeping, and it increaseth humility in them. S: And they fall down on their faces weeping, and it adds to their humility. 017.110 Y: Say: "Call upon God, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call upon Him, (it is well): for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Neither speak thy Prayer aloud, nor speak it in a low tone, but seek a middle course between." P: Say (unto mankind): Cry unto God, or cry unto the Beneficent, unto whichsoever ye cry (it is the same). His are the most beautiful names. And thou (Muhammad), be not loud-voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein, but follow a way between. S: Say: Call upon God or call upon, the Beneficent God; whichever you call upon, He has the best names; and do not utter your prayer with a very raised voice nor be silent with regard to it, and seek a way between these. 017.111Y: Say: "Praise be to God, who begets no son, and has no partner in(His) dominion: Nor (needs) He any to protect Him from humiliation:yea, magnify Him for His greatness and glory!" P: And say: Praise be to God, Who hath not taken unto Himself a son, and Who hath no partner in the Sovereignty, nor hath He any protecting friend through dependence. And magnify Him with all magnificence. S: And say: (All) praise is due to God, Who has not taken a son andWho has not a partner in the kingdom, and Who has not a helper to saveHim from disgrace; and proclaim His greatness magnifying (Him). - Chapter 18: AL-KAHF (THE CAVE)Total Verses: 110 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 018.001 Y: Praise be to God, Who hath sent to His Servant the Book, and hath allowed therein no Crookedness: P: Praise be to God Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave, and hath not placed therein any crookedness, S: (All) praise is due to God, Who revealed the Book to His servant and did not make in it any crookedness. 018.002 Y: (He hath made it) Straight (and Clear) in order that He may warn (the godless) of a terrible Punishment from Him, and that He may give Glad Tidings to the Believers who work righteous deeds, that they shall have a goodly Reward, P: (But hath made it) straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him, and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a fair reward, S: Rightly directing, that he might give warning of severe punishment from Him and give good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a goodly reward, 018.003 Y: Wherein they shall remain for ever: P: Wherein they will abide for ever; S: Staying in it for ever; 018.004 Y: Further, that He may warn those (also) who say, "God hath begotten a son": P: And to warn those who say: God hath chosen a son, S: And warn those who say: God has taken a son. 018.005 Y: No knowledge have they of such a thing, nor had their fathers. It is a grievous thing that issues from their mouths as a saying what they say is nothing but falsehood! P: (A thing) whereof they have no knowledge, nor (had) their fathers, Dreadful is the word that cometh out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie. S: They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers; a grievous word it is that comes out of their mouths; they speak nothing but a lie. 018.006 Y: Thou wouldst only, perchance, fret thyself to death, following after them, in grief, if they believe not in this Message. P: Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement, that thou(Muhammad) wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps. S: Then maybe you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them, if they do not believe in this announcement. 018.007 Y: That which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for the earth, in order that We may test them - as to which of them are best in conduct. P: Lo! We have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that We may try them: which of them is best in conduct. S: Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment for it, so that We may try them (as to) which of them is best in works. 018.008 Y: Verily what is on earth we shall make but as dust and dry soil (without growth or herbage). P: And lo! We shall make all that is thereon a barren mound. S: And most surely We will make what is on it bare ground without herbage. 018.009Y: Or dost thou reflect that the Companions of the Cave and of theInscription were wonders among Our Sign? P: Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder among Our portents? S: Or, do you think that the Fellows of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our wonderful signs? 018.010Y: Behold, the youths betook themselves to the Cave: they said, "OurLord! bestow on us Mercy from Thyself, and dispose of our affair for usin the right way!" P: When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave and said: Our Lord! Give us mercy from Thy presence, and shape for us right conduct in our plight. S: When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they said: Our Lord! grant us mercy from Thee, and provide for us a right course in our affair. 018.011Y: Then We draw (a veil) over their ears, for a number of years, in theCave, (so that they heard not): P: Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years. S: So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years. 018.012 Y: Then We roused them, in order to test which of the two parties was best at calculating the term of years they had tarried! P: And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried. S: Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties was best able to compute the time for which they remained. 018.013 Y: We relate to thee their story in truth: they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We advanced them in guidance: P: We narrate unto thee their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. S: We relate to you their story with the truth; surely they were youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance. 018.014 Y: We gave strength to their hearts: Behold, they stood up and said: "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth: never shall we call upon any god other than Him: if we did, we should indeed have uttered an enormity!" P: And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto no God beside Him, for then should we utter an enormity. S: And We strengthened their hearts with patience, when they stood up and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will by no means call upon any god besides Him, for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing. 018.015 Y: "These our people have taken for worship gods other than Him: why do they not bring forward an authority clear (and convincing) for what they do? Who doth more wrong than such as invent a falsehood against God?" P: These, our people, have chosen (other) gods beside Him though they bring no clear warrant (vouchsafed) to them. And who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning God? S: These our people have taken gods besides Him; why do they not produce any clear authority in their support? Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against God? 018.016Y: "When ye turn away from them and the things they worship other thanGod, betake yourselves to the Cave: Your Lord will shower His mercieson you and disposes of your affair towards comfort and ease." P: And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship exceptGod, then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you ofHis mercy and will prepare for you a pillow in your plight. S: And when you forsake them and what they worship save God, betake yourselves for refuge to the cave; your Lord will extend to you largely of His mercy and provide for you a profitable course in your affair. 018.017 Y: Thou wouldst have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the open space in the midst of the Cave. Such are among the Signs of God: He whom God, guid"Fear not. We shall return it to its former state." He said: "Take hold of it and fear not; We will restore it to its former state."

"Now draw thy hand close to thy side: It shall come forth white (and shining), without harm (or stain), as another Sign,"- And thrust thy hand within thine armpit, it will come forth white without hurt. (That will be) another token.

"And press your hand to your side, it shall come out white without evil: another sign: That We may show thee (some) of Our greater portents, That We may show you of Our greater signs: Go thou to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds."

(Moses) said: "O my Lord! expand me my breast; And ease my task for me; And remove the impediment from my speech, So they may understand what I say: And give me a Minister from my family, Aaron, my brother; Add to my strength through him, And make him share my task: That we may celebrate Thy praise without stint, And remember Thee without stint: For Thou art He that (ever) regardeth us."

(God) said: "Granted is thy prayer, O Moses! And indeed We conferred a favour on thee another time (before). Behold! We sent to thy mother, by inspiration, the message: 'Throw (the child) into the chest, and throw (the chest) into the river: the river will cast him up on the bank, and he will be taken up by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him': But I cast (the garment of) love over thee from Me: and (this) in order that thou mayest be reared under Mine eye."

"When thy sister went and said: Shall I show you one who will nurse him? and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not sorrow. And thou didst kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress, and tried thee with a heavy trial. And thou didst tarry years among the folk of Midian. Then camest thou (hither) by (My) providence, O Moses, And I have chosen you for Myself: Go, thou and thy brother, with My Signs, and slacken not, either of you, in keeping Me in remembrance."

"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds; But speak to him mildly; perchance he may take warning or fear (God)."

They (Moses and Aaron) said: "Our Lord! We fear lest he hasten with insolence against us, or lest he transgress all bounds." He said: "Fear not: for I am with you: I hear and see (everything)."

"So go ye both to him, and say, 'Verily we are messengers sent by thy Lord: Send forth, therefore, the Children of Israel with us, and afflict them not: with a Sign, indeed, have we come from thy Lord! and peace to all who follow guidance!' Verily it has been revealed to us that the Penalty (awaits) those who reject and turn away."

(Pharaoh) said: "Who, then, O Moses, is the Lord of you two?" He said: "Our Lord is He Who gave to each (created) thing its form and nature, and further, gave (it) guidance." (Pharaoh) said: "What then is the condition of previous generations?" He replied: "The knowledge of that is with my Lord, duly recorded: my Lord never errs, nor forgets, He Who has made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabled you to go about therein by roads (and channels); and has sent down water from the sky."

With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate from the others. "Eat (for yourselves) and pasture your cattle: verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding. From the (earth) did We create you, and into it shall We return you, and from it shall We bring you out once again."

And We showed Pharaoh all Our Signs, but he did reject and refuse. He said: "Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic, O Moses?" "But we can surely produce magic to match thine! So make a tryst between us and thee, which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - in a place where both shall have even chances."

Moses said: "Your tryst is the Day of the Festival, and let the people be assembled when the sun is well up." So Pharaoh withdrew: He concerted his plan, and then came back.Moses said to them: "Woe to you! Do not forge a lie against God, lest He destroy you by a punishment, and he who forges a lie indeed fails to attain his desire." They debated among themselves and kept their counsel secret. They said: "These two are certainly magicians; their object is to drive you out from your land with their magic and to do away with your most cherished institutions." They decided to assemble in ranks, saying, "He who gains the upper hand today will be successful."

They said to Moses: "Will you cast, or shall we be the first to cast down?" Moses replied: "Nay, throw ye first!" Their ropes and rods, by their magic, appeared to him as though they were in lively motion. Moses conceived a fear in his mind, but God said: "Fear not! You have the upper hand. Throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have faked. The magician thrives not, no matter where he goes."

The magicians were thrown down to prostration, saying: "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses." Pharaoh said: "You believe in Him before I give you permission? Surely this must be your leader who has taught you magic! I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you on palm trees. You will know which of us can give the more severe and lasting punishment!" They replied: "We will never regard you as more than the Clear Signs that have come to us or than Him Who created us. Decree whatever you desire; you can only decree about this world's life."

They said: "We believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our faults and the magic to which you compelled us. God is Best and Most Abiding." Those who come to their Lord as sinners will face Hell, where they will neither die nor live. But those who come as believers with righteous deeds will have exalted ranks in Gardens of Eternity, beneath which rivers flow, where they will dwell forever. This is the reward for those who purify themselves.

God inspired Moses: "Travel by night with My servants and strike a dry path for them through the sea, without fear of being overtaken by Pharaoh." Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the waters overwhelmed them. Pharaoh led his people astray instead of guiding them.

God said: "O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, made a covenant with you on the right side of Mount Sinai, and sent down Manna and quails. Eat of the good things We have provided, but commit no excess therein, lest My Wrath descend on you. Those on whom My Wrath descends perish indeed. But I am He who forgives again and again to those who repent, believe, and do right, who are ready to receive true guidance."

When Moses was on the Mount, God said: "What made you hasten in advance of your people, O Moses?" Moses replied: "They are close on my footsteps; I hastened to You, O my Lord, to please You." God said: "We have tested your people in your absence; the Samiri has led them astray." Moses returned to his people in indignation and sorrow, saying: "O my people! Did not your Lord make a handsome promise to you? Did the promise seem long in coming? Or did you desire that Wrath should descend from your Lord on you, and so you broke your promise to me?

P: And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft thereof. That was (one) of the portents of God. He whom God guideth, he indeed is led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend. S: And you might see the sun when it rose, decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set, leave them behind on the left while they were in a wide space thereof. This is of the signs of God; whomsoever God guides, he is the rightly guided one, and whomsoever He causes to err, you shall not find for him any friend to lead (him) aright. 018.018 Y: Thou wouldst have deemed them awake, whilst they were asleep, and We turned them on their right and on their left sides: their dog stretching forth his two fore-legs on the threshold: if thou hadst come up on to them, thou wouldst have certainly turned back from them in flight, and wouldst certainly have been filled with terror of them. P: And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and We caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them. S: And you might think them awake while they were asleep and We turned them about to the right and to the left, while their dog (lay) outstretching its paws at the entrance; if you looked at them you would certainly turn back from them in flight, and you would certainly be filled with awe because of them. 018.019 Y: Such (being their state), we raised them up (from sleep), that they might question each other. Said one of them, "How long have ye stayed (here)?" They said, "We have stayed (perhaps) a day, or part of a day." (At length) they (all) said, "God (alone) knows best how long ye have stayed here. Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours to the town: let him find out which is the best food (to be had) and bring some to you, that (ye may) satisfy your hunger therewith: And let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform any one about you." P: And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried? They said: We have tarried a day or some part of a day, (Others) said: Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous and let no man know of you. S: And thus did We rouse them that they might question each other. A speaker among them said: How long have you tarried? They said: We have tarried for a day or a part of a day. (Others) said: Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city, then let him see which of them has purest food, so let him bring you provision from it, and let him behave with gentleness, and by no means make your case known to any one: 018.020 Y: "For if they should come upon you, they would stone you or force you to return to their cult, and in that case ye would never attain prosperity." P: For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you back to their religion; then ye will never prosper. S: For surely if they prevail against you they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed. 018.021 Y: Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said, "Construct a building over them": Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, "Let us surely build a place of worship over them." P: And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of worship over them. S: And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they might know that God's promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it. When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice over them their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said: We will certainly raise a masjid over them. 018.022 Y: (Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; (others) say they were five, the dog being the sixth,- doubtfully guessing at the unknown; (yet others) say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say thou: "My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their (real case)." Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about (the affair of) the Sleepers. P: (Some) will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and (some) say: Five, their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and (some) say: Seven, and their dog the eighth. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None knoweth them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending, and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them. S: (Some) say: (They are) three, the fourth of them being their dog; and (others) say: Five, the sixth of them being their dog, making conjectures at what is unknown; and (others yet) say: Seven, and the eighth of them is their dog. Say: My Lord best knows their number, none knows them but a few; therefore contend not in the matter of them but with an outward contention, and do not question concerning them any of them. 018.023 Y: Nor say of anything, "I shall be sure to do so and so tomorrow"- P: And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow, S: And do not say of anything: Surely I will do it tomorrow, 018.024 Y: Without adding, "So please God!" and call thy Lord to mind when thou forgettest, and say, "I hope that my Lord will guide me ever closer (even) than this to the right road." P: Except if God will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say: It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this. S: Unless God pleases; and remember your Lord when you forget and say: Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer course to the right than this. 018.025 Y: So they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, and (some) add nine (more) P: And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine. S: And they remained in their cave three hundred years and (some) add (another) nine. 018.026 Y: Say: "God knows best how long they stayed: with Him is (the knowledge of) the secrets of the heavens and the earth: how clearly He sees, how finely He hears (everything)! They have no protector other than Him; nor does He share His Command with any person whatsoever." P: Say: God is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no protecting friend beside Him, and He maketh none to share in His government. S: Say: God knows best how long they remained; to Him are (known) the unseen things of the heavens and the earth; how clear His sight and how clear His hearing! There is none to be a guardian for them besides Him, and He does not make any one His associate in His Judgment. 018.027 Y: And recite (and teach) what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord: none can change His Words, and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than Him. P: And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him. S: And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord, there is none who can alter His words; and you shall not find any refuge besides Him. 018.028 Y: And keep thy soul content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face; and let not thine eyes pass beyond them, seeking the pomp and glitter of this Life; no obey any whose heart We have permitted to neglect the remembrance of Us, one who follows his own desires, whose case has gone beyond all bounds. P: Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been abandoned. S: And withhold yourself with those who call on their Lord morning and evening desiring His goodwill, and let not your eyes pass from them, desiring the beauties of this world's life; and do not follow him whose heart We have made unmindful to Our remembrance, and he follows his low desires and his case is one in which due bounds are exceeded. 018.029 Y: Say, "The truth is from your Lord": Let him who will believe, and let him who will, reject (it): for the wrong-doers We have prepared a Fire whose (smoke and flames), like the walls and roof of a tent, will hem them in: if they implore relief they will be granted water like melted brass, that will scald their faces, how dreadful the drink! How uncomfortable a couch to recline on! P: Say: (It is) the truth from the Lord of you (all). Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloseth them. If they ask for showers, they will be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting-place! S: And say: The truth is from your Lord, so let him who please believe, and let him who please disbelieve; surely We have prepared for the iniquitous a fire, the curtains of which shall encompass them about; and if they cry for water, they shall be given water like molten brass which will scald their faces; evil the drink and ill the resting-place. 018.030 Y: As to those who believe and work righteousness, verily We shall not suffer to perish the reward of any who do a (single) righteous deed. P: Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost. S: Surely (as for) those who believe and do good, We do not waste the reward of him who does a good work. 018.031 Y: For them will be Gardens of Eternity; beneath them rivers will flow; they will be adorned therein with bracelets of go"They said: "We broke not the promise to you, as far as lay in our power: but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the people, and we threw them into the fire, and that was what the Samiri suggested." Then he brought out before the people the image of a calf: it seemed to low, so they said: "This is your god, and the god of Moses, but Moses has forgotten!" Could they not see that it could not return them a word, and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good?

Aaron had already said to them: "O my people! You are being tested in this: for verily your Lord is God Most Gracious; so follow me and obey my command." They said: "We will not abandon this cult, but we will devote ourselves to it until Moses returns to us." Moses said: "O Aaron! What kept you back, when you saw them going wrong, from following me? Did you then disobey my order?" Aaron replied: "O son of my mother! Seize me not by my beard nor by my head! Truly I feared lest you should say, 'You have caused a division among the children of Israel, and you did not respect my word!'"

Moses said: "What then is your case, O Samiri?" He replied: "I saw what they saw not: so I took a handful of dust from the footprint of the Messenger, and threw it into the calf: thus did my soul suggest to me." Moses said: "Get away! But your punishment in this life will be that you will say, 'Touch me not'; and moreover, you have a promise that will not fail: Now look at your god, of whom you have become a devoted worshipper: We will certainly melt it in a blazing fire and scatter it in the sea!"

But the god of you all is the One God: there is no god but He: all things He comprehends in His knowledge. Thus do We relate to you some stories of what happened before: for We have sent you a Message from Our own Presence. If any turn away therefrom, they will bear a burden on the Day of Judgment; they will abide in this state, and grievous will the burden be to them on that Day. The Day when the Trumpet will be sounded: that Day, We shall gather the sinful, blear-eyed with terror. In whispers, they will consult each other: "You tarried not longer than ten days." We know best what they will say, when their leader most eminent in conduct will say: "You tarried not longer than a day!"

They ask you concerning the mountains: say, "My Lord will uproot them and scatter them as dust; He will leave them as plains smooth and level; nothing crooked or curved will you see in their place." On that Day, they will follow the Caller straight: no crookedness can they show him: all sounds shall humble themselves in the Presence of God Most Gracious: nothing will you hear but the tramp of their feet as they march. On that Day, no intercession will avail except for those for whom permission has been granted by God Most Gracious and whose word is acceptable to Him. He knows what appears to His creatures as before or after or behind them, but they shall not compass it with their knowledge.

All faces shall be humbled before Him - the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal: hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity on his back. But he who works deeds of righteousness, and has faith, will have no fear of harm nor of any curtailment of what is his due. Thus have We sent this down - an Arabic Qur'an - and explained therein in detail some of the warnings, in order that they may fear God, or that it may cause their remembrance of Him. High above all is God, the King, the Truth! Be not in haste with the Qur'an before its revelation to you is completed, but say, "O my Lord! Advance me in knowledge.""the King, the Truth, and do not make haste with the Quran before its revelation is made complete to you and say: O my Lord! increase me in knowledge. 020.115 We had already, beforehand, taken the covenant of Adam, but he forgot: and We found on his part no firm resolve. 020.116 When We said to the angels, 'Prostrate yourselves to Adam,' they prostrated themselves, but not Iblis: he refused. 020.117 Then We said: 'O Adam! verily, this is an enemy to you and your wife: so let him not get you both out of the Garden, so that you are landed in misery.' 020.118 'There is therein (enough provision) for you not to go hungry nor to go naked,' 020.119 'Nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the sun's heat.' 020.120 But Satan whispered evil to him: he said, 'O Adam! shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?' 020.121 In the result, they both ate of the tree, and so their nakedness appeared to them: they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden: thus did Adam disobey his Lord, and allow himself to be seduced. 020.122 But his Lord chose him (for His Grace): He turned to him, and gave him Guidance. 020.123 He said: 'Get down, both of you, all together, from the Garden, with enmity one to another: but if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from Me, whosoever follows My Guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall into misery.' 020.124 'But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a life narrowed down, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment.' 020.125 He will say: 'O my Lord! why have You raised me up blind, while I had sight (before)?' 020.126 (God) will say: 'Thus did you, when Our Signs came unto you, disregard them: so will you, this day, be disregarded.' 020.127 And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes not in the Signs of his Lord: and the Penalty of the Hereafter is far more grievous and more enduring. 020.128 Is it not a warning to such men (to call to mind) how many generations before them We destroyed, in whose haunts they (now) move? Verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding. 020.129 Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, (their punishment) must necessarily have come; but there is a Term appointed (for respite). 020.130 Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate (constantly) the praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun, and before its setting; celebrate them for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day: that you may have (spiritual) joy. 020.131 Nor strain your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to parties of them, the splendor of the life of this world, through which We test them: but the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring. 020.132 Enjoin prayer on your people, and be constant therein. We ask you not to provide sustenance: We provide it for you. But the (fruit of) the Hereafter is for righteousness. 020.133 They say: 'Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?' Has not a Clear Sign come to them of all that was in the former Books of revelation? 020.134 And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this, they would have said: 'Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we should certainly have followed Your Signs before we were humbled and put to shame.' 020.135 Say: 'Each one (of us) is waiting: wait, therefore, and soon shall you know who it is that is on the straight and even way, and who it is that has received Guidance.' - Chapter 21: AL-ANBIYA (THE PROPHETS) Total Verses: 112 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 021.001 Closer and closer to mankind comes their Reckoning: yet they heed not and they turn away. 021.002 Never comes (aught) to them of a renewed Message from their Lord, but they listen to it as in jest, 021.003 Their hearts toying as with trifles. The wrong-doers conceal their private counsels, (saying), 'Is this (one) more than a man like yourselves? Will you go to witchcraft with your eyes open?'""Is other than a mortal like you? Will you then succumb to magic when you see it?" Their hearts trifling; and those who are unjust counsel together in secret: "He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves; what! will you then yield to enchantment while you see?" Say: "My Lord knows every word spoken in the heavens and on earth: He is the One that hears and knows all things." He said: "My Lord knows what is spoken in the heaven and the earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing." They say, "These are medleys of dreams! - Nay, He forged it! - Nay, He is but a poet! Let him then bring us a Sign like the ones that were sent to Prophets of old!" Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though We sent them portents): would they then believe? Before you, also, the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We granted inspiration: If you realize this not, ask those who possess the Message. We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals. In the end, We fulfilled to them Our Promise, and We saved them and those whom We pleased, but We destroyed those who transgressed beyond bounds. We have revealed for you a book in which is a Message for you: will you not then understand? How many were the populations We utterly destroyed because of their iniquities, setting up in their places other peoples? Yet, when they felt Our Punishment coming, behold, they tried to flee from it. Flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given to you, and to your homes in order that you may be called to account. They said: "Ah! woe to us! We were indeed wrong-doers!" And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is mown, as ashes silent and quenched. Not for idle sport did We create the heavens and the earth and all that is between! If it had been Our wish to take a pastime, We should surely have taken it from the things nearest to Us, if We would do such a thing! Nay, We hurl the Truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its brain, and behold, falsehood perishes! Ah! woe be to you for the false things you ascribe to Us. To Him belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth: Even those who are in His very Presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor are they ever weary of His service. They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever flag or intermit. Or have they taken for worship gods from the earth who can raise the dead? If there were, in the heavens and the earth, other gods besides God, there would have been confusion in both! But glory to God, the Lord of the Throne: High is He above what they attribute to Him! He cannot be questioned for His acts, but they will be questioned for theirs. Or have they taken for worship other gods besides Him? Say, "Bring your convincing proof: this is the Message of those with me and the Message of those before me." But most of them know not the Truth, and so turn away. Not a messenger did We send before you without this inspiration sent by Us to him: that there is no god but I; therefore worship and serve Me. And they say: "God Most Gracious has begotten offspring." Glory to Him! They are but servants raised to honor. They speak not before He speaks, and they act in all things by His Command. He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they offer no intercession except for those who are acceptable, and they stand in awe and reverence of His Glory. If any of them should say, "I am a god besides Him," such a one We should reward with Hell: thus do We reward those who do wrong. Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit of creation, before We clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? And We have set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with them, and We have made therein broad highways for them to pass through: that they may receive Guidance. And We have made the heavens as a canopy well guarded: yet do they turn away from the Signs which these things point to!ld, and they will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade: They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good the recompense! How beautiful a couch to recline on! P: As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon thrones therein. Blest the reward, and fair the resting-place! S: These it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow, ornaments shall be given to them therein of bracelets of gold, and they shall wear green robes of fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold, reclining therein on raised couches; excellent the recompense and goodly the resting place. 018.032 Y: Set forth to them the parable of two men: for one of them We provided two gardens of grape-vines and surrounded them with date palms; in between the two We placed corn-fields. P: Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put between them tillage. S: And set forth to them a parable of two men; for one of them We made two gardens of grape vines, and We surrounded them both with palms, and in the midst of them We made cornfields. 018.033 Y: Each of those gardens brought forth its produce, and failed not in the least therein: in the midst of them We caused a river to flow. P: Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein. S: Both these gardens yielded their fruits, and failed not aught thereof, and We caused a river to gush forth in their midst, 018.034 Y: (Abundant) was the produce this man had: he said to his companion, in the course of a mutual argument: "more wealth have I than you, and more honour and power in (my following of) men." P: And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men. S: And he possessed much wealth; so he said to his companion, while he disputed with him: I have greater wealth than you, and am mightier in followers. 018.035 Y: He went into his garden in a state (of mind) unjust to his soul: He said, "I deem not that this will ever perish," P: And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself. He said: I think not that all this will ever perish. S: And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said: I do not think that this will ever perish, 018.036 Y: "Nor do I deem that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) come: Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I shall surely find (there) something better in exchange." P: I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort. S: And I do not think the hour will come, and even if I am returned to my Lord I will most certainly find a returning place better than this. 018.037 Y: His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him: "Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man?" P: His comrade, when he (thus) spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop (of seed), and then fashioned thee a man? S: His companion said to him while disputing with him: Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust, then from a small seed, then He made you a perfect man? 018.038 Y: "But (I think) for my part that He is God, My Lord, and none shall I associate with my Lord." P: But He is God, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner. S: But as for me, He, God, is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord. 018.039 Y: "Why didst thou not, as thou wentest into thy garden, say: 'God's will (be done)! There is no power but with God!' If thou dost see me less than thee in wealth and sons," P: If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which God willeth (will come to pass)! There is no strength save in God! Though thou seest me as less than thee in wealth and children, S: And wherefore did you not say when you entered your garden: It is as God has pleased, there is no power save in God? If you consider me to be inferior to you in wealth and children, 018.040 Y: "It may be that my Lord will give me something better than thy garden, and that He will send on thy garden thunderbolts (by way of reckoning) from heaven, making it (but) slippery sand!" P: Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside, S: Then maybe my Lord will give me what is better than your garden, and send on it a thunderbolt from heaven so that it shall become even ground without plant, 018.041 Y: "Or the water of the garden will run off underground so that thou wilt never be able to find it." P: Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it. S: Or its waters should sink down into the ground so that you are unable to find it. 018.042 Y: So his fruits (and enjoyment) were encompassed (with ruin), and he remained twisting and turning his hands over what he had spent on his property, which had (now) tumbled to pieces to its very foundations, and he could only say, "Woe is me! Would I had never ascribed partners to my Lord and Cherisher!" P: And his fruit was beset (with destruction). Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent upon it, when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord! S: And his wealth was destroyed; so he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it, while it lay, having fallen down upon its roofs, and he said: Ah me! would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord. 018.043 Y: Nor had he numbers to help him against God, nor was he able to deliver himself. P: And he had no troop of men to help him as against God, nor could he save himself. S: And he had no host to help him besides God nor could he defend himself. 018.044 Y: There, the (only) protection comes from God, the True One. He is the Best to reward, and the Best to give success. P: In this case is protection only from God, the True, He is Best for reward, and best for consequence. S: Here is protection only God's, the True One; He is best in (the giving of) reward and best in requiting. 018.045 Y: Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the rain which we send down from the skies: the earth's vegetation absorbs it, but soon it becomes dry stubble, which the winds do scatter: it is (only) God who prevails over all things. P: And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. God is able to do all things. S: And set forth to them parable of the life of this world: like water which We send down from the cloud so the herbage of the earth becomes tangled on account of it, then it becomes dry broken into pieces which the winds scatter; and God is the holder of power over all things. 018.046 Y: Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world: But the things that endure, good deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best as (the foundation for) hopes. P: Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in respect of hope. S: Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world; and the ever-abiding, the good works, are better with your Lord in reward and better in expectation. 018.047 Y: One Day We shall remove the mountains, and thou wilt see the earth as a level stretch, and We shall gather them, all together, nor shall We leave out any one of them. P: And (bethink you of) the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind. S: And the day on which We will cause the mountains to pass away and you will see the earth a levelled plain and We will gather them and leave not any one of them behind. 018.048 Y: And they will be marshalled before thy Lord in ranks, (with the announcement), "Now have ye come to Us (bare) as We created you first: aye, ye thought We shall not fulfill the appointment made to you to meet (Us)!" P: And they are set before thy Lord in ranks (and it is said unto them): Now verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that We had set no tryst for you. S: And they shall be brought before your Lord, standing in ranks: Now certainly you have come to Us as We created you at first. Nay, you thought that We had not appointed to you a time of the fulfillment of the promise. 018.049 Y: And the Book (of Deeds) will be placed (before you); and thou wilt see the sinful in great terror because of what is (recorded) therein; they will say, "Ah! woe to us! what a Book is this! It leaves out nothing small or great, but takes account thereof!" They will find all that they did, placed before them: And not one will thy Lord treat with injustice. P: And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did confronting them, and thy Lord wrongeth no-one. S: And the Book shall be placed, then you will see the guilty fearing from what is in it, and they will say: Ah! woe to us! what a book is this! it does not omit a small one nor a great one, but numbers them (all); and what they had done they shall find present (there); and your Lord does not deal unjustly with anyone. 018.050 Y: Behold! We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam": They bowed down except Iblis. He was one of the jinns, and he broke the Command of his Lord. Will ye then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me? And they are enemies to you! Evil would be the exchange for the wrong-doers! P: And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord's command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of Me, when they are an enemy unto you? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers. S: And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam; they made obeisance but Iblis (did it not). He was of the jinn, so he transgressed the commandment of his Lord. What! would you then take him and his offspring for friends rather than Me, and they are your enemies? Evil is (this) change for the unjust. 018.051 Y: I called them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (even) their own creation: nor is it for helpeAnd We have made the heaven a guarded canopy and yet they turn aside from its signs. It is He Who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: all the celestial bodies swim along, each in its rounded course. We granted not to any man before thee permanent life: if then thou shouldst die, would they live permanently? Every soul shall have a taste of death: And We test you by evil and by good by way of trial: To Us must ye return. When the Unbelievers see thee, they treat thee not except with ridicule. "Is this," they say, "the one who talks of your gods?" and they blaspheme at the mention of God Most Gracious! Man is a creature of haste: soon enough will I show you My Signs; then ye will not ask Me to hasten them! They say: "When will this promise come to pass, if ye are telling the truth?" If only the Unbelievers knew the time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor yet from their backs, and when no help can reach them! Nay, it may come to them all of a sudden and confound them: no power will they have then to avert it, nor will they then get respite. Mocked were many messengers before thee; But their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked. Say: "Who can keep you safe by night and by day from the Wrath of God Most Gracious?" Yet they turn away from the mention of their Lord. Or have they gods that can guard them from Us? They have no power to aid themselves, nor can they be defended from Us. Nay, We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land in their control from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win? Say, "I do but warn you according to revelation": But the deaf will not hear the call, even when they are warned! If but a breath of the Wrath of thy Lord do touch them, they will then say, "Woe to us! we did wrong indeed!" We shall set up scales of justice for the Day of Judgment, so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least, and if there be no more than the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it to account: and enough are We to take account. In the past We granted to Moses and Aaron the criterion for judgment, and a Light and a Message for those who would do right. Those who fear their Lord in their most secret thoughts, and who hold the Hour of Judgment in awe. And this is a blessed Message which We have sent down: will ye then reject it? We bestowed aforetime on Abraham his rectitude of conduct, and well were We acquainted with him. Behold! he said to his father and his people, "What are these images, to which ye are so assiduously devoted?" They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them." He said, "Indeed ye have been in manifest error - ye and your fathers." They said, "Have you brought us the Truth, or are you one of those who jest?" He said, "Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, He Who created them from nothing: and I am a witness to this Truth." "And by God, I have a plan for your idols - after ye go away and turn your backs." So he broke them to pieces, all but the biggest of them, that they might turn and address themselves to it. They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He must indeed be some man of impiety!" They said, "We heard a youth talk of them: He is called Abraham." They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness." They said, "Art thou the one that did this with our gods, O Abraham?" He said, "Nay, this was done by - this is their biggest one! ask them, if they can speak intelligently!" So they turned to themselves and said, "Surely ye are the ones in the wrong!"I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of the creation of their own souls; nor could I take those who lead others astray for aiders. One Day He will say, "Call on those whom you thought to be My partners," and they will call on them, but they will not listen to them; and We shall make for them a place of common perdition. And the Sinful shall see the fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein: no means will they find to turn away therefrom. We have explained in detail in this Qur'an, for the benefit of mankind, every kind of similitude: but man is, in most things, contentious. And what is there to keep back men from believing, now that Guidance has come to them, nor from praying for forgiveness from their Lord, but that they ask that the ways of the ancients be repeated with them, or the Wrath be brought to them face to face? We only send the messengers to give Glad Tidings and to give warnings: But the unbelievers dispute with vain argument, in order therewith to weaken the truth, and they treat My Signs as a jest, as also the fact that they are warned! And who does more wrong than one who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting the deeds which his hands have sent forth? Verily We have set veils over their hearts lest they should understand this, and over their ears, deafness, if you call them to guidance, even then will they never accept guidance. But your Lord is Most Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to call them at once to account for what they have earned, then surely He would have hastened their punishment: but they have their appointed time, beyond which they will find no refuge. Such were the populations we destroyed when they committed iniquities; but we fixed an appointed time for their destruction. Behold, Moses said to his attendant, "I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or until I spend years and years in travel." But when they reached the Junction, they forgot about their Fish, which took its course through the sea straight as in a tunnel. When they had passed on some distance, Moses said to his attendant: "Bring us our early meal; truly we have suffered much fatigue at this stage of our journey." He replied: "Sawest thou what happened when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget about the Fish: none but Satan made me forget to tell you about it: it took its course through the sea in a marvellous way!" Moses said: "That was what we were seeking after:" So they went back on their footsteps, following the path they had come. So they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves and whom We had taught knowledge from Our own Presence. Moses said to him: "May I follow you, on the footing that you teach me something of the Higher Truth which you have been taught?" He said: "Verily you will not be able to have patience with me!" "And how can you have patience about things about which your understanding is not complete?" Moses said: "You will find me, if God so will, truly patient: nor shall I disobey you in aught." The other said: "If then you would follow me, ask me no questions about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it." So they both proceeded: until, when they were in the boat, he scuttled it. Said Moses: "Have you scuttled it in order to drown those in it? Truly a strange thing you have done!" He answered: "Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?" Moses said: "Rebuke me not for forgetting, nor grieve me by raising difficulties in my case." Then they proceeded: until, when they met a young man, he slew him. Moses said: "Have you slain an innocent person who had slain none? Truly a foul thing you have done!"soul who hath slain no man? Verily thou hast done a horrid thing." 

So they went on until, when they met a boy, he slew him. (Musa) said: "Have you slain an innocent person otherwise than for manslaughter? Certainly you have done an evil thing." 

He answered: "Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me?" 

(Moses) said: "If ever I ask thee about anything after this, keep me not in thy company: then wouldst thou have received (full) excuse from my side." 

Then they proceeded: until, when they came to the inhabitants of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused them hospitality. They found there a wall on the point of falling down, but he set it up straight. (Moses) said: "If thou hadst wished, surely thou couldst have exacted some recompense for it!" 

He answered: "This is the parting between me and thee: now will I tell thee the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience. 

As for the boat, it belonged to certain men in dire want: they plied on the water: I but wished to render it unserviceable, for there was after them a certain king who seized on every boat by force. 

As for the youth, his parents were people of Faith, and we feared that he would grieve them by obstinate rebellion and ingratitude (to God and man). 

So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange (a son) better in purity (of conduct) and closer in affection. 

As for the wall, it belonged to two youths, orphans, in the town; there was, beneath it, a buried treasure, to which they were entitled: their father had been a righteous man: So thy Lord desired that they should attain their age of full strength and get out their treasure - a mercy (and favour) from thy Lord. I did it not of my own accord. Such is the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold patience." 

They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain. Say, "I will rehearse to you something of his story." 

Verily We established his power on earth, and We gave him the ways and the means to all ends. 

One (such) way he followed, until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water: Near it he found a People: We said: "O Zul-qarnain! (thou hast authority,) either to punish them, or to treat them with kindness." 

He said: "Whoever doth wrong, him shall we punish; then shall he be sent back to his Lord; and He will punish him with a punishment unheard-of (before). 

But whoever believes, and works righteousness,- he shall have a goodly reward, and easy will be his task as We order it by our Command." 

Then followed he (another) way, until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no covering protection against the sun. 

(He left them) as they were: We completely understood what was before him. 

Then followed he (another) way, until, when he reached (a tract) between two mountains, he found, beneath them, a people who scarcely understood a word. 

They said: "O Zul-qarnain! the Gog and Magog (People) do great mischief on earth: shall we then render thee tribute in order that thou mightest erect a barrier between us and them?" 

He said: "(The power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than tribute): Help me therefore with strength (and labour): I will erect a strong barrier between you and them." 

"Bring me blocks of iron." At length, when he had filled up the space between the two steep mountain-sides, He said, "Blow (with your bellows)." Then, when he had made it (red) as fire, he said: "Bring me, that I may pour over it, molten lead." 

Thus were they made powerless to scale it or to dig through it. 

He said: "This is a mercy from my Lord: But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it into dust; and the promise of my Lord is true." 

On that day We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another: the trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them all together.Then they turned to themselves and said: Surely you yourselves are the unjust. Then they were confounded with shame: (they said), "Thou knowest full well that these (idols) do not speak!" And they were utterly confounded, and they said: Well thou knowest that these speak not. Then they were made to hang down their heads: Certainly you know that they do not speak. (Abraham) said, "Do ye then worship, besides God, things that can neither be of any good to you nor do you harm?" He said: Worship ye then instead of God that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you? He said: What! do you then serve besides God what brings you not any benefit at all, nor does it harm you? "Fie upon you, and upon the things that ye worship besides God! Have ye no sense?" Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of God! Have ye then no sense? Fie on you and on what you serve besides God; what! do you not then understand? They said, "Burn him and protect your gods, if ye do (anything at all)!" They cried: Burn him and stand by your gods, if ye will be doing. They said: Burn him and help your gods, if you are going to do (anything). We said, "O Fire! be thou cool, and (a means of) safety for Abraham!" We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham, We said: O fire! be a comfort and peace to Ibrahim; Then they sought a stratagem against him: but We made them the ones that lost most! And they wished to set a snare for him, but We made them the greater losers. And they desired a war on him, but We made them the greatest losers. But We delivered him and (his nephew) Lut (and directed them) to the land which We have blessed for the nations. And We rescued him and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We have blessed for (all) peoples. And We delivered him as well as Lut (removing them) to the land which We had blessed for all people. And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them). And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and Jacob as a grandson. Each of them We made righteous. And We gave him Ishaq and Yaqoub, a son's son, and We made (them) all good. And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practise regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only). And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command, and We inspired in them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of alms, and they were worshippers of Us (alone). And We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the alms, and Us (alone) did they serve; And to Lut, too, We gave Judgment and Knowledge, and We saved him from the town which practised abominations: truly they were a people given to Evil, a rebellious people. And unto Lot we gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from the community that did abominations. Lo! they were folk of evil, lewd. And (as for) Lut, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town which wrought abominations; surely they were an evil people, transgressors; And We admitted him to Our Mercy: for he was one of the Righteous. And We brought him in unto Our mercy. Lo! he was of the righteous. And We took him into Our mercy; surely he was of the good. (Remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime: We listened to his (prayer) and delivered him and his family from great distress. And Noah, when he cried of old, We heard his prayer and saved him and his household from the great affliction. And Nuh, when he cried aforetime, so We answered him, and delivered him and his followers from the great calamity. We helped him against people who rejected Our Signs: truly they were a people given to Evil: so We drowned them (in the Flood) all together. And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations. Lo! they were folk of evil, therefore did We drown them all. And We helped him against the people who rejected Our communications; surely they were an evil people, so We drowned them all. And remember David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the matter of the field into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night: We did witness their judgment. And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when people's sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night; and We were witnesses to their judgment. And Dawood and Sulaiman when they gave judgment concerning the field when the people's sheep pastured therein by night, and We were bearers of witness to their judgment. To Solomon We inspired the (right) understanding of the matter: to each (of them) We gave Judgment and Knowledge; it was Our power that made the hills and the birds celebrate Our praises, with David: it was We Who did (all these things). And We made Solomon to understand (the case); and unto each of them We gave judgment and knowledge. And we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn (His) praise along with David. We were the doers (thereof). So We made Sulaiman to understand it; and to each one We gave wisdom and knowledge; and We made the mountains, and the birds to celebrate Our praise with Dawood; and We were the doers. It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit, to guard you from each other's violence: will ye then be grateful? And We taught him the art of making garments (of mail) to protect you in your daring. Are ye then thankful? And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, that they might protect you in your wars; will you then be grateful? (It was Our power that made) the violent (unruly) wind flow (tamely) for Solomon, to his order, to the land which We had blessed: for We do know all things. And unto Solomon (We subdued) the wind in its raging. It set by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And of everything We are Aware. And (We made subservient) to Sulaiman the wind blowing violent, pursuing its course by his command to the land which We had blessed, and We are knower of all things. And of the evil ones, were some who dived for him, and did other work besides; and it was We Who guarded them. And of the evil ones (subdued We unto him) some who dived (for pearls) for him and did other work, and We were warders unto them. And of the rebellious people there were those who dived for him and did other work besides that, and We kept guard over them; And (remember) Job, when He cried to his Lord, "Truly distress has seized me, but Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful." And Job, when he cried unto his Lord, (saying): Lo! adversity afflicteth me, and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy. And Ayub, when he cried to his Lord, (saying): Harm has afflicted me, and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful. So We listened to him: We removed the distress that was on him, and We restored his people to him, and doubled their number,- as a Grace from Ourselves, and a thing for commemoration, for all who serve Us. Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he suffered, and We gave him his household (that he had lost) and the like thereof along with them, a mercy from Our store, and a remembrance for the worshippers; Therefore We responded to him and took off what harm he had, and We gave him his family and the like of them with them: a mercy from Us and a reminder to the worshippers. And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Zul-kifl, all (men) of constancy and patience; And (mention) Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhu'l-Kifl. All were of the steadfast. And Ismail and Idris and Zulkifl; all were of the patient ones; We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones. And We brought them in unto Our mercy. Lo! they are among the righteous. And We caused them to enter into Our mercy, surely they were of the good ones. And remember Zun-nun, when he departed in wrath: He imagined that We had no power over him! But he cried through the depths of darkness, "There is no god but Thou: glory to Thee: I was indeed wrong!" And (mention) Dhu'n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no God save Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer. And Yunus, when he went away in wrath, so he thought that We would not straiten him, so he called out among afflictions: There is no god but Thou, glory be to Thee; surely I am of those who make themselves to suffer loss. So We listened to him: and delivered him from distress: and thus do We deliver those who have faith. Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save believers. So We responded to him and delivered him from the grief and thus do We deliver the believers. And (remember) Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: "O my Lord! leave me not without offspring, though thou art the best of inheritors." And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors. And Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: O my Lord leave me not alone; and Thou art the best of inheritors. So We listened to him: and We granted him Yahya: We cured his wife's (Barrenness) for him. These (three) were ever quick in emulation in good works; they used to call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves before Us. Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds, and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us. So We responded to him and gave him Yahya and made his wife fit for him; surely they used to hasten, one with another, in deeds of goodness and to call upon Us, hoping and fearing; and they were humble before Us. And (remember) her who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Our spirit, and We made her and her son a sign for all peoples. And she who was chaste, therefore We breathed into her (something) of Our Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples. And she who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her of Our inspiration and made her and her son a sign for the nations. Verily, this brotherhood of yours is a single brotherhood, and I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore serve Me (and no other). Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so"worship Me. Surely this Islam is your religion, one religion (only), and I am your Lord, therefore serve Me. But (later generations) cut off their affair (of unity), one from another: (yet) will they all return to Us. And they have broken their religion (into fragments) among them, (yet) all are returning unto Us. And they broke their religion (into sects) between them: to Us shall all come back. Whoever works any act of righteousness and has faith,- his endeavour will not be rejected: We shall record it in his favour. Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no rejection of his effort. Lo! We record (it) for him. Therefore whoever shall do of good deeds and he is a believer, there shall be no denying of his exertion, and surely We will write (It) down for him. But there is a ban on any population which We have destroyed: that they shall not return, And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they shall not return. And it is binding on a town which We destroy that they shall not return. Until the Gog and Magog (people) are let through (their barrier), and they swiftly swarm from every hill. Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they hasten out of every mound, Even when Gog and Magog are let loose and they shall break forth from every elevated place. Then will the true promise draw nigh (of fulfilment): then behold! the eyes of the Unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror: "Ah! Woe to us! we were indeed heedless of this; nay, we truly did wrong!" And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers! And the true promise shall draw nigh, then lo! the eyes of those who disbelieved shall be fixedly open: O woe to us! surely we were in a state of heedlessness as to this; nay, we were unjust. Verily ye, (unbelievers), and the (false) gods that ye worship besides God, are (but) fuel for Hell! to it will ye (surely) come! Lo! ye (idolaters) and that which ye worship beside God are fuel of hell. Thereunto ye will come. Surely you and what you worship besides God are the firewood of hell; to it you shall come. If these had been gods, they would not have got there! but each one will abide therein. If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide therein. Had these been gods, they would not have come to it and all shall abide therein. There, sobbing will be their lot, nor will they there hear (aught else). Therein wailing is their portion, and therein they hear not. For them therein shall be groaning and therein they shall not hear. Those for whom the good (record) from Us has gone before, will be removed far therefrom. Lo! those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us, they will be far removed from thence. Surely (as for) those for whom the good has already gone forth from Us, they shall be kept far off from it; Not the slightest sound will they hear of Hell: what their souls desired, in that will they dwell. They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which their souls desire. They will not hear its faintest sound, and they shall abide in that which their souls long for. The Great Terror will bring them no grief: but the angels will meet them (with mutual greetings): "This is your Day,- (the Day) that ye were promised." The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels will welcome them, (saying): This is your Day which ye were promised; The great fearful event shall not grieve them, and the angels shall meet them: This is your day which you were promised. The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books (completed),- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it. The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise (binding) upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it. On the day when We will roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We originated the first creation, (so) We shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about. Before this We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message (given to Moses): "My servants the righteous, shall inherit the earth." And verily we have written in the Scripture, after the Reminder: My righteous slaves will inherit the earth: And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that (as for) the land, My righteous servants shall inherit it. Verily in this (Qur'an) is a Message for people who would (truly) worship God. Lo! there is a plain statement for folk who are devout. Most surely in this is a message to a people who serve. We sent thee not, but as a Mercy for all creatures. We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples. And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds. Say: "What has come to me by inspiration is that your God is One God: will ye therefore bow to His Will (in Islam)?" Say: It is only inspired in me that your God is One God. Will ye then surrender (unto Him)? Say: It is only revealed to me that your God is one God; will you then submit? But if they turn back, say: "I have proclaimed the Message to you all alike and in truth; but I know not whether that which ye are promised is near or far." But if they are averse, then say: I have warned you all alike, although I know not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised. But if they turn back, say: I have given you warning in fairness and I do not know whether what you are threatened with is near or far: "It is He Who knows what is open in speech and what ye hide (in your hearts)." Lo! He knoweth that which is said openly, and that which ye conceal. Surely He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you hide: "I know not but that it may be a trial for you, and a grant of (worldly) livelihood (to you) for a time." And I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and enjoyment for a while. And I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision till a time. Say: "O my Lord! judge Thou in truth!" "Our Lord Most Gracious is the One Whose assistance should be sought against the blasphemies ye utter!" He saith: My Lord! Judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Beneficent, Whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe (unto Him). He said: O my Lord! judge Thou with truth; and our Lord is the Beneficent God, Whose help is sought against what you ascribe (to Him).the trumpet will be blown, so We will gather them all together; 018.100 Y: And We shall present Hell that day for Unbelievers to see, all spread out,- P: On that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers, plain to view, S: And We will bring forth hell, exposed to view, on that day before the unbelievers. 018.101 Y: (Unbelievers) whose eyes had been under a veil from remembrance of Me, and who had been unable even to hear. P: Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder, and who could not bear to hear. S: They whose eyes were under a cover from My reminder and they could not even hear. 018.102 Y: Do the Unbelievers think that they can take My servants as protectors besides Me? Verily We have prepared Hell for the Unbelievers for (their) entertainment. P: Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting friends beside Me? Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers. S: What! do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants to be guardians besides Me? Surely We have prepared hell for the entertainment of the unbelievers. 018.103 Y: Say: "Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deeds?"- P: Say: Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works? S: Say: Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in (their) deeds? 018.104 Y: "Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that they were acquiring good by their works?" P: Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world, and yet they reckon that they do good work. S: (These are) they whose labor is lost in this world's life and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of hands. 018.105 Y: They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord and the fact of their having to meet Him (in the Hereafter): vain will be their works, nor shall We, on the Day of Judgment, give them any weight. P: Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the meeting with Him. Therefore their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We assign no weight to them. S: These are they who disbelieve in the communications of their Lord and His meeting, so their deeds become null, and therefore We will not set up a balance for them on the day of resurrection. 018.106 Y: That is their reward, Hell, because they rejected Faith, and took My Signs and My Messengers by way of jest. P: That is their reward: hell, because they disbelieved, and made a jest of Our revelations and Our messengers. S: Thus it is that their recompense is hell, because they disbelieved and held My communications and My messengers in mockery. 018.107 Y: As to those who believe and work righteous deeds, they have, for their entertainment, the Gardens of Paradise, P: Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs are the Gardens of Paradise for welcome, S: Surely (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, their place of entertainment shall be the gardens of paradise, 018.108 Y: Wherein they shall dwell (for aye): no change will they wish for from them. P: Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence. S: Abiding therein; they shall not desire removal from them. 018.109 Y: Say: "If the ocean were ink (wherewith to write out) the words of my Lord, sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the words of my Lord, even if we added another ocean like it, for its aid." P: Say: Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, verily the sea would be used up before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even though We brought the like thereof to help. S: Say: If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would surely be consumed before the words of my Lord are exhausted, though We were to bring the like of that (sea) to add thereto. 018.110 Y: Say: "I am but a man like yourselves, (but) the inspiration has come to me, that your God is one God: whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner." P: Say: I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your God is only One God. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord. S: Say: I am only a mortal like you; it is revealed to me that your god is one God, therefore whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds, and not join any one in the service of his Lord. - Chapter 19: MARYAM (MARY) Total Verses: 98 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 019.001 Y: Kaf.

P: Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord. S: He said: My Lord! surely my bones are weakened and my head flares with hoariness, and, my Lord! I have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to Thee: 019.005 Y: "Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,"- P: Lo!

Oh, give me from Thy presence a successor, S: And surely I fear my cousins after me, and my wife is barren, therefore grant me from Thyself an heir, 019.006 Y: "(One that) will (truly) represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!" P: Who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee). S: Who should inherit me and inherit from the children of Yaqoub, and make him, my Lord, one in whom Thou art well pleased. 019.007 Y: (His prayer was answered): "O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before." P: (It was said unto him): O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him). S: O Zakariya! surely We give you good news of a boy whose name shall be Yahya: We have not made before anyone his equal. 019.008 Y: He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?" P: He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm old age? S: He said: O my Lord! when shall I have a son, and my wife is barren, and I myself have reached indeed the extreme degree of old age? 019.009 Y: He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'" P: He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I created thee before, when thou wast naught. S: He said: So shall it be, your Lord says: It is easy to Me, and indeed I created you before, when you were nothing. 019.010 Y: (Zakariya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb." P: He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights. S: He said: My Lord! give me a sign. He said: Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people three nights while in sound health. 019.011 Y: So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate God's praises in the morning and in the evening. P: Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night.

P: And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East, S: And mention Marium in the Book when she drew aside from her family to an eastern place; 019.017 Y: She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects. P: And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man. S: So she took a veil (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our spirit, and there appeared to her a well-made man. 019.018 Y: She said: "I seek refuge from thee to (God) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear God." P: She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing. S: She said: Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent God, if you are one guarding (against evil). 019.019 Y: He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son."

S: He said: I am only a messenger of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy. 019.020 Y: She said: "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?" P: She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste? S: She said: When shall I have a boy and no mortal has yet touched me, nor have I been unchaste? 019.021 Y: He said: ""after having knowledge he does not know anything; and you see the earth sterile land, but when We send down on it the water, it stirs and swells and brings forth of every kind a beautiful herbage. This is so, because God is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who has power over all things. And verily the Hour will come: there can be no doubt about it, or about the fact that God will raise up all who are in the graves. Yet there is among men such a one as disputes about God, without knowledge, without guidance, and without a Book of Enlightenment. (Disdainfully) bending his side, in order to lead men astray from the Path of God: for him there is disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Judgment We shall make him taste the Penalty of burning (Fire). This is because of the deeds which thy hands sent forth, for verily God is not unjust to His servants. There are among men some who serve God, as it were, on the verge: if good befalls them, they are, therewith, well content; but if a trial comes to them, they turn on their faces: they lose both this world and the Hereafter: that is loss for all to see! They call on such deities, besides God, as can neither hurt nor profit them: that is straying far indeed from the Way! (Perhaps) they call on one whose hurt is nearer than his profit: evil, indeed, is the patron, and evil the companion! Verily God will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens, beneath which rivers flow: for God carries out all that He plans. If any think that God will not help him (His Messenger) in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the ceiling and cut himself off: then let him see whether his plan will remove that which enrages him! Thus have We sent down Clear Signs; and verily God doth guide whom He will! Those who believe (in the Qur'an), those who follow the Jewish scriptures, and the Sabians, Christians, Magians, and Polytheists,- God will judge between them on the Day of Judgment: for God is witness of all things. Seest thou not that to God bow down in worship all things that are in the heavens and on earth,- the sun, the moon, the stars; the hills, the trees, the animals; and a great number among mankind? But a great number are also such as are fit for Punishment: and such as God shall disgrace,- None can raise to honour: for God carries out all that He wills. These two antagonists dispute with each other about their Lord: But those who deny their Lord, for them will be cut out a garment of Fire: over their heads will be poured out boiling water. With it will be scalded what is within their bodies, as well as their skins. In addition there will be maces of iron to punish them. Every time they wish to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be forced back therein, and it will be said, 'Taste ye the Penalty of Burning!' God will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow: they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk. For they have been guided in this life to the purest of speeches; they have been guided to the Path of Him Who is Worthy of all Praise. As to those who have rejected God, and would keep back men from the Way of God, and from the Sacred Mosque, which We have made open to all men - equal is the dweller there and the visitor from the country - and any whose purpose therein is profanity or wrong-doing - them will We cause to taste of a most Grievous Penalty. Behold! We gave the site, to Abraham, of the Sacred House, saying: 'Associate not anything in worship with Me; and sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or stand up, or bow, or prostrate themselves therein in prayer.'""And We assigned to Ibrahim the place of the House, saying: Do not associate with Me aught, and purify My House for those who make the circuit and stand to pray and bow and prostrate themselves. And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men: they will come to thee on foot and mounted on every kind of camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways. That they may witness the benefits provided for them, and celebrate the name of God, through the Days appointed, over the cattle which He has provided for them for sacrifice: then eat thereof and feed the distressed ones in want. Then let them complete the rites prescribed for them, perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House. Such is the Pilgrimage: whoever honors the sacred rites of God, for him it is good in the Sight of his Lord. Lawful to you for food in Pilgrimage are cattle, except those mentioned to you as exceptions: but shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word that is false. Being true in faith to God, and never assigning partners to Him: if anyone assigns partners to God, it is as if he had fallen from heaven and been snatched up by birds, or the wind had swooped and thrown him into a far-distant place. Such is his state: and whoever holds in honor the symbols of God, in the sacrifice of animals, such honor should come truly from piety of heart. In them ye have benefits for a term appointed: in the end their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House. To every people did We appoint rites of sacrifice, that they might celebrate the name of God over the sustenance He gave them from animals fit for food. But your God is One God: submit then your wills to Him in Islam: and give thou the good news to those who humble themselves. To those whose hearts when God is mentioned, are filled with fear, who show patient perseverance over their afflictions, keep up regular prayer, and spend in charity out of what We have bestowed upon them. The sacrificial camels we have made for you as among the symbols from God: in them is much good for you: then pronounce the name of God over them as they line up for sacrifice: when they are down on their sides after slaughter, eat thereof, and feed such as live in contentment, and such as beg with due humility: thus have We made animals subject to you, that ye may be grateful. It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches God: it is your piety that reaches Him: He has thus made them subject to you, that ye may glorify God for His Guidance to you and proclaim the good news to all who do right. Verily God will defend from ill those who believe: verily, God loves not any that is a traitor to faith, or shows ingratitude. To those against whom war is made, permission is given to fight, because they are wronged; and verily, God is most powerful for their aid. They are those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right, for no cause except that they say, 'Our Lord is God.' Did not God check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of God is commemorated in abundant measure. God will certainly aid those who aid His cause; for verily God is full of Strength, Exalted in Might, able to enforce His Will. They are those who, if We establish them in the land, establish regular prayer and give regular charity, enjoin the right and forbid wrong: with God rests the end and decision of all affairs. If they treat thy mission as false, so did the peoples before them with their prophets, the People of Noah, and 'Ad and Thamud. Those of Abraham and Lut. And the Companions of the Madyan People; and Moses was rejected in the same way. But I granted respite to the Unbelievers, and only after that did I punish them: but how terrible was My rejection of them! How many populations have We destroyed, which were given to wrong-doing? They tumbled down on their roof."And how many wells are lying idle and neglected, and castles lofty and well-built? How many a township have We destroyed while it was sinful, so that it lies in ruins, and a deserted well and lofty tower! Do they not travel through the land, so that their hearts may learn wisdom and their ears may learn to hear? Truly it is not their eyes that are blind, but their hearts which are in their breasts. Yet they ask thee to hasten on the Punishment! But God will not fail in His Promise. Verily a Day in the sight of thy Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning. And to how many populations did I give respite, which were given to wrong-doing? In the end, I punished them. To Me is the destination of all. Say: "O men! I am sent to you only to give a Clear Warning." Those who believe and work righteousness, for them is forgiveness and a sustenance most generous. But those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them, they will be Companions of the Fire. Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before thee, but when he framed a desire, Satan threw some vanity into his desire: but God will cancel anything vain that Satan throws in, and God will confirm His Signs: for God is full of Knowledge and Wisdom. That He may make the suggestions thrown in by Satan a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and who are hardened of heart: verily the wrong-doers are in a schism far from the Truth. And that those on whom knowledge has been bestowed may learn that the Qur'an is the Truth from thy Lord, and that they may believe therein, and their hearts may be made humbly open to it: for verily God is the Guide of those who believe, to the Straight Way. Those who reject Faith will not cease to be in doubt concerning Revelation until the Hour of Judgment comes suddenly upon them, or there comes to them the Penalty of a Day of Disaster. On that Day, Dominion will be that of God: He will judge between them: so those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight. And for those who reject Faith and deny our Signs, there will be a humiliating Punishment. Those who leave their homes in the cause of God, and are then slain or die, on them will God bestow verily a goodly Provision: Truly God is He Who bestows the best provision. Verily He will admit them to a place with which they shall be well pleased: for God is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. And if one has retaliated to no greater extent than the injury he received, and is again set upon inordinately, God will help him: for God is One that blots out sins and forgives again and again. That is because God merges night into day, and He merges day into night, and verily it is God Who hears and sees all things. That is because God is the Reality; and those besides Him whom they invoke, they are but vain Falsehood: verily God is He, Most High, Most Great. Seest thou not that God sends down rain from the sky, and forthwith the earth becomes clothed with green? For God is He Who understands the finest mysteries, and is well-acquainted with them. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: for verily God, He is free of all wants, Worthy of all Praise. Seest thou not that God has made subject to you all that is on the earth, and the ships that sail through the sea by His Command? He withholds the sky from falling on the earth except by His leave: for God is Most Kind and Most Merciful to man. It is He Who gave you life, will cause you to die, and will again give you life: Truly man is a most ungrateful creature! To every People have We appointed rites and ceremonies which they must follow: let them not then dispute with thee on the matter, but do thou invite them to thy Lord: for thou art assuredly on the Right Way."So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us': It is a matter (so) decreed." P: He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained. S: He said: Even so; your Lord says: It is easy to Me: and that We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter which has been decreed. 019.022 Y: So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. P: And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. S: So she conceived him; then withdrew herself with him to a remote place. 019.023 Y: And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!" P: And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! S: And the throes (of childbirth) compelled her to betake herself to the trunk of a palm tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died before this, and had been a thing quite forgotten! 019.024 Y: But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee;" P: Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee, S: Then (the child) called out to her from beneath her: Grieve not, surely your Lord has made a stream to flow beneath you; 019.025 Y: "And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee." P: And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee. S: And shake towards you the trunk of the palm-tree, it will drop on you fresh ripe dates: 019.026 Y: "So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye. And if thou dost see any man, say, 'I have vowed a fast to (God) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being.'" P: So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal. S: So eat and drink and refresh the eye. Then if you see any mortal, say: Surely I have vowed a fast to the Beneficent God, so I shall not speak to any man today. 019.027 Y: At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: "O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought!" P: Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Thou hast come with an amazing thing. S: And she came to her people with him, carrying him (with her). They said: O Mary! surely you have done a strange thing. 019.028 Y: "O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste!" P: O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. S: O sister of Aaron! your father was not a bad man, nor was your mother an unchaste woman. 019.029 Y: But she pointed to the babe. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?" P: Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy? S: But she pointed to him. They said: How should we speak to one who was a child in the cradle? 019.030 Y: He said: "I am indeed a servant of God: He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet;" P: He spake: Lo! I am the slave of God. He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet, S: He said: Surely I am a servant of God; He has given me the Book and made me a prophet; 019.031 Y: "And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be, and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live;" P: And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, S: And He has made me blessed wherever I may be, and He has enjoined on me prayer and poor-rate so long as I live; 019.032 Y: "(He) hath made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable;" P: And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. S: And dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me insolent, unblessed; 019.033 Y: "So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)!" P: Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! S: And peace on me on the day I was born, and on the day I die, and on the day I am raised to life. 019.034 Y: Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute. P: Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. S: Such is Isa, son of Mary; (this is) the saying of truth about which they dispute. 019.035 Y: It is not befitting to (the majesty of) God that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, "Be," and it is. P: It befitteth not (the Majesty of) God that He should take unto Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. S: It beseems not God that He should take to Himself a son, glory be to Him; when He has decreed a matter He only says to it "Be," and it is. 019.036 Y: Verily God is my Lord and your Lord: Him therefore serve ye: this is a Way that is straight. P: And lo! God is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right path. S: And surely God is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path. 019.037 Y: But the sects differ among themselves: and woe to the unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of a Momentous Day! P: The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of an awful Day. S: But parties from among them disagreed with each other, so woe to those who disbelieve, because of presence on a great day. 019.038 Y: How plainly will they see and hear, the Day that they will appear before Us! but the unjust today are in error manifest! P: See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are to-day in error manifest. S: How clearly shall they hear and how clearly shall they see on the day when they come to Us; but the unjust this day are in manifest error. 019.039 Y: But warn them of the Day of Distress, when the matter will be determined: for (behold,) they are negligent and they do not believe! P: And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not. S: And warn them of the day of intense regret, when the matter shall have been decided; and they are (now) in negligence and they do not believe. 019.040 Y: It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned. P: Lo! We, only We, inherit the earth and all who are thereon, and unto Us they are returned. S: Surely We inherit the earth and all those who are on it, and to Us they shall be returned. 019.041 Y: (Also) mention in the Book (the story of) Abraham: He was a man of Truth, a prophet. P: And make mention (O Muhammad) in the Scripture of Abraham. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet. S: And mention Ibrahim in the Book; surely he was a truthful man, a prophet. 019.042 Y: Behold, he said to his father: "O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing?" P: When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee? S: When he said to his father; O my father! why do you worship what neither hears nor sees, nor does it avail you in the least: 019.043 Y: "O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight." P: O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came not unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path. S: O my father! truly the knowledge has come to me which has not come to you, therefore follow me, I will guide you on a right path: 019.044 Y: "O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (God) Most Gracious." P: O my father! Serve not the devil. Lo! the devil is a rebel unto the Beneficent. S: O my father! serve not the Shaitan, surely the Shaitan is disobedient to the Beneficent God: 019.045 Y: "O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (God) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend." P: O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee so that thou become a comrade of the devil. S: O my father! surely I fear that a punishment from the Beneficent God should afflict you so that you should be a friend of the Shaitan. 019.046 Y: (The father) replied: "Dost thou hate my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while!" P: He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham? If thou cease not, I shall surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while! S: He said: Do you dislike my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not desist I will certainly revile you, and leave me for a time. 019.047 Y: Abraham said: "Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious." P: He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. Lo! He was ever gracious unto me. S: He said: Peace be on you, I will pray to my Lord to forgive you; surely He is ever Affectionate to me: 019.048 Y: "And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides God: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest." P: I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside God, and I shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be unblest. S: And I will withdraw from you and what you call on besides God, and I will call upon my Lord; may be I shall not remain unblessed in calling upon my Lord. 019.049 Y: When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides God, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet. P: So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping beside God, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a prophet. S: So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped besides God, We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub, and each one of them We made a prophet. 019.050 Y: And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them, and We granted them lofty honour on the tongue of truth. P: And we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true renown. S: And We granted to them of Our mercy, and We left (behind them) a truthful mention of eminence for them. 019.051 Y: Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet. P: And makeTo every nation We appointed acts of devotion which they observe, therefore they should not dispute with you about the matter and call to your Lord; most surely you are on a right way. If they do wrangle with thee, say, "God knows best what it is ye are doing." God will judge between you on the Day of Judgment concerning the matters in which ye differ. Knowest thou not that God knows all that is in heaven and on earth? Indeed it is all in a Record, and that is easy for God. Yet they worship, besides God, things for which no authority has been sent down to them, and of which they have no knowledge: for those that do wrong there is no helper. When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, thou wilt notice a denial on the faces of the Unbelievers! They nearly attack with violence those who rehearse Our Signs to them. Say, "Shall I tell you of something worse than these Signs? It is the Fire (of Hell)! God has promised it to the Unbelievers! And evil is that destination!" O men! Here is a parable set forth! Listen to it! Those on whom, besides God, ye call, cannot create even a fly, if they all met together for the purpose! And if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition and those whom they petition! No just estimate have they made of God: for God is He Who is strong and able to carry out His Will. God chooses messengers from angels and from men for God is He Who hears and sees all things. He knows what is before them and what is behind them: and to God go back all questions for decision. O ye who believe! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, and adore your Lord; and do good; that ye may prosper. And strive in His cause as ye ought to strive, with sincerity and under discipline. He has chosen you, and has imposed no difficulties on you in religion; it is the cult of your father Abraham. It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before and in this Revelation; that the Messenger may be a witness for you, and ye be witnesses for mankind! So establish regular Prayer, give regular Charity, and hold fast to God! He is your Protector - the Best to protect and the Best to help! 

Chapter 23: AL-MUMENOON (THE BELIEVERS)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

The believers must eventually win through, those who humble themselves in their prayers, who avoid vain talk, who are active in deeds of charity, who abstain from sex except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or the captives whom their right hands possess, for in their case they are free from blame. But those whose desires exceed those limits are transgressors. Those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants, and who strictly guard their prayers, these will be the heirs who will inherit Paradise: they will dwell therein forever. Man We did create from a quintessence of clay; then We placed him as a drop of sperm in a place of rest, firmly fixed; then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood; then of that clot We made a foetus lump; then We made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then We developed out of it another creature. So blessed be God, the best to create! After that, at length ye will die. Again, on the Day of Judgment, will ye be raised up. And We have made, above you, seven tracts; and We are never unmindful of Our Creation. And We send down water from the sky according to due measure, and We cause it to soak in the soil; and We certainly are able to drain it off with ease. With it We grow for you gardens of date-palms and vines: in them have ye abundant fruits: and of them ye eat and have enjoyment. Also a tree springing out of Mount Sinai, which produces oil, and relish for those who use it.for food. And a tree that grows out of Mount Sinai which produces oil and a condiment for those who eat. And in cattle, you have an instructive example: from within their bodies, We produce milk for you to drink; there are numerous other benefits for you, and of their meat, you eat. And on them and on the ships, you are carried. We sent Noah to his people: He said, "O my people! Worship God! You have no other god but Him. Will you not fear Him?" The chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said, "He is no more than a man like yourselves: his wish is to assert his superiority over you: if God had wished to send messengers, He could have sent down angels; never did we hear such a thing among our ancestors of old." Some said, "He is only a man possessed: wait with him for a time." Noah said, "O my Lord! Help me, for they accuse me of falsehood!" So We inspired him with this message: "Construct the Ark within Our sight and under Our guidance: then when Our Command comes, and the fountains of the earth gush forth, take on board pairs of every species, male and female, and your family—except those against whom the Word has already gone forth. And do not address Me in favor of the wrong-doers; for they shall be drowned." And when you have embarked on the Ark, you and those with you, say: "Praise be to God, Who has saved us from the people who do wrong." And say: "O my Lord! Enable me to disembark with Your blessing: for You are the Best to enable us to disembark." Verily in this, there are Signs for men to understand; thus do We try men. Then We raised after them another generation. And We sent to them a messenger from among themselves, saying, "Worship God! You have no other god but Him. Will you not fear Him?" The chiefs of his people, who disbelieved and denied the Meeting in the Hereafter, and on whom We had bestowed the good things of this life, said, "He is no more than a man like yourselves: he eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink. If you obey a man like yourselves, you will surely be lost. Does he promise that when you die and become dust and bones, you shall be brought forth again? Far, very far is that which you are promised! There is nothing but our life in this world! We die and we live! But we shall never be raised up again!" He is only a man who invents a lie against God, but we are not the ones to believe in him! The prophet said, "O my Lord! Help me, for they accuse me of falsehood." God said, "In but a little while, they are sure to be sorry!" Then the Blast overtook them with justice, and We made them as rubbish of dead leaves floating on the stream of Time! So away with the people who do wrong! Then We raised after them other generations. No people can hasten their term, nor can they delay it. Then We sent Our messengers in succession: every time there came to a people their messenger, they accused him of falsehood: so We made them follow each other in punishment: We made them as a tale that is told: So away with a people that will not believe! Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our Signs and authority manifest, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: But these behaved insolently: they were an arrogant people. They said, "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves? And their people are subject to us!" So they accused them of falsehood, and they became of those who were destroyed. And We gave Moses the Book, in order that they might receive guidance. And We made the son of Mary and his mother as a Sign: We gave them both shelter on high ground, affording rest and security and furnished with springs.We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and We gave them shelter on a lofty ground with meadows and springs. O messengers! Enjoy good and pure things, and work righteousness: for I am well-acquainted with all that you do. This Brotherhood of yours is a single Brotherhood, and I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore fear Me. But people have divided their unity into sects: each party rejoices in what it has. Leave them in their confused ignorance for a time. Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and sons, We would hasten them on in every good? Nay, they do not understand. Verily those who live in awe for fear of their Lord; those who believe in the Signs of their Lord; those who join not partners with their Lord; and those who dispense their charity with their hearts full of fear, because they will return to their Lord; it is these who hasten in every good work, and these who are foremost in them. On no soul do We place a burden greater than it can bear: before Us is a record which clearly shows the truth: they will never be wronged. But their hearts are in confused ignorance of this; and there are, besides that, deeds of theirs, which they will continue to do. Until, when We seize in Punishment those of them who received the good things of this world, behold, they will groan in supplication! It will be said: "Groan not in supplication this day: for you shall certainly not be helped by Us." My Signs used to be rehearsed to you, but you used to turn back on your heels in arrogance: talking nonsense about the Qur'an, like one telling fables by night. Do they not ponder over the Word of God, or has anything new come to them that did not come to their fathers of old? Or do they not recognize their Messenger, that they deny him? Or do they say, "He is possessed"? Nay, he has brought them the Truth, but most of them hate the Truth. If the Truth had been in accord with their desires, truly the heavens and the earth, and all beings therein would have been in confusion and corruption! Nay, We have sent them their admonition, but they turn away from their admonition. Or is it that you ask them for some recompense? But the recompense of your Lord is best: He is the Best of those who give sustenance. But verily you call them to the Straight Way; and verily those who believe not in the Hereafter are deviating from that Way. If We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering in distraction to and fro. We inflicted Punishment on them, but they humbled not themselves to their Lord, nor do they submissively entreat Him! Until We open on them a gate leading to a severe Punishment: then Lo! they will be plunged in despair therein! It is He Who has created for you the faculties of hearing, sight, feeling, and understanding: little thanks it is you give! And He has multiplied you through the earth, and to Him shall you be gathered back. It is He Who gives life and death, and to Him is due the alternation of Night and Day: will you not then understand? On the contrary, they say things similar to what the ancients said. They say: "What! when we die and become dust and bones, could we really be raised up again?" Such things have been promised to us and to our fathers before! They are nothing but tales of the ancients! Say: "To whom belong the earth and all beings therein? Say if you know!" They will say, "To God!" Say: "Yet will you not receive admonition?" Say: "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the Throne Supreme?"e mention in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was a messenger (of God), a prophet. S: And mention Musa in the Book; surely he was one purified, and he was a messenger, a prophet. 019.052 Y: And we called him from the right side of Mount (Sinai), and made him draw near to Us, for mystic (converse). P: We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in communion. S: And We called to him from the blessed side of the mountain, and We made him draw nigh, holding communion (with Us). 019.053 Y: And, out of Our Mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, (also) a prophet. P: And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet (likewise). S: And We gave to him out of Our mercy his brother Haroun a prophet. 019.054 Y: Also mention in the Book (the story of) Isma'il: He was (strictly) true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet. P: And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his promise, and he was a messenger (of God), a prophet. S: And mention Ismail in the Book; surely he was truthful in (his) promise, and he was a messenger, a prophet. 019.055 Y: He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord. P: He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in the sight of his Lord. S: And he enjoined on his family prayer and almsgiving, and was one in whom his Lord was well pleased. 019.056 Y: Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet: P: And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet; S: And mention Idris in the Book; surely he was a truthful man, a prophet, 019.057 Y: And We raised him to a lofty station. P: And We raised him to high station. S: And We raised him high in Heaven. 019.058 Y: Those were some of the prophets on whom God did bestow His Grace,- of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the Signs of (God) Most Gracious were rehearsed to them, they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears. P: These are they unto whom God showed favour from among the prophets, of the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down, adoring and weeping. S: These are they on whom God bestowed favors, from among the prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those whom We carried with Nuh, and of the seed of Ibrahim and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose; when the communications of the Beneficent God were recited to them, they fell down making obeisance and weeping. 019.059 Y: But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face Destruction,- P: Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception. S: But there came after them an evil generation, who neglected prayers and followed and sensual desires, so they win meet perdition, 019.060 Y: Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least,- P: Save him who shall repent and believe and do right. Such will enter the Garden, and they will not be wronged in aught - S: Except such as repent and believe and do good, these shall enter the garden, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly in any way: 019.061 Y: Gardens of Eternity, those which (God) Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen: for His promise must (necessarily) come to pass. P: Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the unseen. Lo! His promise is ever sure of fulfilment - S: The gardens of perpetuity which the Beneficent God has promised to His servants while unseen; surely His promise shall come to pass. 019.062Y: They will not there hear any vain discourse, but only salutations of Peace: And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and evening. P: They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food for morn and evening. S: They shall not hear therein any vain discourse, but only: Peace, and they shall have their sustenance therein morning and evening. 019.063 Y: Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil. P: Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to inherit. S: This is the garden which We cause those of Our servants to inherit who guard (against evil). 019.064 Y: (The angels say:) "We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,"- P: We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those two, and thy Lord was never forgetful - S: And we do not descend but by the command of your Lord; to Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between these, and your Lord is not forgetful. 019.065 Y: "Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?" P: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefore, worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can be named along with Him? S: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, so serve Him and be patient in His service. Do you know any one equal to Him? 019.066 Y: Man says: "What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?" P: And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive? S: And says man: What! when I am dead shall I truly be brought forth alive? 019.067 Y: But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing? P: Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught? S: Does not man remember that We created him before, when he was nothing? 019.068 Y: So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Evil Ones (with them); then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell; P: And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We shall bring them, crouching, around hell. S: So by your Lord! We will most certainly gather them together and the Shaitans, then shall We certainly cause them to be present round hell on their knees. 019.069 Y: Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against (God) Most Gracious. P: Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent. S: Then We will most certainly draw forth from every sect of them him who is most exorbitantly rebellious against the Beneficent God. 019.070 Y: And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein. P: And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein. S: Again We do certainly know best those who deserve most to be burned therein. 019.071Y: Not one of you but will pass over it: this is, with thy Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished. P: There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of thy Lord. S: And there is not one of you but shall come to it; this is an unavoidable decree of your Lord. 019.072 Y: But We shall save those who guarded against evil, and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein, (humbled) to their knees. P: Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers crouching there. S: And We will deliver those who guarded (against evil), and We will leave the unjust therein on their knees. 019.073 Y: When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say to those who believe, "Which of the two sides is best in point of position? Which makes the best show in council?" P: And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in position, and more imposing as an army? S: And when Our clear communications are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Which of the two parties is best in abiding and best in assembly? 019.074 Y: But how many (countless) generations before them have we destroyed, who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye? P: How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming! S: And how many of the generations have We destroyed before them who were better in respect of goods and outward appearance! 019.075 Y: Say: "If any men go astray, (God) Most Gracious extends (the rope) to them, until, when they see the warning of God (being fulfilled) - either in punishment or in (the approach of) the Hour,- they will at length realise who is worst in position, and (who) weakest in forces!" P: Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be punishment (in the world), or the Hour (of doom), they will know who is worse in position and who is weaker as an army. S: Say: As for him who remains in error, the Beneficent God will surely prolong his length of days, until they see what they were threatened with, either the punishment or the hour; then they shall know who is in more evil plight and weaker in forces. 019.076 Y: "And God doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return." P: God increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better for resort. S: And God increases in guidance those who go aright; and ever-abiding good works are with your Lord best in recompense and best in yielding fruit. 019.077 Y: Hast thou then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: "I shall certainly be given wealth and children?" P: Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children? S: Have you, then, seen him who disbelieves in Our communications and says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children? 019.078Y: Has he penetrated to the Unseen, or has he taken a contract with (God) Most Gracious? P: Hath he perused the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent? S: Has he gained knowledge of the unseen, or made a covenant with the Beneficent God? 019.079 Y: Nay! We shall record what he says, and We"Who is the Lord of the mighty dominion?" They will say, "They belong to God." Say, "Will you not then be filled with awe?" They will say, "Unto God all that belongs." Say, "Will you not then keep duty unto Him?" They will say, "This is God's." Say, "Will you not then guard against evil?" Say, "Who is it in whose hands is the governance of all things, who protects all, but is not protected by any? Say if you know." They will say, "It belongs to God." Say, "Then how are you deluded?" They will say, "Unto God all that belongs." Say, "How then are you bewitched?" They will say, "This is God's." Say, "From whence are you then deceived?" We have sent them the Truth, but they indeed practice falsehood! Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars. No son did God beget, nor is there any god along with Him: if there were many gods, behold, each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have lorded it over others! Glory to God! He is free from the things they attribute to Him! God has not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be God above all that they allege. Never did God take to Himself a son, and never was there with Him any other god; in that case, each god would have certainly taken away what he created, and some of them would certainly have overpowered others; glory be to God above what they describe! He knows what is hidden and what is open: too high is He for the partners they attribute to Him! Knower of the invisible and the visible! and exalted be He over all that they ascribe as partners unto Him! Say: "O my Lord! if Thou wilt show me in my lifetime that which they are warned against,"- Say: "My Lord! If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised." Say: "O my Lord! if Thou shouldst make me see what they are threatened with:" "Then, O my Lord! put me not amongst the people who do wrong!" My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk. My Lord! then place me not with the unjust. And We are certainly able to show thee in fulfillment that against which they are warned. And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them. And most surely We are well able to make you see what We threaten them with. Repel evil with that which is best: We are well acquainted with the things they say. Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best Aware of that which they allege. Repel evil by what is best; We know best what they describe. And say "O my Lord! I seek refuge with Thee from the suggestions of the Evil Ones." And say: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones, And say: O my Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the evil suggestions of the Shaitans; "And I seek refuge with Thee O my Lord! lest they should come near me." And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me, And I seek refuge in Thee! O my Lord! from their presence. Until, when death comes to one of them, he says: "O my Lord! send me back to life,"- Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith: My Lord! Send me back, Until when death overtakes one of them, he says: Send me back, my Lord, send me back; "In order that I may work righteousness in the things I neglected." - "By no means! It is but a word he says."- Before them is a Partition till the Day they are raised up. That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a word that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised. Haply I may do good in that which I have left. By no means! it is a mere word that he speaks; and before them is a barrier until the day they are raised. Then when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no more relationships between them that day, nor will one ask after another! And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day, nor will they ask of one another. So when the trumpet is blown, there shall be no ties of relationship between them on that day, nor shall they ask of each other. Then those whose balance of good deeds is heavy, they will attain salvation: Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful. Then as for him whose good deeds are preponderant, these are the successful. But those whose balance is light, will be those who have lost their souls, in Hell will they abide. And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell abiding. And as for him whose good deeds are light, these are they who shall have lost their souls, abiding in hell. The Fire will burn their faces, and they will therein grin, with their lips displaced. The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein. The fire shall scorch their faces, and they therein shall be in severe affliction. "Were not My Signs rehearsed to you, and ye did but treat them as falsehood?" It will be said: Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye used to deny them? Were not My communications recited to you? But you used to reject them. They will say: "Our Lord! Our misfortune overwhelmed us, and we became a people astray!" They will say: Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring folk. They shall say: O our Lord! our adversity overcame us and we were an erring people: "Our Lord! bring us out of this: if ever we return to Evil, then shall we be wrong-doers indeed!" Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return to evil then indeed we shall be wrong-doers. O our Lord! Take us out of it; then if we return to evil surely we shall be unjust. He will say: "Be ye driven into it with ignominy! And speak ye not to Me!" He saith: Begone therein, and speak not unto Me. He shall say: Go away into it and speak not to Me; "A part of My servants there was, who used to pray 'our Lord! we believe; then do Thou forgive us, and have mercy upon us: For Thou art the Best of those who show mercy!" Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said: Our Lord! We believe, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy; Surely there was a party of My servants who said: O our Lord! we believe, so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones. "But ye treated them with ridicule, so much so that ridicule of them made you forget My Message while ye were laughing at them!" But ye chose them for a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them. But you took them for a mockery until they made you forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them. "I have rewarded them this Day for their patience and constancy: they are indeed the ones that have achieved Bliss" Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast; and they surely are the triumphant. Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were patient, that they are the achievers. He will say: "What number of years did ye stay on earth?" He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years? He will say: How many years did you tarry in the earth? They will say: "We stayed a day or part of a day: but ask those who keep account." They will say: We tarried by a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep count! They will say: We tarried a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep account. He will say: "Ye stayed not but a little, if ye had only known!" He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew. He will say: You did tarry but a little had you but known it: "Did ye then think that We had created you in jest, and that ye would not be brought back to Us for account?" Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not be returned unto Us? What! did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you shall not be returned to Us? Therefore exalted be God, the King, the Reality: there is no god but He, the Lord of the Throne of Honour! Now God be Exalted, the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord of the Throne of Grace. So exalted be God, the True King; no god is there but He, the Lord of the honorable dominion. If anyone invokes, besides God, any other god, he has no authority therefor; and his reckoning will be only with his Lord! and verily the Unbelievers will fail to win through! He who cries unto any other god along with God has no proof thereof. His reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful. And whoever invokes with God another god he has no proof of this his reckoning is only with his Lord; surely the unbelievers shall not be successful. So say: "O my Lord! grant Thou forgiveness and mercy for Thou art the Best of those who show mercy!" And say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art best of all who show mercy. And say: O my Lord! forgive and have mercy, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones."Believe in God and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their punishment. (As for) the fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes, and let not pity for them detain you in the matter of obedience to God, if you believe in God and the Last Day, and let a party of believers witness their chastisement.

Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the believers such a thing is forbidden. The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress, and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater. All that is forbidden unto believers.

And those who launch a charge against chaste women, and produce not four witnesses (to support their allegations), flog them with eighty stripes; and reject their evidence ever after: for such men are wicked transgressors. Unless they repent thereafter and mend their conduct; for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have no evidence but their own, their solitary evidence can be received if they bear witness four times with an oath by God that they are solemnly telling the truth. And the fifth oath should be that they solemnly invoke the curse of God on themselves if they tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife if she bears witness four times with an oath by God that her husband is telling a lie. And the fifth oath should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of God on herself if her accuser is telling the truth.

If it were not for God's grace and mercy on you, and that God is Oft-Returning, Full of Wisdom, you would be ruined indeed. Those who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves: think it not to be an evil to you; on the contrary, it is good for you. To every man among them will come the punishment of the sin that he earned, and to him who took on himself the lead among them, will be a penalty grievous.

Why did not the believers, men and women, when you heard of the affair, put the best construction on it in their own minds and say, "This charge is an obvious lie"? Why did they not bring four witnesses to prove it? When they have not brought the witnesses, such men, in the sight of God, stand forth themselves as liars. Were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, in this world and the Hereafter, a grievous penalty would have seized you in that you rushed glibly into this affair.

Behold, you received it on your tongues, and said out of your mouths things of which you had no knowledge; and you thought it to be a light matter, while it was most serious in the sight of God. And why did you not, when you heard it, say, "It is not right of us to speak of this: Glory to God! This is a most serious slander"? God admonishes you that you may never repeat such conduct if you are true believers. And God makes the signs plain to you: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom.

Those who love to see scandal published among the believers will have a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: God knows, and you know not. Were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, and that God is full of kindness and mercy, you would be ruined indeed. O you who believe! Follow not Satan's footsteps: if any will follow the footsteps of Satan, he will but command what is shameful and wrong. And were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, not one of you would ever have been pure: but God purifies whom He pleases: and God is One Who hears and knows all things.

Let not those among you who are endowed with grace and amplitude of means resolve by oath against helping their kinsmen, those in want, and those who have left their homes in God's cause: let them forgive and overlook, do you not wish that God should forgive you? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Those who slander chaste women, indiscreet but believing, are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous penalty. On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.""shall add and add to his punishment. P: Nay, but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of torment. S: By no means! We write down what he says, and We will lengthen to him the length of the chastisement, 019.080 Y: To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone. P: And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he will come unto Us, alone (without his wealth and children). S: And We will inherit of him what he says, and he shall come to Us alone. 019.081 Y: And they have taken (for worship) gods other than God, to give them power and glory! P: And they have chosen (other) gods beside God that they may be a power for them. S: And they have taken gods besides God, that they should be to them a source of strength; 019.082 Y: Instead, they shall reject their worship, and become adversaries against them. P: Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them. S: By no means! They shall soon deny their worshipping them, and they shall be adversaries to them. 019.083 Y: Seest thou not that We have set the Evil Ones on against the unbelievers, to incite them with fury? P: Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion? S: Do you not see that We have sent the Shaitans against the unbelievers, inciting them by incitement? 019.084 Y: So make no haste against them, for We but count out to them a (limited) number (of days). P: So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto them a sum (of days). S: Therefore be not in haste against them, We only number out to them a number (of days). 019.085 Y: The day We shall gather the righteous to (God) Most Gracious, like a band presented before a king for honours, P: On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly company. S: The day on which We will gather those who guard (against evil) to the Beneficent God to receive honors, 019.086 Y: And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water,- P: And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd, S: And We will drive the guilty to hell thirsty 019.087 Y: None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from (God) Most Gracious. P: They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a covenant with his Lord. S: They shall not control intercession, save he who has made a covenant with the Beneficent God. 019.088 Y: They say: "(God) Most Gracious has begotten a son!" P: And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. S: And they say: The Beneficent God has taken (to Himself) a son. 019.089 Y: Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous! P: Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing S: Certainly you have made an abominable assertion 019.090 Y: At it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin, P: Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins, S: The heavens may almost be rent thereat, and the earth cleave asunder, and the mountains fall down in pieces, 019.091 Y: That they should invoke a son for (God) Most Gracious. P: That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son, S: That they ascribe a son to the Beneficent God. 019.092 Y: For it is not consonant with the majesty of (God) Most Gracious that He should beget a son. P: When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should choose a son. S: And it is not worthy of the Beneficent God that He should take (to Himself) a son. 019.093 Y: Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (God) Most Gracious as a servant. P: There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave. S: There is no one in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Beneficent God as a servant. 019.094 Y: He does take an account of them (all), and hath numbered them (all) exactly. P: Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering. S: Certainly He has a comprehensive knowledge of them and He has numbered them a (comprehensive) numbering. 019.095 Y: And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment. P: And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone. S: And every one of them will come to Him on the day of resurrection alone. 019.096 Y: On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will (God) Most Gracious bestow love. P: Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for them love. S: Surely (as for) those who believe and do good deeds for them will God bring about love. 019.097 Y: So have We made the (Qur'an) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention. P: And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn therewith the froward folk. S: So We have only made it easy in your tongue that you may give good news thereby to those who guard (against evil) and warn thereby a vehemently contentious people. 019.098 Y: But how many (countless) generations before them have We destroyed? Canst thou find a single one of them (now) or hear (so much as) a whisper of them? P: And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound? S: And how many a generation have We destroyed before them! Do you see any one of them or hear a sound of them? - Chapter 20: TA-HA (TA-HA) Total Verses: 135 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 020.001 Y: Ta-Ha. P: Ta. Ha. S: Ta Ha. 020.002 Y: We have not sent down the Qur'an to thee to be (an occasion) for thy distress, P: We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur'an that thou shouldst be distressed, S: We have not revealed the Quran to you that you may be unsuccessful. 020.003 Y: But only as an admonition to those who fear (God),- P: But as a reminder unto him who feareth, S: Nay, it is a reminder to him who fears: 020.004 Y: A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the heavens on high. P: A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens, S: A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens. 020.005 Y: (God) Most Gracious is firmly established on the throne (of authority). P: The Beneficent One, Who is established on the Throne. S: The Beneficent God is firm in power. 020.006 Y: To Him belongs what is in the heavens and on earth, and all between them, and all beneath the soil. P: Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is beneath the sod. S: His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and what is between them two and what is beneath the ground. 020.007 Y: If thou pronounce the word aloud, (it is no matter): for verily He knoweth what is secret and what is yet more hidden. P: And if thou speakest aloud, then lo! He knoweth the secret (thought) and (that which is yet) more hidden. S: And if you utter the saying aloud, then surely He knows the secret, and what is yet more hidden. 020.008 Y: God! there is no god but He! To Him belong the most Beautiful Names. P: God! There is no God save Him. His are the most beautiful names. S: God there is no god but He; His are the very best names. 020.009 Y: Has the story of Moses reached thee? P: Hath there come unto thee the story of Moses? S: And has the story of Musa come to you? 020.010 Y: Behold, he saw a fire: So he said to his family, "Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; perhaps I can bring you some burning brand therefrom, or find some guidance at the fire." P: When he saw a fire and said unto his folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off. Peradventure I may bring you a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire. S: When he saw fire, he said to his family: Stop, for surely I see a fire, haply I may bring to you therefrom a live coal or find a guidance at the fire. 020.011 Y: But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard: "O Moses!" P: And when he reached it, he was called by name: O Moses! S: So when he came to it, a voice was uttered: O Musa: 020.012 Y: "Verily I am thy Lord! therefore (in My presence) put off thy shoes: thou art in the sacred valley Tuwa." P: Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord. So take off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy valley of Tuwa. S: Surely I am your Lord, therefore put off your shoes; surely you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa, 020.013 Y: "I have chosen thee: listen, then, to the inspiration (sent to thee)." P: And I have chosen thee, so hearken unto that which is inspired. S: And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed: 020.014 Y: "Verily, I am God: There is no god but I: So serve thou Me (only), and establish regular prayer for celebrating My praise." P: Lo! I, even I, am God, There is no God save Me. So serve Me and establish worship for My remembrance. S: Surely I am God, there is no god but I, therefore serve Me and keep up prayer for My remembrance: 020.015 Y: "Verily the Hour is coming - My design is to keep it hidden - for every soul to receive its reward by the measure of its Endeavour." P: Lo! the Hour is surely coming. But I will to keep it hidden, that every soul may be rewarded for that which it striveth (to achieve). S: Surely the hour is coming I am about to make it manifest so that every soul may be rewarded as it strives: 020.016 Y: "Therefore let not such as believe not therein but follow their own lusts, divert thee therefrom, lest thou perish!" P: Therefore, let not him turn thee aside from (the thought of) it who believeth not therein but followeth his own desire, lest thou perish. S: Therefore let not him who believes not in it and follows his low desires turn you away from it so that you should perish; 020.017 Y: "And what is that in the right hand, O Moses?" P: And what is that in thy right hand, O Moses? S: And what is this in your right hand, O Musa! 020.018 Y: He said, "It is my rod: on it I lean; with it I beat down fodder for my flocks; and in it I find other uses." P: He said: This is my staff whereon I lean, and wherewith I bear down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses. S: He said: This is my staff: I recline on it and I beat the leaves with it to make them fall upon my sheep, and I have other uses for it. 020.019 Y: (God) said, "Throw it, O Moses!" P: He said: Cast it down, O Moses! S: He said: Cast it down, O Musa! 020.020 Y: He threw it, and behold! It was a snake, active in motion. P: So he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, gliding. S: So he cast it down; and lo! it was a serpent running. 020.021 Y: (God) said, "Seize it, and fear not: We shall return it at once to its former condition." P: He said: Grasp it and"On the day when their tongues, hands, and feet will bear witness against them as to their actions. On that Day, God will pay them back their just dues, and they will realize that God is the Truth, making all things manifest. Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure; and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity. These are not affected by what people say; for them, there is forgiveness and an honorable provision.

O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. If you find no one in the house, do not enter until permission is given to you. If you are asked to go back, go back; this is purer for you. It is no fault on your part to enter houses not used for living in, which serve some other use for you. God has knowledge of what you reveal and what you conceal.

Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that will make for greater purity for them. And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof. They should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, fathers, husbands' fathers, sons, husbands' sons, brothers, brothers' sons, sisters' sons, their women, slaves, male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex. Let them not strike their feet to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. Turn to God all together, O believers, that you may attain bliss.

Marry those among you who are single, or the virtuous ones among yourselves, male or female. If they are in poverty, God will give them means out of His grace. Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste until God gives them means out of His grace. If any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing to earn their freedom, give them such a deed if you know any good in them. Do not compel your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order to make a gain in the goods of this life. If anyone compels them, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

We have already sent down to you verses making things clear, an illustration from the story of people who passed away before you, and an admonition for those who fear God. God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as if there were a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp enclosed in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it. Light upon Light! God guides whom He will to His Light. God sets forth parables for men, and God knows all things.

This Light is found in houses which God has permitted to be raised to honor, for the celebration of His name. In them, He is glorified in the mornings and evenings by men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the remembrance of God, nor from regular prayer, nor from the practice of regular charity. Their only fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed."Neither business nor selling diverts from the remembrance of God and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of poor-rate; they fear a day in which the hearts and eyes shall turn about. That God may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace: for God provides for those whom He will, without measure. But the Unbelievers, their deeds are like a mirage in sandy deserts, which the man parched with thirst mistakes for water; until when he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing: But he finds God with him, and God will pay him his account: and God is swift in taking account. Or the Unbelievers' state is like the depths of darkness in a vast deep ocean, overwhelmed with billow topped by billow, topped by dark clouds: depths of darkness, one above another: if a man stretches out his hands, he can hardly see it! For any to whom God gives not light, there is no light! Seest thou not that it is God Whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do celebrate, and the birds with wings outspread? Each one knows its own mode of prayer and praise. And God knows well all that they do. Yea, to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to God is the final goal of all. Seest thou not that God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a heap? Then wilt thou see rain issue forth from their midst. And He sends down from the sky mountain masses of clouds wherein is hail: He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases, the vivid flash of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight. It is God Who alternates the Night and the Day: verily in these things is an instructive example for those who have vision! And God has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. God creates what He wills for verily God has power over all things. We have indeed sent down signs that make things manifest: and God guides whom He wills to a way that is straight. They say, 'We believe in God and in the messenger, and we obey': but even after that, some of them turn away: they are not really Believers. When they are summoned to God and His messenger, in order that He may judge between them, behold some of them decline to come. But if the right is on their side, they come to him with all submission. Is it that there is a disease in their hearts? Or do they doubt, or are they in fear, that God and His Messenger will deal unjustly with them? Nay, it is they themselves who do wrong. The answer of the Believers, when summoned to God and His Messenger, in order that He may judge between them, is no other than this: they say, 'We hear and we obey': it is such as these that will attain felicity. It is such as obey God and His Messenger, and fear God and do right, that will win in the end. They swear their strongest oaths by God that, if only thou wouldst command them, they would leave their homes. Say: 'Swear ye not; Obedience is more reasonable; verily, God is well acquainted with all that ye do.' Say: 'Obey God, and obey the Messenger: but if ye turn away, he is only responsible for the duty placed on him and ye for that placed on you. If ye obey him, ye shall be on right guidance. The Messenger's duty is only to preach the clear Message.' God has promised, to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds, that He will, of a surety, grant them in the land, inheritance of power, as He granted it to those before them; that He will establish in authority their religion - the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change their state, after the fear in which they lived, to one of security and peace: 'They will worship Me alone and not associate aught with Me.' If any do reject Faith after this, they are rebellious and wicked.""Believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers those before them, and that He will most certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and that He will most certainly, after their fear, give them security in exchange; they shall serve Me, not associating aught with Me; and whoever is ungrateful after this, these it is who are the transgressors. So establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and obey the Messenger; that ye may receive mercy. Never think thou that the Unbelievers are going to frustrate (God's Plan) on earth: their abode is the Fire, and it is indeed an evil refuge! O ye who believe! let those whom your right hands possess, and the children among you who have not come of age ask your permission before they come to your presence, on three occasions: before morning prayer; the while ye doff your clothes for the noonday heat; and after the late-night prayer: these are your three times of undress: outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about attending to each other: Thus does God make clear the Signs to you: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom. But when the children among you come of age, let them also ask for permission, as do those senior to them in age: Thus does God make clear His Signs to you: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom. Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage, there is no blame on them if they lay aside their outer garments, provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty: but it is best for them to be modest: and God is One Who sees and knows all things. It is no fault in the blind nor in one born lame, nor in one afflicted with illness, nor in yourselves, that ye should eat in your own houses, or those of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your father's brothers or your father's sisters, or your mother's brothers, or your mother's sisters, or in houses of which the keys are in your possession, or in the house of a sincere friend of yours: there is no blame on you, whether ye eat in company or separately. But if ye enter houses, salute each other with a greeting of blessing and purity as from God. Thus does God make clear the signs to you: that ye may understand. Only those are believers, who believe in God and His Messenger: when they are with him on a matter requiring collective action, they do not depart until they have asked for his leave; those who ask for thy leave are those who believe in God and His Messenger; so when they ask for thy leave, for some business of theirs, give leave to those of them whom thou wilt, and ask God for their forgiveness: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another: God doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them. Be quite sure that to God doth belong whatever is in the heavens and on earth. Well doth He know what ye are intent upon: and one day they will be brought back to Him, and He will tell them the truth of what they did: for God doth know all things.""fear not. We shall return it to its former state." S: He said: "Take hold of it and fear not; We will restore it to its former state." 020.022 Y: "Now draw thy hand close to thy side: It shall come forth white (and shining), without harm (or stain),- as another Sign,"- P: "And thrust thy hand within thine armpit, it will come forth white without hurt. (That will be) another token." S: "And press your hand to your side, it shall come out white without evil: another sign." 020.023 Y: "In order that We may show thee (two) of our Greater Signs." P: "That We may show thee (some) of Our greater portents," S: "That We may show you of Our greater signs." 020.024 Y: "Go thou to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds." P: "Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds)." S: "Go to Firon, surely he has exceeded all limits." 020.025 Y: (Moses) said: "O my Lord! expand me my breast;" P: (Moses) said: "My Lord! relieve my mind." S: He said: "O my Lord! Expand my breast for me," 020.026 Y: "Ease my task for me;" P: "And ease my task for me;" S: "And make my affair easy to me," 020.027 Y: "And remove the impediment from my speech," P: "And loose a knot from my tongue," S: "And loose the knot from my tongue," 020.028 Y: "So they may understand what I say:" P: "That they may understand my saying." S: "(That) they may understand my word;" 020.029 Y: "And give me a Minister from my family," P: "Appoint for me a henchman from my folk," S: "And give to me an aider from my family:" 020.030 Y: "Aaron, my brother;" P: "Aaron, my brother." S: "Haroun, my brother," 020.031 Y: "Add to my strength through him," P: "Confirm my strength with him." S: "Strengthen my back by him," 020.032 Y: "And make him share my task:" P: "And let him share my task," S: "And associate him (with me) in my affair," 020.033 Y: "That we may celebrate Thy praise without stint," P: "That we may glorify Thee much." S: "So that we should glorify Thee much," 020.034 Y: "And remember Thee without stint:" P: "And much remember Thee." S: "And remember Thee oft." 020.035 Y: "For Thou art He that (ever) regardeth us." P: "Lo! Thou art ever Seeing us." S: "Surely, Thou art seeing us." 020.036 Y: (God) said: "Granted is thy prayer, O Moses!" P: He said: "Thou art granted thy request, O Moses." S: He said: "You are indeed granted your petition, O Musa." 020.037 Y: "And indeed We conferred a favour on thee another time (before)." P: "And indeed, another time, already We have shown thee favour," S: "And certainly We bestowed on you a favor at another time;" 020.038 Y: "Behold! We sent to thy mother, by inspiration, the message:" P: "When we inspired in thy mother that which is inspired," S: "When We revealed to your mother what was revealed;" 020.039 Y: "'Throw (the child) into the chest, and throw (the chest) into the river: the river will cast him up on the bank, and he will be taken up by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him': But I cast (the garment of) love over thee from Me: and (this) in order that thou mayest be reared under Mine eye." P: "Saying: Throw him into the ark, and throw it into the river, then the river shall throw it on to the bank, and there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall take him. And I endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be trained according to My will," S: "Saying: Put him into a chest, then cast it down into the river, then the river shall throw him on the shore; there shall take him up one who is an enemy to Me and enemy to him, and I cast down upon you love from Me, and that you might be brought up before My eyes;" 020.040 Y: "Behold! thy sister goeth forth and saith, 'shall I show you one who will nurse and rear the (child)?' So We brought thee back to thy mother, that her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve. Then thou didst slay a man, but We saved thee from trouble, and We tried thee in various ways. Then didst thou tarry a number of years with the people of Midian. Then didst thou come hither as ordained, O Moses!" P: "When thy sister went and said: Shall I show you one who will nurse him? and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not sorrow. And thou didst kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress, and tried thee with a heavy trial. And thou didst tarry years among the folk of Midian. Then camest thou (hither) by (My) providence, O Moses," S: "When your sister went and said: Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him? So We brought you back to your mother, that her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve and you killed a man, then We delivered you from the grief, and We tried you with (a severe) trying. Then you stayed for years among the people of Madyan; then you came hither as ordained, O Musa." 020.041 Y: "And I have prepared thee for Myself (for service)." P: "And I have attached thee to Myself." S: "And I have chosen you for Myself." 020.042 Y: "Go, thou and thy brother, with My Signs, and slacken not, either of you, in keeping Me in remembrance." P: "Go, thou and thy brother, with My tokens, and be not faint in remembrance of Me." S: "Go you and your brother with My communications and be not remiss in remembering Me;" 020.043 Y: "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds;" P: "Go, both of you, unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds)." S: "Go both to Firon, surely he has become inordinate;" 020.044 Y: "But speak to him mildly; perchance he may take warning or fear (God)." P: "And speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear." S: "Then speak to him a gentle word haply he may mind or fear." 020.045 Y: They (Moses and Aaron) said: "Our Lord! We fear lest he hasten with insolence against us, or lest he transgress all bounds." P: They said: "Our Lord! Lo! we fear that he may be beforehand with us or that he may play the tyrant." S: Both said: "O our Lord! Surely we fear that he may hasten to do evil to us or that he may become inordinate." 020.046 Y: He said: "Fear not: for I am with you: I hear and see (everything)." P: He said: "Fear not. Lo! I am with you twain, Hearing and Seeing." S: He said: "Fear not, surely I am with you both: I do hear and see." 020.047 Y: "So go ye both to him, and say, 'Verily we are messengers sent by thy Lord: Send forth, therefore, the Children of Israel with us, and afflict them not: with a Sign, indeed, have we come from thy Lord! and peace to all who follow guidance!'" P: "So go ye unto him and say: Lo! we are two messengers of thy Lord. So let the children of Israel go with us, and torment them not. We bring thee a token from thy Lord. And peace will be for him who followeth right guidance." S: "So go you both to him and say: Surely we are two messengers of your Lord; therefore send the children of Israel with us and do not torment them! Indeed we have brought to you a communication from your Lord, and peace is on him who follows the guidance;" 020.048 Y: "'Verily it has been revealed to us that the Penalty (awaits) those who reject and turn away.'" P: "Lo! it hath been revealed unto us that the doom will be for him who denieth and turneth away." S: "Surely it has been revealed to us that the chastisement will surely come upon him who rejects and turns back." 020.049 Y: (When this message was delivered), (Pharaoh) said: "Who, then, O Moses, is the Lord of you two?" P: (Pharaoh) said: "Who then is the Lord of you twain, O Moses?" S: (Firon) said: "And who is your Lord, O Musa?" 020.050 Y: He said: "Our Lord is He Who gave to each (created) thing its form and nature, and further, gave (it) guidance." P: He said: "Our Lord is He Who gave unto everything its nature, then guided it aright." S: He said: "Our Lord is He Who gave to everything its creation, then guided it (to its goal)." 020.051 Y: (Pharaoh) said: "What then is the condition of previous generations?" P: He said: "What then is the state of the generations of old?" S: He said: "Then what is the state of the former generations?" 020.052 Y: He replied: "The knowledge of that is with my Lord, duly recorded: my Lord never errs, nor forgets,"- P: He said: "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord neither erreth nor forgetteth," S: He said: "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a book, my Lord errs not, nor does He forget;" 020.053 Y: "He Who has made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabled you to go about therein by roads (and channels); and has sent down water from the sky." With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate from the others. P: "Who hath appointed the earth as a bed and hath threaded roads for you therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby We have brought forth divers kinds of vegetation," S: "Who made the earth for you an expanse and made for you therein paths and sent down water from the cloud; then thereby We have brought forth many species of various herbs." 020.054 Y: "Eat (for yourselves) and pasture your cattle: verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding." P: "(Saying): Eat ye and feed your cattle. Lo! herein verily are portents for men of thought." S: "Eat and pasture your cattle; most surely there are signs in this for those endowed with understanding." 020.055 Y: "From the (earth) did We create you, and into it shall We return you, and from it shall We bring you out once again." P: "Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return you, and thence We bring you forth a second time." S: "From it We created you and into it We shall send you back and from it will We raise you a second time." 020.056 Y: "And We showed Pharaoh all Our Signs, but he did reject and refuse." P: "And We verily did show him all Our tokens, but he denied them and refused." S: "And truly We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he rejected and refused." 020.057 Y: He said: "Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic, O Moses?" P: He said: "Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic, O Moses?" S: Said he: "Have you come to us that you should turn us out of our land by your magic, O Musa?" 020.058 Y: "But we can surely produce magic to match thine! So make a tryst between us and thee, which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - in a place where both shall have even chances." P: "But we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof; so appoint a tryst between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place convenient (to us both)." S: "So we too will produce before you magic like it, therefore make between us and you an appointment, which we should not break, (neither) we nor you, (in) a central place." 020.059 Y: Moses said: "Your tryst is the Day of the Festival, and let the people be assembled when the sun is well up." P: (Moses) said: "Your tryst shall be the day of the feast, and let the people assemble when the sun hath risen high." S: (Musa) said: "Your appointment is the day of the Festival and let the people be gathered together in the early forenoon." 020.060 Y: So Pharaoh withdrew: He concerted his plan, and then came (back). P: Then Pharaoh went and gathered his stMoses said to him: "Woe to you! Do not forge a lie against God, lest He destroy you by chastisement. The forger must suffer frustration!" They disputed among themselves but kept their talk secret. They said: "These two are expert magicians aiming to drive you out from your land with their magic and to do away with your cherished institutions." They planned and assembled in ranks, saying, "He who gains the upper hand today will be successful."

They asked Moses if he would throw first or if they should. Moses told them to throw first. Their ropes and rods appeared to move due to their magic, causing Moses to feel fear. God reassured him, saying, "Fear not! You have the upper hand. Throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow what they have faked. A magician's trick will not succeed."

The magicians then prostrated, declaring belief in the Lord of Aaron and Moses. Pharaoh accused them of believing without his permission and threatened severe punishment. The magicians responded that they would not prefer Pharaoh over the clear signs and the Creator. They accepted whatever decree Pharaoh made, knowing it only affected this life. They believed in their Lord, seeking forgiveness for their sins and the magic they were compelled to perform, acknowledging God as the Best and Most Abiding.

Those who come to their Lord as sinners will face Hell, where they will neither die nor live. Believers who have done righteous deeds will have exalted ranks and dwell in Gardens of Eternity. God inspired Moses to travel by night with His servants and strike a dry path through the sea. Pharaoh pursued them, but the waters overwhelmed him and his forces. Pharaoh led his people astray.

God reminded the Children of Israel of their deliverance from the enemy, the covenant made on Mount Sinai, and the provision of manna and quails. They were warned to eat the good things provided without excess, lest they face God's wrath. God is forgiving to those who repent, believe, do good, and follow the right path.

When Moses was on the Mount, God asked why he hastened ahead of his people. Moses replied that they were close behind, and he hastened to please God. God informed him that his people were tested in his absence and led astray by the Samiri. Moses returned to his people in indignation and sorrow, questioning why they broke their promise.Moses said to them, "Did the time seem long to you, or did you wish for displeasure from your Lord, so you broke your promise to me?" They replied, "We did not break the promise of our own will, but we were burdened with the ornaments of the people, and we threw them into the fire as the Samiri suggested." The Samiri then produced a calf from the fire, which seemed to low, and they said, "This is your god and the god of Moses, but Moses has forgotten!" They could not see that it could neither return a word nor harm or benefit them.

Aaron had already warned them, "O my people! You are being tested with this; your Lord is Most Gracious, so follow me and obey my command." But they insisted, "We will not abandon this cult until Moses returns." When Moses returned, he said to Aaron, "What kept you back when you saw them going wrong? Did you disobey my order?" Aaron replied, "O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard or hair. I feared you would say I caused division among the children of Israel and did not respect your word."

Moses then asked the Samiri, "What is your case?" The Samiri replied, "I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful of dust from the footprint of the Messenger and threw it into the calf. Thus my soul suggested to me." Moses said, "Get away! Your punishment in this life will be to say, 'Touch me not,' and you have a promise that will not fail. Look at your god, which you worshipped; we will burn it and scatter its ashes in the sea. Your God is only God, who comprehends all things in His knowledge."

Thus, We relate to you some stories of what happened before, and We have sent you a Message from Our presence. Whoever turns away from it will bear a burden on the Day of Judgment, abiding in this state, and it will be a grievous burden. On the Day when the Trumpet is sounded, We will gather the sinful, blear-eyed with terror. They will whisper among themselves, "You tarried not longer than ten days." We know best what they will say when their leader says, "You tarried but a day."

They ask you about the mountains. Say, "My Lord will uproot them and scatter them as dust, leaving them as smooth, level plains where you will see neither curve nor ruggedness." On that Day, they will follow the Caller straight, and all sounds will humble themselves in the presence of God Most Gracious. No intercession will avail except for those granted permission by God. He knows what is before and behind them, but they cannot comprehend it in knowledge. All faces will be humbled before the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal, and those who bear iniquity will be failures. But those who do righteous deeds and have faith will have no fear of harm or curtailment.

Thus, We have sent down an Arabic Qur'an and explained in detail some warnings, so they may fear God or remember Him. High above all is God, the King, the Truth! Do not be in haste with the Qur'an before its revelation is completed, but say, "O my Lord! Increase me in knowledge."This is naught but a lie that he hath invented, and other folk have helped him with it, so that they have produced a slander and a lie. And those who disbelieve say: This is nothing but a lie which he has forged, and other people have helped him at it; so indeed they have done injustice and uttered a falsehood. And they say: Tales of the ancients, which he has caused to be written: and they are dictated before him morning and evening. And they say: Fables of the men of old which he hath had written down so that they are dictated to him morn and evening. And they say: The stories of the ancients he has got them written so these are read out to him morning and evening. Say: The Qur'an was sent down by Him who knows the mystery in the heavens and the earth: verily He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: He who knoweth the secret of the heavens and the earth hath revealed it. Lo! He ever is Forgiving, Merciful. Say: He has revealed it Who knows the secret in the heavens and the earth; surely He is ever Forgiving, Merciful. And they say: What sort of a messenger is this, who eats food, and walks through the streets? Why has not an angel been sent down to him to give admonition with him? And they say: What aileth this messenger that he eateth food and walketh in the markets? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a warner with him. And they say: What is the matter with this Messenger that he eats food and goes about in the markets; why has not an angel been sent down to him, so that he should have been a warner with him? Or why has not a treasure been bestowed on him, or why has he not a garden for enjoyment? The wicked say: Ye follow none other than a man bewitched. Or why is not treasure thrown down unto him, or why hath he not a paradise from whence to eat? And the evil-doers say: Ye are but following a man bewitched. Or why is not a treasure sent down to him, or he is made to have a garden from which he should eat? And the unjust say: You do not follow any but a man deprived of reason. See what kinds of comparisons they make for thee! But they have gone astray, and never a way will they be able to find! See how they coin similitudes for thee, so that they are all astray and cannot find a road! See what likenesses do they apply to you, so they have gone astray, therefore they shall not be able to find a way. Blessed is He who, if that were His will, could give thee better things than those, Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and He could give thee palaces secure to dwell in. Blessed is He Who, if He will, will assign thee better than all that - Gardens underneath which rivers flow - and will assign thee mansions. Blessed is He Who, if He please, will give you what is better than this, gardens beneath which rivers flow, and He will give you palaces. Nay they deny the hour of the judgment to come: but We have prepared a blazing fire for such as deny the hour. Nay, but they deny the coming of the Hour, and for those who deny the coming of the Hour We have prepared a flame. But they reject the hour, and We have prepared a burning fire for him who rejects the hour. When it sees them from a place far off, they will hear its fury and its ranging sigh. When it seeth them from afar, they hear the crackling and the roar thereof. When it shall come into their sight from a distant place, they shall hear its vehement raging and roaring. And when they are cast, bound together into a constricted place therein, they will plead for destruction there and then! And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they pray for destruction there. And when they are cast into a narrow place in it, bound, they shall there call out for destruction. This day plead not for a single destruction: plead for destruction oft-repeated! Pray not that day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions! Call not this day for one destruction, but call for destructions many. Say: Is that best, or the eternal garden, promised to the righteous? for them, that is a reward as well as a goal of attainment. Say: Is that doom better or the Garden of Immortality which is promised unto those who ward off evil? It will be their reward and journey's end. Say: Is this better or the abiding garden which those who guard against evil are promised? That shall be a reward and a resort for them. For them there will be therein all that they wish for: they will dwell there for aye: A promise to be prayed for from thy Lord. Therein abiding, they have all that they desire. It is for thy Lord a promise that must be fulfilled. They shall have therein what they desire abiding in it; it is a promise which it is proper to be prayed for from your Lord. The day He will gather them together as well as those whom they worship besides God, He will ask: Was it ye who let these My servants astray, or did they stray from the Path themselves? And on the day when He will assemble them and that which they worship instead of God and will say: Was it ye who misled these My slaves or did they themselves wander from the way? And on the day when He shall gather them, and whatever they served besides God, He shall say: Was it you who led astray these My servants, or did they themselves go astray from the path? They will say: Glory to Thee! not meet was it for us that we should take for protectors others besides Thee: But Thou didst bestow, on them and their fathers, good things in life, until they forgot the Message: for they were a people worthless and lost. They will say: Be Thou Glorified! it was not for us to choose any protecting friends beside thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease till they forgot the warning and became lost folk. They shall say: Glory be to Thee; it was not beseeming for us that we should take any guardians besides Thee, but Thou didst make them and their fathers to enjoy until they forsook the reminder, and they were a people in perdition. God will say: Now have they proved you liars in what ye say: so ye cannot avert your penalty nor get help. And whoever among you does wrong, him shall We cause to taste of a grievous Penalty. Thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say, then ye can neither avert the doom nor obtain help. And whoso among you doeth wrong, We shall make him taste great torment. So they shall indeed give you the lie in what you say, then you shall not be able to ward off or help, and whoever among you is unjust, We will make him taste a great chastisement. And the messengers whom We sent before thee were all men who ate food and walked through the streets: We have made some of you as a trial for others: will ye have patience? for God is One Who sees all things. We never sent before thee any messengers but lo! they verily ate food and walked in the markets. And We have appointed some of you a test for others: Will ye be steadfast? And thy Lord is ever Seer. And We have not sent before you any messengers but they most surely ate food and went about in the markets; and We have made some of you a trial for others; will you bear patiently? And your Lord is ever Seeing. Such as fear not the meeting with Us for Judgment say: Why are not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord? Indeed they have an arrogant conceit of themselves, and mighty is the insolence of their impiety! And those who look not for a meeting with Us say: Why are angels not sent down unto us and Why do we not see our Lord! Assuredly they think too highly of themselves and are scornful with great pride. And those who do not hope for Our meeting, say: Why have not angels been sent down upon us, or why do we not see our Lord? Now certainly they are too proud of themselves and have revolted in great revolt. The Day they see the angels, no joy will there be to the sinners that Day: The angels will say: There is a barrier forbidden to you altogether! On the day when they behold the angels, on that day there will be no good tidings for the guilty; and they will cry: A forbidding ban! On the day when they shall see the angels, there shall be no joy on that day for the guilty, and they shall say: It is a forbidden thing totally prohibited. And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did in this life, and We shall make such deeds as floating dust scattered about. And We shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes. And We will proceed to what they have done of deeds, so We shall render them as scattered floating dust. The Companions of the Garden will be well, that Day, in their abode, and have the fairest of places for repose. Those who have earned the Garden on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest. The dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in a better abiding-place and a better resting-place. The Day the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and angels shall be sent down, descending in ranks. A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels will be sent down, a grand descent. And on the day when the heaven shall burst asunder with the clouds, and the angels shall be sent down descending in ranks. That Day, the dominion as of right and truth, shall be wholly for God Most Merciful: it will be a Day of dire difficulty for the Misbelievers. The Sovereignty on that day will be the True Sovereignty belonging to the Beneficent One, and it will be a hard day for disbelievers. The kingdom on that day shall rightly belong to the Beneficent God, and a hard day shall it be for the unbelievers. The Day that the wrong-doer will bite at his hands, he will say, Oh! would that I had taken a straight path with the Messenger! On the day when the wrong-doer gnaweth his hands, he will say: Ah, would that I had chosen a way together with the messenger! And the day when the unjust one shall bite his hands saying: O! would that I had taken a way with the Messenger; Ah! woe is me! Would that I had never taken such a one for a friend! Alas for me! Ah, would that I had never taken such a one for friend! O woe is me! would that I had not taken such a one for a friend! He did lead me astray from the Message of God after it had come to me! Ah! the Evil One is but a traitor to man! He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan was ever man's deserter in the hour of need. Certainly he led me astray from the reminder afterThe King, the Truth, and do not make haste with the Quran before its revelation is made complete to you and say: O my Lord! increase me in knowledge. We had already, beforehand, taken the covenant of Adam, but he forgot: and We found on his part no firm resolve. When We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves to Adam," they prostrated themselves, but not Iblis: he refused. Then We said: "O Adam! verily, this is an enemy to thee and thy wife: so let him not get you both out of the Garden, so that thou art landed in misery." There is therein (enough provision) for thee not to go hungry nor to go naked, nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the sun's heat. But Satan whispered evil to him: he said, "O Adam! shall I lead thee to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?" In the result, they both ate of the tree, and so their nakedness appeared to them: they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden: thus did Adam disobey his Lord, and allow himself to be seduced. But his Lord chose him (for His Grace): He turned to him, and gave him Guidance. He said: "Get ye down, both of you, all together, from the Garden, with enmity one to another: but if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from Me, whosoever follows My Guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall into misery." But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a life narrowed down, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment. He will say: "O my Lord! why hast Thou raised me up blind, while I had sight (before)?" (God) will say: "Thus didst Thou, when Our Signs came unto thee, disregard them: so wilt thou, this day, be disregarded." And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes not in the Signs of his Lord: and the Penalty of the Hereafter is far more grievous and more enduring. Is it not a warning to such men (to call to mind) how many generations before them We destroyed, in whose haunts they (now) move? Verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (their punishment) must necessarily have come; but there is a Term appointed (for respite). Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun, and before its setting; yea, celebrate them for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day: that thou mayest have (spiritual) joy. Nor strain thine eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to parties of them, the splendour of the life of this world, through which We test them: but the provision of thy Lord is better and more enduring. Enjoin prayer on thy people, and be constant therein. We ask thee not to provide sustenance: We provide it for thee. But the (fruit of) the Hereafter is for righteousness. They say: "Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?" Has not a Clear Sign come to them of all that was in the former Books of revelation? And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this, they would have said: "Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent us a messenger, we should certainly have followed Thy Signs before we were humbled and put to shame." Say: "Each one (of us) is waiting: wait ye, therefore, and soon shall ye know who it is that is on the straight and even way, and who it is that has received Guidance." Closer and closer to mankind comes their Reckoning: yet they heed not and they turn away. Never comes (aught) to them of a renewed Message from their Lord, but they listen to it as in jest, their hearts toying as with trifles. The wrong-doers conceal their private counsels, (saying), "Is this (one) more than a man like yourselves? Will ye go to witchcraft with your eyes open?"Then the Messenger will say: "O my Lord! Truly my people took this Qur'an for just foolish nonsense." And the messenger saith: O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Qur'an of no account. And the Messenger cried out: O my Lord! surely my people have treated this Quran as a forsaken thing.

Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners: but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help. Even so have We appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the guilty; but God sufficeth for a Guide and Helper. And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from among the sinners and sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and a Helper.

Those who reject Faith say: "Why is not the Qur'an revealed to him all at once? Thus (is it revealed), that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and We have rehearsed it to thee in slow, well-arranged stages, gradually." And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur'an not revealed unto him all at once? (It is revealed) thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith; and We have arranged it in right order. And those who disbelieve say: Why has not the Quran been revealed to him all at once? Thus, that We may strengthen your heart by it and We have arranged it well in arranging.

And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth and the best explanation (thereof). And they bring thee no similitude but We bring thee the Truth (as against it), and better (than their similitude) as argument. And they shall not bring to you any argument, but We have brought to you (one) with truth and best in significance.

Those who will be gathered to Hell (prone) on their faces,- they will be in an evil plight, and, as to Path, most astray. Those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell: such are worse in plight and further from the right road. (As for) those who shall be gathered upon their faces to hell, they are in a worse plight and straying farther away from the path.

(Before this,) We sent Moses The Book, and appointed his brother Aaron with him as minister; We verily gave Moses the Scripture and placed with him his brother Aaron as henchman. And certainly We gave Musa the Book and We appointed with him his brother Haroun an aider.

And We command: "Go ye both, to the people who have rejected our Signs:" And those (people) We destroyed with utter destruction. Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations. Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction. Then We said: Go you both to the people who rejected Our communications; so We destroyed them with utter destruction.

And the people of Noah,- when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and We made them as a Sign for mankind; and We have prepared for (all) wrong-doers a grievous Penalty; And Noah's folk, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and made of them a portent for mankind. We have prepared a painful doom for evil-doers. And the people of Nuh, when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and made them a sign for men, and We have prepared a painful punishment for the unjust;

As also 'Ad and Thamud, and the Companions of the Rass, and many a generation between them. And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud, and the dwellers in Ar-Rass, and many generations in between. And Ad and Samood and the dwellers of the Rass and many generations between them.

To each one We set forth Parables and examples; and each one We broke to utter annihilation (for their sins). Each (of them) We warned by examples, and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin. And to every one We gave examples and every one did We destroy with utter destruction.

And the (Unbelievers) must indeed have passed by the town on which was rained a shower of evil: did they not then see it (with their own eyes)? But they fear not the Resurrection. And indeed they have passed by the township whereon was rained the fatal rain. Can it be that they have not seen it? Nay, but they hope for no resurrection. And certainly they have (often) passed by the town on which was rained an evil rain; did they not then see it? Nay! they did not hope to be raised again.

When they see thee, they treat thee no otherwise than in mockery: "Is this the one whom God has sent as a messenger?" And when they see thee (O Muhammad) they treat thee only as a jest (saying): Is this he whom God sendeth as a messenger? And when they see you, they do not take you for aught but a mockery: Is this he whom God has raised to be a messenger?

"He indeed would well-nigh have misled us from our gods, had it not been that we were constant to them!" - Soon will they know, when they see the Penalty, who it is that is most misled in Path! He would have led us far away from our gods if we had not been staunch to them. They will know, when they behold the doom, who is more astray as to the road. He had well-nigh led us astray from our gods had we not adhered to them patiently! And they will know, when they see the punishment, who is straying farther off from the path.

Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion (or impulse)? Couldst thou be a disposer of affairs for him? Hast thou seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust? Wouldst thou then be guardian over him? Have you seen him who takes his low desires for his god? Will you then be a protector over him?

Or thinkest thou that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle; nay, they are worse astray in Path. Or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand? They are but as the cattle - nay, but they are farther astray? Or do you think that most of them do hear or understand? They are nothing but as cattle; nay, they are straying farther off from the path.

Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord?- How He doth prolong the shadow! If He willed, He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun its guide; Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade - And if He willed He could have made it still - then We have made the sun its pilot; Have you not considered (the work of) your Lord, how He extends the shade? And if He had pleased He would certainly have made it stationary; then We have made the sun an indication of it;

Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages. Then We withdraw it unto Us, a gradual withdrawal? Then We take it to Ourselves, taking little by little.

And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you, and Sleep as Repose, and makes the Day (as it were) a Resurrection. And He it is Who maketh night a covering for you, and sleep repose, and maketh day a resurrection. And He it is Who made the night a covering for you, and the sleep a rest, and He made the day to rise up again.

And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky, And He it is Who sendeth the winds, glad tidings heralding His mercy, and We send down purifying water from the sky, And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy; and We send down pure water from the cloud,

That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things We have created,- cattle and men in great numbers. That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give many beasts and men that We have created to drink thereof. That We may give life thereby to a dead land and give it for drink, out of what We have created, to cattle and many people.

And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may celebrate (our) praises, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank) ingratitude. And verily We have repeated it among them that they may remember, but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude. And certainly We have repeated this to them that they may be mindful, but the greater number of men do not consent to aught except denying.

Had it been Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every centre of population. If We willed, We could raise up a warner in every village. And if We had pleased We would certainly have raised a warner in every town.

Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur'an). So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith with a great endeavour. So do not follow the unbelievers, and strive against them a mighty striving with it.

It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water: One palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter; yet has He made a barrier between them, a partition that is forbidden to be passed. And He it is Who hath given independence to the two seas (though they meet); one palatable, sweet, and the other saltish, bitter; and hath set a bar and a forbidding ban between them. And He it is Who has made two seas to flow freely, the one sweet that subdues thirst by its sweetness, and the other salt that burns by its saltness; and between the two He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction.

It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power (over all things). And He it is Who hath created man from water, and hath appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage; for thy Lord is ever Powerful. And He it is Who has created man from the water, then He has made for him blood relationship and marriage relationship, and your Lord is powerful.

Yet do they worship, besides God, things that can neither profit them nor harm them: and the Misbeliever is a helper (of Evil), against his own Lord! Yet they worship instead of God that which can neither benefit them nor hurt them. The disbeliever was ever a partisan against his Lord. And they serve besides God that which neither profits them nor causes them harm; and the unbeliever is a partisan against his Lord.

But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition. And We have sent thee (O Muhammad) only as a bearer of good tidings and a warner. And We have not sent you but as a giver of good news and as a warner.

Say: "No reward do I ask of you for it but this: that each one who will may take a (straight) Path to his Lord." Say: I ask of you no reward for this, save that whoso will may choose a way unto his Lord. Say: I do not ask you aught in return except that he who will, may take the way to his Lord.

And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate his praise; and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants."Is other than a mortal like you? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see it?" Their hearts trifling; and those who are unjust counsel together in secret: "He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves; what! will you then yield to enchantment while you see?" Say: "My Lord knoweth every word spoken in the heavens and on earth: He is the One that heareth and knoweth all things." He saith: "My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is the Hearer, the Knower." He said: "My Lord knows what is spoken in the heaven and the earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing." They say, "These are medleys of dreams! - Nay, He forged it! - Nay, He is but a poet! Let him then bring us a Sign like the ones that were sent to Prophets of old!" Nay, say they, "These are but muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it; nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old who were God's messengers were sent with portents." Nay! say they: "Medleys of dreams; nay! he has forged it; nay! he is a poet; so let him bring to us a sign as the former prophets were sent with." As to those before them, not one of the populations which We destroyed believed: will these believe? Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them, though We sent them portents: would they then believe? There did not believe before them any town which We destroyed, will they then believe? Before thee, also, the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We granted inspiration: If ye realize this not, ask of those who possess the Message. And We sent not as Our messengers before thee other than men, whom We inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not. And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation, so ask the followers of the reminder if you do not know. Nor did We give them bodies that ate no food, nor were they exempt from death. We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals. And We did not make them bodies not eating the food, and they were not to abide forever. In the end, We fulfilled to them Our Promise, and We saved them and those whom We pleased, but We destroyed those who transgressed beyond bounds. Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom We would, and We destroyed the prodigals. Then We made Our promise good to them, so We delivered them and those whom We pleased, and We destroyed the extravagant. We have revealed for you a book in which is a Message for you: will ye not then understand? Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have ye then no sense? Certainly We have revealed to you a Book in which is your good remembrance; what! do you not then understand? How many were the populations We utterly destroyed because of their iniquities, setting up in their places other peoples? How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up after them another folk! And how many a town which was iniquitous did We demolish, and We raised up after it another people! Yet, when they felt Our Punishment coming, behold, they tried to flee from it. And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it! So when they felt Our punishment, lo! they began to fly. Flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given you, and to your homes in order that ye may be called to account. But it was said unto them: Flee not, but return to that existence which emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned. Do not fly now and come back to what you were made to lead easy lives in and to your dwellings, haply you will be questioned. They said: "Ah! woe to us! We were indeed wrong-doers!" They cried: "Alas for us! we were wrong-doers." They said: "O woe to us! surely we were unjust." And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is mown, as ashes silent and quenched. And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct. And this ceased not to be their cry till We made them cut. Not for idle sport did We create the heavens and the earth and all that is between! We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play. And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them for sport. If it had been Our wish to take just a pastime, We should surely have taken it from the things nearest to Us, if We would do such a thing! If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence - if We ever did. Had We wished to make a diversion, We would have made it from before Ourselves: by no means would We do it. Nay, We hurl the Truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its brain, and behold, falsehood doth perish! Ah! woe be to you for the false things ye ascribe to Us. Nay, but We hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and lo! it vanisheth. And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe unto Him. Nay! We cast the truth against the falsehood, so that it breaks its head, and lo! it vanishes; and woe to you for what you describe. To Him belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth: Even those who are in His very Presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor are they ever weary of His service. Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary. And whoever is in the heavens and the earth is His; and those who are with Him are not proud to serve Him, nor do they grow weary. They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever flag or intermit. They glorify Him night and day; they flag not. They glorify Him by night and day; they are never languid. Or have they taken for worship gods from the earth who can raise the dead? Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead? Or have they taken gods from the earth who raise the dead. If there were, in the heavens and the earth, other gods besides God, there would have been confusion in both! But glory to God, the Lord of the Throne: High is He above what they attribute to Him! If there were therein gods beside God, then verily both the heavens and the earth had been disordered. Glorified be God, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they ascribe unto Him. If there had been in them any gods except God, they would both have certainly been in a state of disorder; therefore glory be to God, the Lord of the dominion, above what they attribute to Him. He cannot be questioned for His acts, but they will be questioned for theirs. He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be questioned. He cannot be questioned concerning what He does and they shall be questioned. Or have they taken for worship other gods besides Him? Say, "Bring your convincing proof: this is the Message of those with me and the Message of those before me." But most of them know not the Truth, and so turn away. Or have they chosen other gods beside Him? Say: "Bring your proof of their godhead. This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of them know not the Truth and so they are averse." Or, have they taken gods besides Him? Say: "Bring your proof; this is the reminder of those with me and the reminder of those before me. Nay! most of them do not know the truth, so they turn aside." Not a messenger did We send before thee without this inspiration sent by Us to him: that there is no god but I; therefore worship and serve Me. And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, saying: There is no God save Me God, so worship Me. And We did not send before you any messenger but We revealed to him that there is no god but Me, therefore serve Me. And they say: "God Most Gracious has begotten offspring." Glory to Him! they are but servants raised to honour. And they say: "The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He Glorified! Nay, but those whom they call sons are honoured slaves." And they say: "The Beneficent God has taken to Himself a son. Glory be to Him. Nay! they are honored servants." They speak not before He speaks, and they act in all things by His Command. They speak not until He hath spoken, and they act by His command. They do not precede Him in speech and only according to His commandment do they act. He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they offer no intercession except for those who are acceptable, and they stand in awe and reverence of His Glory. He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede except for him whom He accepteth, and they quake for awe of Him. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not intercede except for him whom He approves and for fear of Him they tremble. If any of them should say, "I am a god besides Him," such a one We should reward with Hell: thus do We reward those who do wrong. And one of them who should say: "Lo! I am a god beside Him," that one We should repay with hell. Thus We Repay wrong-doers. And whoever of them should say: "Surely I am a god besides Him," such a one do We recompense with hell; thus do We recompense the unjust. Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit of creation, before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water? Will they not then believe? Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were closed up, but We have opened them; and We have made of water everything living, will they not then believe? And We have set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with them, and We have made therein broad highways between mountains for them to pass through: that they may receive Guidance. And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way. And We have made great mountains in the earth lest it might be convulsed with them, and We have made in it wide ways that they may follow a right direction. And We have made the heavens as a canopy well guarded: yet do they turn away from the Signs which these things point to! And we have made the sky a roof withheld from them. Yet they turn away from it.Trust in the Living One Who does not die, and praise Him. He is sufficient as the Knower of His servants' sins. He created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and is firmly established on the Throne. Ask anyone informed about Him. When it is said to them, "Prostrate to God Most Gracious," they say, "What is God Most Gracious? Shall we prostrate to what you command us?" This increases their aversion.

Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light. He made the Night and the Day to follow each other for those who wish to celebrate His praises or show gratitude. The servants of God Most Gracious walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace." They spend the night in adoration of their Lord, prostrate and standing, and pray, "Our Lord! Avert from us the Wrath of Hell, for its Wrath is indeed an affliction grievous."

They are neither extravagant nor niggardly when they spend, but hold a just balance. They do not invoke any other god with God, nor slay life except for just cause, nor commit fornication. Whoever repents, believes, and works righteous deeds will have their evil deeds changed to good by God, Who is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Those who repent and do good truly turn to God with an acceptable conversion.

They do not witness falsehood and pass by futility with honorable avoidance. When reminded of the Signs of their Lord, they do not droop down as if they were deaf or blind. They pray, "Our Lord! Grant us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and give us the grace to lead the righteous." They will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven because of their patient constancy, met with salutations and peace, dwelling therein forever.

Say to the Rejecters: "My Lord is not uneasy because of you if you do not call on Him. But you have indeed rejected Him, and soon will come the inevitable punishment." 

Chapter 26: AL-SHUARA (THE POETS)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

These are verses of the Book that makes things clear. You may fret your soul with grief that they do not become Believers. If it were Our Will, We could send down to them from the sky a Sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility. But there comes not to them a newly-revealed Message from God Most Gracious, but they turn away from it. They have indeed rejected the Message, so they will soon know the truth of what they mocked at.

Do they not look at the earth and see how many noble things of all kinds We have produced therein? Verily, in this is a Sign, but most of them do not believe. Your Lord is the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. When your Lord called Moses, saying, "Go to the people of iniquity, the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear God?" Moses said, "O my Lord! I do fear that they will charge me with falsehood. My breast will be straitened, and my speech may not go smoothly, so send unto Aaron."It is He Who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course. We granted not to any man before thee permanent life (here): if then thou shouldst die, would they live permanently? Every soul shall have a taste of death: And We test you by evil and by good by way of trial: To Us must ye return. When the Unbelievers see thee, they treat thee not except with ridicule. "Is this," (they say), "the one who talks of your gods?" and they blaspheme at the mention of (God) Most Gracious! Man is a creature of haste: soon (enough) will I show you My Signs; then ye will not ask Me to hasten them! They say: "When will this promise come to pass, if ye are telling the truth?" If only the Unbelievers knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor yet from their backs, and (when) no help can reach them! Nay, it may come to them all of a sudden and confound them: no power will they have then to avert it, nor will they (then) get respite. Mocked were (many) messengers before thee; But their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked. Say: "Who can keep you safe by night and by day from (the Wrath of)(God) Most Gracious?" Yet they turn away from the mention of their Lord. Or have they gods that can guard them from Us? They have no power to aid themselves, nor can they be defended from Us. Nay, We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win? Say, "I do but warn you according to revelation": But the deaf will not hear the call, (even) when they are warned! If but a breath of the Wrath of thy Lord do touch them, they will then say, "Woe to us! we did wrong indeed!" We shall set up scales of justice for the Day of Judgment, so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least, and if there be (no more than) the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it (to account): and enough are We to take account. In the past We granted to Moses and Aaron the criterion (for judgment), and a Light and a Message for those who would do right. Those who fear their Lord in their most secret thoughts, and who hold the Hour (of Judgment) in awe. And this is a blessed Message which We have sent down: will ye then reject it? We bestowed aforetime on Abraham his rectitude of conduct, and well were We acquainted with him. Behold! he said to his father and his people, "What are these images, to which ye are (so assiduously) devoted?" They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them." He said, "Indeed ye have been in manifest error - ye and your fathers." They said, "Have you brought us the Truth, or are you one of those who jest?" He said, "Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, He Who created them (from nothing): and I am a witness to this (Truth)." "And by God, I have a plan for your idols - after ye go away and turn your backs." So he broke them to pieces, (all) but the biggest of them, that they might turn (and address themselves) to it. They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He must indeed be some man of impiety!" They said, "We heard a youth talk of them: He is called Abraham." They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness." They said, "Art thou the one that did this with our gods, O Abraham?" He said: "Nay, this was done by - this is their biggest one! ask them, if they can speak intelligently!" So they turned to themselves and said, "Surely ye are the ones in the wrong!""Thou to Haroun (to help me); 026.014 Y: 'And (further), they have a charge of crime against me; and I fear they may slay me.' P: And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. S: And they have a crime against me, therefore I fear that they may slay me. 026.015 Y: God said: 'By no means! proceed then, both of you, with Our Signs; We are with you, and will listen (to your call).' P: He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing. S: He said: By no means, so go you both with Our signs; surely We are with you, hearing; 026.016 Y: 'So go forth, both of you, to Pharaoh, and say: "We have been sent by the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds;"' P: And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds, S: Then come to Firon and say: Surely we are the messengers of the Lord of the worlds: 026.017 Y: 'Send thou with us the Children of Israel.' P: (Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. S: Then send with us the children of Israel. 026.018 Y: (Pharaoh) said: 'Did we not cherish thee as a child among us, and didst thou not stay in our midst many years of thy life?' P: (Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, S: (Firon) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you tarried among us for (many) years of your life? 026.019 Y: 'And thou didst a deed of thine which (thou knowest) thou didst, and thou art an ungrateful (wretch)!' P: And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates. S: And you did (that) deed of yours which you did, and you are one of the ungrateful. 026.020 Y: Moses said: 'I did it then, when I was in error.' P: He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. S: He said: I did it then while I was of those unable to see the right course; 026.021 Y: 'So I fled from you (all) when I feared you; but my Lord has (since) invested me with judgment (and wisdom) and appointed me as one of the messengers.' P: Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). S: So I fled from you when I feared you, then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me of the messengers; 026.022 Y: 'And this is the favour with which thou dost reproach me,- that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel!' P: And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel. S: And is it a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of Israel? 026.023 Y: Pharaoh said: 'And what is the "Lord and Cherisher of the worlds"?' P: Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds? S: Firon said: And what is the Lord of the worlds? 026.024 Y: (Moses) said: 'The Lord and Cherisher of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- if ye want to be quite sure.' P: (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief. S: He said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would be sure. 026.025 Y: (Pharaoh) said to those around: 'Did ye not listen (to what he says)?' P: (Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not? S: (Firon) said to those around him: Do you not hear? 026.026 Y: (Moses) said: 'Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning!' P: He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. S: He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old. 026.027 Y: (Pharaoh) said: 'Truly your messenger who has been sent to you is a veritable madman!' P: (Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman! S: Said he: Most surely your Messenger who is sent to you is mad. 026.028 Y: (Moses) said: 'Lord of the East and the West, and all between! if ye only had sense!' P: He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand. S: He said: The Lord of the east and the west and what is between them, if you understand. 026.029 Y: (Pharaoh) said: 'If thou dost put forward any god other than me, I will certainly put thee in prison!' P: (Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners. S: Said he: If you will take a god besides me, I will most certainly make you one of the imprisoned. 026.030 Y: (Moses) said: 'Even if I showed you something clear (and) convincing?' P: He said: Even though I show thee something plain? S: He said: What! even if I bring to you something manifest? 026.031 Y: (Pharaoh) said: 'Show it then, if thou tellest the truth!' P: (Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! S: Said he: Bring it then, if you are of the truthful ones. 026.032 Y: So (Moses) threw his rod, and behold, it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)! P: Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, S: So he cast down his rod, and lo! it was an obvious serpent, 026.033 Y: And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders! P: And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. S: And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it appeared white to the onlookers. 026.034 Y: (Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs around him: 'This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed:' P: (Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard, S: (Firon) said to the chiefs around him: Most surely this is a skillful magician, 026.035 Y: 'His plan is to get you out of your land by his sorcery; then what is it ye counsel?' P: Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye? S: Who desires to turn you out of your land with his magic; what is it then that you advise? 026.036 Y: They said: 'Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while), and dispatch to the Cities heralds to collect-' P: They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities summoners, S: They said: Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities; 026.037 Y: 'And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed.' P: Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. S: That they should bring to you every skillful magician. 026.038 Y: So the sorcerers were got together for the appointment of a day well-known, P: So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. S: So the magicians were gathered together at the appointed time on the fixed day, 026.039 Y: And the people were told: 'Are ye (now) assembled?' P: And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering? S: And it was said to the people: Will you gather together? 026.040 Y: 'That we may follow the sorcerers (in religion) if they win?' P: (They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. S: Haply we may follow the magicians, if they are the vanquishers. 026.041 Y: So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh: 'Of course - shall we have a (suitable) reward if we win?' P: And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners? S: And when the magicians came, they said to Firon: Shall we get a reward if we are the vanquishers? 026.042 Y: He said: 'Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person).' P: He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). S: He said: Yes, and surely you will then be of those who are made near. 026.043 Y: Moses said to them: 'Throw ye - that which ye are about to throw!' P: Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! S: Musa said to them: Cast what you are going to cast. 026.044 Y: So they threw their ropes and their rods, and said: 'By the might of Pharaoh, it is we who will certainly win!' P: Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's might, lo! we verily are the winners. S: So they cast down their cords and their rods and said: By Firon's power, we shall most surely be victorious. 026.045 Y: Then Moses threw his rod, when, behold, it straightway swallows up all the falsehoods which they fake! P: Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show. S: Then Musa cast down his staff and lo! it swallowed up the lies they told. 026.046 Y: Then did the sorcerers fall down, prostrate in adoration, P: And the wizards were flung prostrate, S: And the magicians were thrown down prostrate; 026.047 Y: Saying: 'We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,' P: Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, S: They said: We believe in the Lord of the worlds: 026.048 Y: 'The Lord of Moses and Aaron.' P: The Lord of Moses and Aaron. S: The Lord of Musa and Haroun. 026.049 Y: Said (Pharaoh): 'Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? surely he is your leader, who has taught you sorcery! but soon shall ye know!' - 'Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross!' P: (Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every one. S: Said he: You believe in him before I give you permission; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you the magic, so you shall know: certainly I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and certainly I will crucify you all. 026.050 Y: They said: 'No matter! for us, we shall but return to our Lord!' P: They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. S: They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we go back; 026.051 Y: 'Only, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults, that we may become foremost among the believers!' P: Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers. S: Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of the believers. 026.052 Y: By inspiration we told Moses: 'Travel by night with my servants; for surely ye shall be pursued.' P: And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued. S: And We revealed to Musa, saying: Go away with My servants travelling by night, surely you will be pursued. 026.053 Y: Then Pharaoh sent heralds to (all) the Cities, P: Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, S: So Firon sent heralds into the cities; 026.054 Y: (Saying): 'These (Israelites) are but a small band,' P: (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, S: Most surely these are a small company; 026.055 Y: 'And they are raging furiously against us;' P: And lo! they are offenders against us. S: And most surely they have enraged us; 026.056 Y: 'But we are a multitude amply fore-warned.' P: And lo! we are a ready host. S: And most surely we are a vigilant multitude. 026.057 Y: So We expelled them from gardens, springs, P: Thus did We take them away from gardens and water""Then they turned to themselves and said: Surely you yourselves are the unjust. They were confounded with shame: (they said), 'Thou knowest full well that these (idols) do not speak!' And they were utterly confounded, and they said: Well thou knowest that these speak not. Then they were made to hang down their heads: Certainly you know that they do not speak. (Abraham) said, 'Do ye then worship, besides God, things that can neither be of any good to you nor do you harm?' He said: Worship ye then instead of God that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you? He said: What! do you then serve besides God what brings you not any benefit at all, nor does it harm you? 'Fie upon you, and upon the things that ye worship besides God! Have ye no sense?' Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of God! Have ye then no sense? Fie on you and on what you serve besides God; what! do you not then understand? They said, 'Burn him and protect your gods, if ye do (anything at all)!' They cried: Burn him and stand by your gods, if ye will be doing. They said: Burn him and help your gods, if you are going to do (anything). We said, 'O Fire! be thou cool, and (a means of) safety for Abraham!' We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham. We said: O fire! be a comfort and peace to Ibrahim. Then they sought a stratagem against him: but We made them the ones that lost most! And they wished to set a snare for him, but We made them the greater losers. And they desired a war on him, but We made them the greatest losers. But We delivered him and (his nephew) Lut (and directed them) to the land which We have blessed for the nations. And We rescued him and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We have blessed for (all) peoples. And We delivered him as well as Lut (removing them) to the land which We had blessed for all people. And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them). And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and Jacob as a grandson. Each of them We made righteous. And We gave him Ishaq and Yaqoub, a son's son, and We made (them) all good. And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practise regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only). And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command, and We inspired in them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of alms, and they were worshippers of Us (alone). And We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the alms, and Us (alone) did they serve. And to Lut, too, We gave Judgment and Knowledge, and We saved him from the town which practised abominations: truly they were a people given to Evil, a rebellious people. And unto Lot we gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from the community that did abominations. Lo! they were folk of evil, lewd. And (as for) Lut, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town which wrought abominations; surely they were an evil people, transgressors. And We admitted him to Our Mercy: for he was one of the Righteous. And We brought him in unto Our mercy. Lo! he was of the righteous. And We took him into Our mercy; surely he was of the good. (Remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime: We listened to his (prayer) and delivered him and his family from great distress. And Noah, when he cried of old, We heard his prayer and saved him and his household from the great affliction. And Nuh, when he cried aforetime, so We answered him, and delivered him and his followers from the great calamity. We helped him against people who rejected Our Signs: truly they were a people given to Evil: so We drowned them (in the Flood) all together. And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations. Lo! they were folk of evil, therefore did We drown them all. And We helped him against the people who rejected Our communications; surely they were an evil people, so We drowned them all. And remember David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the matter of the field into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night: We did witness their judgment. And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when people's sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night; and We were witnesses to their judgment. And Dawood and Sulaiman when they gave judgment concerning the field when the people's sheep pastured therein by night, and We were bearers of witness to their judgment. To Solomon We inspired the (right) understanding of the matter: to each (of them) We gave Judgment and Knowledge; it was Our power that made the hills and the birds celebrate Our praises, with David: it was We Who did (all these things). And We made Solomon to understand (the case); and unto each of them We gave judgment and knowledge. And we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn (His) praise along with David. We were the doers (thereof). So We made Sulaiman to understand it; and to each one We gave wisdom and knowledge; and We made the mountains, and the birds to celebrate Our praise with Dawood; and We were the doers. It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit, to guard you from each other's violence: will ye then be grateful? And We taught him the art of making garments (of mail) to protect you in your daring. Are ye then thankful? And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, that they might protect you in your wars; will you then be grateful? (It was Our power that made) the violent (unruly) wind flow (tamely) for Solomon, to his order, to the land which We had blessed: for We do know all things. And unto Solomon (We subdued) the wind in its raging. It set by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And of everything We are Aware. And (We made subservient) to Sulaiman the wind blowing violent, pursuing its course by his command to the land which We had blessed, and We are knower of all things. And of the evil ones, were some who dived for him, and did other work besides; and it was We Who guarded them. And of the evil ones (subdued We unto him) some who dived (for pearls) for him and did other work, and We were warders unto them. And of the rebellious people there were those who dived for him and did other work besides that, and We kept guard over them. And (remember) Job, when He cried to his Lord, 'Truly distress has seized me, but Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful.' And Job, when he cried unto his Lord, (saying): Lo! adversity afflicteth me, and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy. And Ayub, when he cried to his Lord, (saying): Harm has afflicted me, and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful. So We listened to him: We removed the distress that was on him, and We restored his people to him, and doubled their number,- as a Grace from Ourselves, and a thing for commemoration, for all who serve Us. Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he suffered, and We gave him his household (that he had lost) and the like thereof along with them, a mercy from Our store, and a remembrance for the worshippers. Therefore We responded to him and took off what harm he had, and We gave him his family and the like of them with them: a mercy from Us and a reminder to the worshippers. And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Zul-kifl, all (men) of constancy and patience. And (mention) Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhu'l-Kifl. All were of the steadfast. And Ismail and Idris and Zulkifl; all were of the patient ones. We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones. And We brought them in unto Our mercy. Lo! they are among the righteous. And We caused them to enter into Our mercy, surely they were of the good ones. And remember Zun-nun, when he departed in wrath: He imagined that We had no power over him! But he cried through the depths of darkness, 'There is no god but Thou: glory to Thee: I was indeed wrong!' And (mention) Dhu'n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no God save Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer. And Yunus, when he went away in wrath, so he thought that We would not straiten him, so he called out among afflictions: There is no god but Thou, glory be to Thee; surely I am of those who make themselves to suffer loss. So We listened to him: and delivered him from distress: and thus do We deliver those who have faith. Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save believers. So We responded to him and delivered him from the grief and thus do We deliver the believers. And (remember) Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: 'O my Lord! leave me not without offspring, though thou art the best of inheritors.' And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors. And Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: O my Lord leave me not alone; and Thou art the best of inheritors. So We listened to him: and We granted him Yahya: We cured his wife's (Barrenness) for him. These (three) were ever quick in emulation in good works; they used to call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves before Us. Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds, and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us. So We responded to him and gave him Yahya and made his wife fit for him; surely they used to hasten, one with another, in deeds of goodness and to call upon Us, hoping and fearing; and they were humble before Us. And (remember) her who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Our spirit, and We made her and her son a sign for all peoples. And she who was chaste, therefore We breathed into her (something) of Our Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples. And she who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her of Our inspiration and made her and her son a sign for the nations. Verily, this brotherhood of yours is a single brotherhood, and I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore serve Me (and no other).""worship Me. Surely this Islam is your religion, one religion (only), and I am your Lord, therefore serve Me. But (later generations) cut off their affair (of unity), one from another: (yet) will they all return to Us. And they have broken their religion (into fragments) among them, (yet) all are returning unto Us. And they broke their religion (into sects) between them: to Us shall all come back. Whoever works any act of righteousness and has faith,- his endeavour will not be rejected: We shall record it in his favour. Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no rejection of his effort. Lo! We record (it) for him. Therefore whoever shall do of good deeds and he is a believer, there shall be no denying of his exertion, and surely We will write (It) down for him. But there is a ban on any population which We have destroyed: that they shall not return, And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they shall not return. And it is binding on a town which We destroy that they shall not return. Until the Gog and Magog (people) are let through (their barrier), and they swiftly swarm from every hill. Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they hasten out of every mound, Even when Gog and Magog are let loose and they shall break forth from every elevated place. Then will the true promise draw nigh (of fulfilment): then behold! the eyes of the Unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror: 'Ah! Woe to us! we were indeed heedless of this; nay, we truly did wrong!' And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers! And the true promise shall draw nigh, then lo! the eyes of those who disbelieved shall be fixedly open: O woe to us! surely we were in a state of heedlessness as to this; nay, we were unjust. Verily ye, (unbelievers), and the (false) gods that ye worship besides God, are (but) fuel for Hell! to it will ye (surely) come! Lo! ye (idolaters) and that which ye worship beside God are fuel of hell. Thereunto ye will come. Surely you and what you worship besides God are the firewood of hell; to it you shall come. If these had been gods, they would not have got there! but each one will abide therein. If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide therein. Had these been gods, they would not have come to it and all shall abide therein. There, sobbing will be their lot, nor will they there hear (aught else). Therein wailing is their portion, and therein they hear not. For them therein shall be groaning and therein they shall not hear. Those for whom the good (record) from Us has gone before, will be removed far therefrom. Lo! those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us, they will be far removed from thence. Surely (as for) those for whom the good has already gone forth from Us, they shall be kept far off from it; Not the slightest sound will they hear of Hell: what their souls desired, in that will they dwell. They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which their souls desire. They will not hear its faintest sound, and they shall abide in that which their souls long for. The Great Terror will bring them no grief: but the angels will meet them (with mutual greetings): 'This is your Day,- (the Day) that ye were promised.' The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels will welcome them, (saying): This is your Day which ye were promised; The great fearful event shall not grieve them, and the angels shall meet them: This is your day which you were promised. The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books (completed),- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it. The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise (binding) upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it. On the day when We will roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We originated the first creation, (so) We shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about. Before this We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message (given to Moses): 'My servants the righteous, shall inherit the earth.' And verily we have written in the Scripture, after the Reminder: My righteous slaves will inherit the earth: And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that (as for) the land, My righteous servants shall inherit it. Verily in this (Qur'an) is a Message for people who would (truly) worship God. Lo! there is a plain statement for folk who are devout. Most surely in this is a message to a people who serve. We sent thee not, but as a Mercy for all creatures. We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples. And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds. Say: 'What has come to me by inspiration is that your God is One God: will ye therefore bow to His Will (in Islam)?' Say: It is only inspired in me that your God is One God. Will ye then surrender (unto Him)? Say: It is only revealed to me that your God is one God; will you then submit? But if they turn back, say: 'I have proclaimed the Message to you all alike and in truth; but I know not whether that which ye are promised is near or far.' But if they are averse, then say: I have warned you all alike, although I know not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised. But if they turn back, say: I have given you warning in fairness and I do not know whether what you are threatened with is near or far: 'It is He Who knows what is open in speech and what ye hide (in your hearts).' Lo! He knoweth that which is said openly, and that which ye conceal. Surely He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you hide: 'I know not but that it may be a trial for you, and a grant of (worldly) livelihood (to you) for a time.' And I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and enjoyment for a while. And I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision till a time. Say: 'O my Lord! judge Thou in truth!' 'Our Lord Most Gracious is the One Whose assistance should be sought against the blasphemies ye utter!' He saith: My Lord! Judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Beneficent, Whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe (unto Him). He said: O my Lord! judge Thou with truth; and our Lord is the Beneficent God, Whose help is sought against what you ascribe (to Him)."springs, 026.058 Y: Treasures, and every kind of honorable position; P: And treasures and a fair estate. 026.059 Y: Thus it was, but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things.

P: He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. 026.063 Y: Then We told Moses by inspiration: "Strike the sea with thy rod." So it divided, and each separate part became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain. P: Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast. 026.064 Y: And We made the other party approach thither. P: Then brought We near the others to that place. 026.065 Y: We delivered Moses and all who were with him; P: And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; 026.066 Y: But We drowned the others. P: And We drowned the others. 026.067 Y: Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 026.068 Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. P: And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 026.069 Y: And rehearse to them (something of) Abraham's story. P: Recite unto them the story of Abraham: 026.070 Y: Behold, he said to his father and his people: "What worship ye?" P: When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye? 026.071 Y: They said: "We worship idols, and we remain constantly in attendance on them." P: They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. 026.072 Y: He said: "Do they listen to you when ye call (on them)," P: He said: Do they hear you when ye cry? 026.073 Y: "Or do you good or harm?" P: Or do they benefit or harm you? 026.074 Y: They said: "Nay, but we found our fathers doing thus (what we do)." P: They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. 026.075 Y: He said: "Do ye then see whom ye have been worshipping,"- P: He said: See now that which ye worship, 026.076 Y: "Ye and your fathers before you?"- P: Ye and your forefathers! 026.077 Y: "For they are enemies to me; not so the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds;" P: Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, 026.078 Y: "Who created me, and it is He Who guides me;" P: Who created me, and He doth guide me, 026.079 Y: "Who gives me food and drink," P: And Who feedeth me and watereth me. 026.080 Y: "And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me;" P: And when I sicken, then He healeth me, 026.081 Y: "Who will cause me to die, and then to life (again);" P: And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), 026.082 Y: "And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Judgment." P: And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. 026.083 Y: "O my Lord! bestow wisdom on me, and join me with the righteous;" P: My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. 026.084 Y: "Grant me honorable mention on the tongue of truth among the latest (generations);" P: And give unto me a good report in later generations. 026.085 Y: "Make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss;" P: And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, 026.086 Y: "Forgive my father, for that he is among those astray;" P: And forgive my father.

Can they help you or help themselves?" P: Instead of God? Can they help you or help themselves? 026.094 Y: "Then they will be thrown headlong into the (Fire),- they and those straying in Evil," P: Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers 026.095 Y: "And the whole hosts of Iblis together." P: And the hosts of Iblis, together. 026.096 Y: "They will say there in their mutual bickerings:" P: And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: 026.097 Y: "'By God, we were truly in an error manifest," P: By God, of a truth we were in error manifest 026.098 Y: "When we held you as equals with the Lord of the Worlds;" P: When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. 026.099 Y: "And our seducers were only those who were steeped in guilt."

He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 026.105 Y: The people of Noah rejected the messengers. P: Noah's folk denied the messengers (of God), 026.106 Y: Behold, their brother Noah said to them: "Will ye not fear (God)?" P: When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil)? 026.107 Y: "I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust:" P: Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 026.108 Y: "So fear God, and obey me." P: So keep your duty to God, and obey me. 026.109 Y: "No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds:" P: And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. 026.110 Y: "So fear God, and obey me." P: So keep your duty to God, and obey me. 026.111 Y: They said: "Shall we believe in thee when it is the meanest that follow thee?" P: They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow thee? 026.112 Y: He said: "And what do I know as to what they do?" P: He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in the past)? 026.113 Y: "Their account is only with my Lord, if ye could (but) understand." P: Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; 026.114 Y: "I am not one to drive away those who believe." P: And I am not (here) to repulse believers. 026.115 Y: "I am sent only to warn plainly in public." P: I am only a plain warner. 026.116 Y: They said: "If thou desist not, O Noah! thou shalt be stoned (to death)." P: They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned (to death).after having knowledge he does not know anything; and you see the earth sterile land, but when We send down on it the water, it stirs and swells and brings forth of every kind a beautiful herbage. This is so, because God is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who has power over all things. And verily the Hour will come: there can be no doubt about it, or about the fact that God will raise up all who are in the graves. Yet there is among men such a one as disputes about God, without knowledge, without guidance, and without a Book of Enlightenment. (Disdainfully) bending his side, in order to lead men astray from the Path of God: for him there is disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Judgment We shall make him taste the Penalty of burning Fire. (It will be said): "This is because of the deeds which thy hands sent forth, for verily God is not unjust to His servants." There are among men some who serve God, as it were, on the verge: if good befalls them, they are, therewith, well content; but if a trial comes to them, they turn on their faces: they lose both this world and the Hereafter: that is loss for all to see! They call on such deities, besides God, as can neither hurt nor profit them: that is straying far indeed from the Way! (Perhaps) they call on one whose hurt is nearer than his profit: evil, indeed, is the patron, and evil the companion or help! Verily God will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens, beneath which rivers flow: for God carries out all that He plans. If any think that God will not help him (His Messenger) in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the ceiling and cut himself off: then let him see whether his plan will remove that which enrages him! Thus have We sent down Clear Signs; and verily God doth guide whom He will! Those who believe in the Qur'an, those who follow the Jewish scriptures, and the Sabians, Christians, Magians, and Polytheists,- God will judge between them on the Day of Judgment: for God is witness of all things. Seest thou not that to God bow down in worship all things that are in the heavens and on earth,- the sun, the moon, the stars; the hills, the trees, the animals; and a great number among mankind? But a great number are also such as are fit for Punishment: and such as God shall disgrace,- None can raise to honour: for God carries out all that He wills. These two antagonists dispute with each other about their Lord: But those who deny their Lord,- for them will be cut out a garment of Fire: over their heads will be poured out boiling water. With it will be scalded what is within their bodies, as well as their skins. In addition there will be maces of iron to punish them. Every time they wish to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be forced back therein, and it will be said, "Taste ye the Penalty of Burning!" God will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow: they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk. For they have been guided in this life to the purest of speeches; they have been guided to the Path of Him Who is Worthy of all Praise. As to those who have rejected God, and would keep back men from the Way of God, and from the Sacred Mosque, which We have made open to all men - equal is the dweller there and the visitor from the country - and any whose purpose therein is profanity or wrong-doing - them will We cause to taste of a most Grievous Penalty. Behold! We gave the site, to Abraham, of the Sacred House, saying: "Associate not anything in worship with Me; and sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or stand up, or bow, or prostrate themselves therein in prayer.""And We assigned to Ibrahim the place of the House, saying: Do not associate with Me aught, and purify My House for those who make the circuit and stand to pray and bow and prostrate themselves. And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men: they will come to thee on foot and on every kind of camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways. That they may witness the benefits provided for them, and celebrate the name of God, through the Days appointed, over the cattle which He has provided for them for sacrifice: then eat thereof and feed the distressed ones in want. Then let them complete the rites prescribed for them, perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House. Such is the Pilgrimage: whoever honors the sacred rites of God, for him it is good in the Sight of his Lord. Lawful to you for food in Pilgrimage are cattle, except those mentioned to you as exceptions: but shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word that is false. Being true in faith to God, and never assigning partners to Him: if anyone assigns partners to God, it is as if he had fallen from heaven and been snatched up by birds, or the wind had swooped and thrown him into a far-distant place. Such is his state: and whoever holds in honor the symbols of God, in the sacrifice of animals, such honor should come truly from piety of heart. In them ye have benefits for a term appointed: in the end their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House. To every people did We appoint rites of sacrifice, that they might celebrate the name of God over the sustenance He gave them from animals fit for food. But your God is One God: submit then your wills to Him in Islam: and give the good news to those who humble themselves. To those whose hearts, when God is mentioned, are filled with fear, who show patient perseverance over their afflictions, keep up regular prayer, and spend in charity out of what We have bestowed upon them. The sacrificial camels We have made for you as among the symbols from God: in them is much good for you: then pronounce the name of God over them as they line up for sacrifice: when they are down on their sides after slaughter, eat thereof and feed such as live in contentment, and such as beg with due humility: thus have We made animals subject to you, that ye may be grateful. It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches God: it is your piety that reaches Him: He has thus made them subject to you, that ye may glorify God for His Guidance to you and proclaim the good news to all who do right. Verily God will defend from ill those who believe: verily, God loves not any that is a traitor to faith, or shows ingratitude. To those against whom war is made, permission is given to fight, because they are wronged; and verily, God is most powerful for their aid. They are those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right, for no cause except that they say, 'Our Lord is God.' Did not God check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of God is commemorated in abundant measure. God will certainly aid those who aid His cause; for verily God is full of Strength, Exalted in Might, able to enforce His Will. They are those who, if We establish them in the land, establish regular prayer and give regular charity, enjoin the right and forbid wrong: with God rests the end and decision of all affairs. If they treat thy mission as false, so did the peoples before them with their prophets, the People of Noah, and 'Ad and Thamud. Those of Abraham and Lut. And the Companions of the Madyan People; and Moses was rejected in the same way. But I granted respite to the Unbelievers, and only after that did I punish them: but how terrible was My rejection of them! How many populations have We destroyed, which were given to wrong-doing? They tumbled down on their roof."He said: "O my Lord! truly my people have rejected me." P: He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. S: He said: My Lord! Surely my people give me the lie! Y: "Judge Thou, then, between me and them openly, and deliver me and those of the Believers who are with me." P: Therefore judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me. S: Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just) judgment, and deliver me and those who are with me of the believers. Y: So We delivered him and those with him, in the Ark filled (with all creatures). P: And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. S: So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark. Y: Thereafter We drowned those who remained behind. P: Then afterward We drowned the others. S: Then We drowned the rest afterwards. Y: Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. S: Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe. Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. P: And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. S: And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. Y: The 'Ad (people) rejected the messengers. P: (The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of God). S: Ad gave the lie to the messengers. Y: Behold, their brother Hud said to them: "Will ye not fear (God)?" P: When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil)? S: When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)? Y: "I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust:" P: Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, S: Surely I am a faithful messenger to you; Y: "So fear God and obey me." P: So keep your duty to God and obey me. S: Therefore guard against (the punishment of) God and obey me: Y: "No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds." P: And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. S: And I do not ask you any reward for it; surely my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds; Y: "Do ye build a landmark on every high place to amuse yourselves?" P: Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight? S: Do you build on every height a monument? Vain is it that you do: Y: "And do ye get for yourselves fine buildings in the hope of living therein (for ever)?" P: And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever? S: And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may. Y: "And when ye exert your strong hand, do ye do it like men of absolute power?" P: And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants? S: And when you lay hands (on men) you lay hands (like) tyrants; Y: "Now fear God, and obey me." P: Rather keep your duty to God, and obey me. S: So guard against (the punishment of) God and obey me. Y: "Yea, fear Him Who has bestowed on you freely all that ye know." P: Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that ye know, S: And be careful of (your duty to) Him Who has given you abundance of what you know. Y: "Freely has He bestowed on you cattle and sons,"- P: Hath aided you with cattle and sons. S: He has given you abundance of cattle and children. Y: "And Gardens and Springs." P: And gardens and watersprings. S: And gardens and fountains; Y: "Truly I fear for you the Penalty of a Great Day." P: Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day. S: Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day. Y: They said: "It is the same to us whether thou admonish us or be not among (our) admonishers!" P: They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach; S: They said: It is the same to us whether you admonish or are not one of the admonishers; Y: "This is no other than a customary device of the ancients," P: This is but a fable of the men of old, S: This is naught but a custom of the ancients; Y: "And we are not the ones to receive Pains and Penalties!" P: And we shall not be doomed. S: And we are not going to be punished. Y: So they rejected him, and We destroyed them. Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: And they denied him; therefore We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. S: So they gave him the lie, then We destroyed them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe. Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. P: And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. S: And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. Y: The Thamud (people) rejected the messengers. P: (The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of God). S: Samood gave the lie to the messengers. Y: Behold, their brother Salih said to them: "Will you not fear (God)?" P: When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil)? S: When their brother Salih said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)? Y: "I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust." P: Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, S: Surely I am a faithful messenger to you. Y: "So fear God, and obey me." P: So keep your duty to God and obey me. S: Therefore guard against (the punishment of) God and obey me: Y: "No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds." P: And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. S: And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds: Y: "Will ye be left secure, in (the enjoyment of) all that ye have here?"- P: Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us, S: Will you be left secure in what is here; Y: "Gardens and Springs," P: In gardens and watersprings. S: In gardens and fountains, Y: "And corn-fields and date-palms with spathes near breaking (with the weight of fruit)?" P: And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees, S: And cornfields and palm-trees having fine spadices? Y: "And ye carve houses out of (rocky) mountains with great skill." P: Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful? S: And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly; Y: "But fear God and obey me;" P: Therefore keep your duty to God and obey me, S: Therefore guard against (the punishment of) God and obey me; Y: "And follow not the bidding of those who are extravagant,"- P: And obey not the command of the prodigal, S: And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant, Y: "Who make mischief in the land, and mend not (their ways)." P: Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not. S: Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright. Y: They said: "Thou art only one of those bewitched!" P: They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; S: They said: You are only of the deluded ones; Y: "Thou art no more than a mortal like us: then bring us a Sign, if thou tellest the truth!" P: Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful. S: You are naught but a mortal like ourselves; so bring a sign if you are one of the truthful. Y: He said: "Here is a she-camel: she has a right of watering, and ye have a right of watering, (severally) on a day appointed." P: He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well), and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day. S: He said: This is a she-camel; she shall have her portion of water, and you have your portion of water on an appointed time; Y: "Touch her not with harm, lest the Penalty of a Great Day seize you." P: And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day. S: And do not touch her with evil, lest the punishment of a grievous day should overtake you. Y: But they ham-strung her: then did they become full of regrets. P: But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent. S: But they hamstrung her, then regretted; Y: But the Penalty seized them. Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. S: So the punishment overtook them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe. Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. P: And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. S: And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. Y: The people of Lut rejected the messengers.

How many a township have We destroyed while it was sinful, so that it lies in ruins, and a deserted well and lofty tower! Do they not travel through the land, so that their hearts may learn wisdom and their ears may learn to hear? Truly it is not their eyes that are blind, but their hearts which are in their breasts. Yet they ask thee to hasten on the Punishment! But God will not fail in His Promise. Verily a Day in the sight of thy Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning. And to how many populations did I give respite, which were given to wrong-doing? In the end, I punished them. To Me is the destination of all. Say: "O men! I am sent to you only to give a Clear Warning." Those who believe and work righteousness, for them is forgiveness and a sustenance most generous. But those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them, they will be Companions of the Fire. Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before thee, but when he framed a desire, Satan threw some vanity into his desire: but God will cancel anything vain that Satan throws in, and God will confirm His Signs: for God is full of Knowledge and Wisdom. That He may make the suggestions thrown in by Satan a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and who are hardened of heart: verily the wrong-doers are in a schism far from the Truth. And that those on whom knowledge has been bestowed may learn that the Qur'an is the Truth from thy Lord, and that they may believe therein, and their hearts may be made humbly open to it: for verily God is the Guide of those who believe, to the Straight Way. Those who reject Faith will not cease to be in doubt concerning Revelation until the Hour of Judgment comes suddenly upon them, or there comes to them the Penalty of a Day of Disaster. On that Day, Dominion will be that of God: He will judge between them: so those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight. And for those who reject Faith and deny our Signs, there will be a humiliating Punishment. Those who leave their homes in the cause of God, and are then slain or die, on them will God bestow verily a goodly Provision: Truly God is He Who bestows the best provision. Verily He will admit them to a place with which they shall be well pleased: for God is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. And if one has retaliated to no greater extent than the injury he received, and is again set upon inordinately, God will help him: for God is One that blots out sins and forgives again and again. That is because God merges night into day, and He merges day into night, and verily it is God Who hears and sees all things. That is because God is the Reality; and those besides Him whom they invoke, they are but vain Falsehood: verily God is He, Most High, Most Great. Seest thou not that God sends down rain from the sky, and forthwith the earth becomes clothed with green? For God is He Who understands the finest mysteries, and is well-acquainted with them. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: for verily God, He is free of all wants, Worthy of all Praise. Seest thou not that God has made subject to you all that is on the earth, and the ships that sail through the sea by His Command? He withholds the sky from falling on the earth except by His leave: for God is Most Kind and Most Merciful to man. It is He Who gave you life, will cause you to die, and will again give you life: Truly man is a most ungrateful creature! To every People have We appointed rites and ceremonies which they must follow: let them not then dispute with thee on the matter, but do thou invite them to thy Lord: for thou art assuredly on the Right Way.To every nation We appointed acts of devotion which they observe, therefore they should not dispute with you about the matter and call to your Lord; most surely you are on a right way. If they do wrangle with thee, say, "God knows best what it is ye are doing." God will judge between you on the Day of Judgment concerning the matters in which ye differ. Knowest thou not that God knows all that is in heaven and on earth? Indeed it is all in a Record, and that is easy for God. Yet they worship, besides God, things for which no authority has been sent down to them, and of which they have no knowledge: for those that do wrong there is no helper. When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, thou wilt notice a denial on the faces of the Unbelievers! They nearly attack with violence those who rehearse Our Signs to them. Say, "Shall I tell you of something far worse than these Signs? It is the Fire of Hell! God has promised it to the Unbelievers! And evil is that destination!" O men! Here is a parable set forth! Listen to it! Those on whom, besides God, ye call, cannot create even a fly, if they all met together for the purpose! And if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition and those whom they petition! No just estimate have they made of God: for God is He Who is strong and able to carry out His Will. God chooses messengers from angels and from men for God is He Who hears and sees all things. He knows what is before them and what is behind them: and to God go back all questions for decision. O ye who believe! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, and adore your Lord; and do good; that ye may prosper. And strive in His cause as ye ought to strive, with sincerity and under discipline. He has chosen you, and has imposed no difficulties on you in religion; it is the cult of your father Abraham. It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before and in this Revelation; that the Messenger may be a witness for you, and ye be witnesses for mankind! So establish regular Prayer, give regular Charity, and hold fast to God! He is your Protector - the Best to protect and the Best to help!for food. And a tree that grows out of Mount Sinai which produces oil and a condiment for those who eat. And in cattle, you have an instructive example: from within their bodies We produce milk for you to drink; there are numerous other benefits for you, and of their meat you eat. And on them and on the ships you are carried. We sent Noah to his people: He said, "O my people! Worship God! You have no other god but Him. Will you not fear Him?" The chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said, "He is no more than a man like yourselves: his wish is to assert his superiority over you: if God had wished to send messengers, He could have sent down angels; never did we hear such a thing among our ancestors of old." Some said, "He is only a man possessed: wait with him for a time." Noah said, "O my Lord! Help me, for they accuse me of falsehood!" So We inspired him: "Construct the Ark within Our sight and under Our guidance: then when Our Command comes, and the fountains of the earth gush forth, take on board pairs of every species, male and female, and your family—except those against whom the Word has already gone forth: And do not address Me in favor of the wrong-doers; for they shall be drowned." And when you have embarked on the Ark, say: "Praise be to God, Who has saved us from the people who do wrong." And say: "O my Lord! Enable me to disembark with Your blessing: for You are the Best to enable us to disembark." Verily in this there are Signs for men to understand; thus do We try men. Then We raised after them another generation. And We sent to them a messenger from among themselves, saying, "Worship God! You have no other god but Him. Will you not fear Him?" The chiefs of his people, who disbelieved and denied the Meeting in the Hereafter, and on whom We had bestowed the good things of this life, said, "He is no more than a man like yourselves: he eats of what you eat, and drinks of what you drink. If you obey a man like yourselves, you will surely be lost. Does he promise that when you die and become dust and bones, you shall be brought forth again? Far, very far is that which you are promised! There is nothing but our life in this world! We die and we live! But we shall never be raised up again! He is only a man who invents a lie against God, but we are not the ones to believe in him!" The prophet said, "O my Lord! Help me, for they accuse me of falsehood." God said, "In but a little while, they are sure to be sorry!" Then the Blast overtook them with justice, and We made them as rubbish of dead leaves floating on the stream of Time! So away with the people who do wrong! Then We raised after them other generations. No people can hasten their term, nor can they delay it. Then We sent Our messengers in succession: every time there came to a people their messenger, they accused him of falsehood: so We made them follow each other in punishment: We made them as a tale that is told: So away with a people that will not believe! Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our Signs and authority manifest, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: But these behaved insolently: they were an arrogant people. They said, "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves? And their people are subject to us!" So they accused them of falsehood, and they became of those who were destroyed. And We gave Moses the Book, in order that they might receive guidance. And We made the son of Mary and his mother as a Sign: We gave them both shelter on high ground, affording rest and security and furnished with springs.f Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them refuge on a height, a place of flocks and watersprings. O messengers! Enjoy good and pure things, and work righteousness: for I am well-acquainted with all that you do. This Brotherhood of yours is a single Brotherhood, and I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore fear Me. But people have cut off their unity into sects: each party rejoices in what it has. Leave them in their confused ignorance for a time. Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and sons, We would hasten them on in every good? Nay, they do not understand. Verily those who live in awe for fear of their Lord; those who believe in the Signs of their Lord; those who join not partners with their Lord; and those who dispense their charity with their hearts full of fear, because they will return to their Lord; it is these who hasten in every good work, and these who are foremost in them. On no soul do We place a burden greater than it can bear: before Us is a record which clearly shows the truth: they will never be wronged. But their hearts are in confused ignorance of this; and there are, besides that, deeds of theirs, which they will continue to do. Until, when We seize in Punishment those of them who received the good things of this world, behold, they will groan in supplication! It will be said: "Groan not in supplication this day: for you shall certainly not be helped by Us." My Signs used to be rehearsed to you, but you used to turn back on your heels in arrogance: talking nonsense about the Qur'an, like one telling fables by night. Do they not ponder over the Word of God, or has anything new come to them that did not come to their fathers of old? Or do they not recognize their Messenger, that they deny him? Or do they say, "He is possessed"? Nay, he has brought them the Truth, but most of them hate the Truth. If the Truth had been in accord with their desires, truly the heavens and the earth, and all beings therein would have been in confusion and corruption! Nay, We have sent them their admonition, but they turn away from their admonition. Or is it that you ask them for some recompense? But the recompense of your Lord is best: He is the Best of those who give sustenance. But verily you call them to the Straight Way; and verily those who believe not in the Hereafter are deviating from that Way. If We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering in distraction to and fro. We inflicted Punishment on them, but they humbled not themselves to their Lord, nor do they submissively entreat Him! Until We open on them a gate leading to a severe Punishment: then they will be plunged in despair therein! It is He Who has created for you the faculties of hearing, sight, feeling, and understanding: little thanks it is you give! And He has multiplied you through the earth, and to Him shall you be gathered back. It is He Who gives life and death, and to Him is due the alternation of Night and Day: will you not then understand? On the contrary, they say things similar to what the ancients said. They say: "What! When we die and become dust and bones, could we really be raised up again?" Such things have been promised to us and to our fathers before! They are nothing but tales of the ancients! Say: "To whom belong the earth and all beings therein? If you know!" They will say, "To God!" Say: "Yet will you not receive admonition?" Say: "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the Throne Supreme?""Except an old woman who stayed behind. P: Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. S: Except an old woman, among those who remained behind. 026.172 Y: But the rest We destroyed utterly. P: Then afterward We destroyed the others. S: Then We utterly destroyed the others. 026.173 Y: We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! P: And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned. S: And We rained down upon them a rain, and evil was the rain on those warned. 026.174 Y: Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. S: Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe. 026.175 Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might Most Merciful. P: And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. S: And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. 026.176 Y: The Companions of the Wood rejected the messengers. P: The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of God), S: The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the messengers. 026.177 Y: Behold, Shu'aib said to them: "Will ye not fear (God)?" P: When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil)? S: When Shu'aib said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)? 026.178 Y: "I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust." P: Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, S: Surely I am a faithful messenger to you; 026.179 Y: "So fear God and obey me." P: So keep your duty to God and obey me. S: Therefore guard against (the punishment of) God and obey me: 026.180 Y: "No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds." P: And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. S: And I do not ask you any reward for it, my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds; 026.181 Y: "Give just measure, and cause no loss (to others by fraud)." P: Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due). S: Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish; 026.182 Y: "And weigh with scales true and upright." P: And weigh with the true balance. S: And weigh (things) with a right balance, 026.183 Y: "And withhold not things justly due to men, nor do evil in the land, working mischief." P: Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth. S: And do not wrong men of their things, and do not act corruptly in the earth, making mischief. 026.184 Y: "And fear Him Who created you and (who created) the generations before (you)." P: And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old. S: And guard against (the punishment of) Him who created you and the former nations. 026.185 Y: They said: "Thou art only one of those bewitched!" P: They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; S: They said: You are only of those deluded; 026.186 Y: "Thou art no more than a mortal like us, and indeed we think thou art a liar!" P: Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. S: And you are naught but a mortal like ourselves, and we know you to be certainly of the liars. 026.187 Y: "Now cause a piece of the sky to fall on us, if thou art truthful!" P: Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful. S: Therefore cause a portion of the heaven to come down upon us, if you are one of the truthful. 026.188 Y: He said: "My Lord knows best what ye do." P: He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do. S: He said: My Lord knows best what you do. 026.189 Y: But they rejected him. Then the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them, and that was the Penalty of a Great Day. P: But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day. S: But they called him a liar, so the punishment of the day of covering overtook them; surely it was the punishment of a grievous day. 026.190 Y: Verily in that is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. S: Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe. 026.191 Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. P: And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. S: And most surely your Lord is Mighty, the Merciful. 026.192 Y: Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds: P: And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds, S: And most surely this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. 026.193 Y: With it came down the spirit of Faith and Truth- P: Which the True Spirit hath brought down S: The Faithful Spirit has descended with it, 026.194 Y: To thy heart and mind, that thou mayest admonish. P: Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners, S: Upon your heart that you may be of the warners 026.195 Y: In the perspicuous Arabic tongue. P: In plain Arabic speech. S: In plain Arabic language. 026.196 Y: Without doubt it is (announced) in the mystic Books of former peoples. P: And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old. S: And most surely the same is in the scriptures of the ancients. 026.197 Y: Is it not a Sign to them that the Learned of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)? P: Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it? S: Is it not a sign to them that the learned men of the Israelites know it? 026.198 Y: Had We revealed it to any of the non-Arabs, P: And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, S: And if we had revealed it to any of the foreigners 026.199 Y: And had he recited it to them, they would not have believed in it. P: And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it. S: So that he should have recited it to them, they would not have believed therein. 026.200 Y: Thus have We caused it to enter the hearts of the sinners. P: Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty. S: Thus have We caused it to enter into the hearts of the guilty. 026.201 Y: They will not believe in it until they see the grievous Penalty; P: They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom, S: They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment. 026.202 Y: But the (Penalty) will come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it not; P: So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not. S: And it shall come to them all of a sudden, while they shall not perceive; 026.203 Y: Then they will say: "Shall we be respited?" P: Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved? S: Then they will say: Shall we be respited? 026.204 Y: Do they then ask for Our Penalty to be hastened on? P: Would they (now) hasten on Our doom? S: What! do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment? 026.205 Y: Seest thou? If We do let them enjoy (this life) for a few years, P: Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years, S: Have you then considered if We let them enjoy themselves for years, 026.206 Y: Yet there comes to them at length the (Punishment) which they were promised! P: And then cometh that which they were promised, S: Then there comes to them that with which they are threatened, 026.207 Y: It will profit them not that they enjoyed (this life)! P: (How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them? S: That which they were made to enjoy shall not avail them? 026.208 Y: Never did We destroy a population, but had its warners - P: And We destroyed no township but it had its warners S: And We did not destroy any town but it had (its) warners, 026.209 Y: By way of reminder; and We never are unjust. P: For reminder, for We never were oppressors. S: To remind, and We are never unjust. 026.210 Y: No evil ones have brought down this (Revelation): P: The devils did not bring it down. S: And the Shaitans have not come down with it. 026.211 Y: It would neither suit them nor would they be able (to produce it). P: It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power, S: And it behoves them not, and they have not the power to do (it). 026.212 Y: Indeed they have been removed far from even (a chance of) hearing it. P: Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing. S: Most surely they are far removed from the hearing of it. 026.213 Y: So call not on any other god with God, or thou wilt be among those under the Penalty. P: Therefore invoke not with God another god, lest thou be one of the doomed. S: So call not upon another god with God, lest you be of those who are punished. 026.214 Y: And admonish thy nearest kinsmen, P: And warn thy tribe of near kindred, S: And warn your nearest relations, 026.215 Y: And lower thy wing to the Believers who follow thee. P: And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee. S: And be kind to him who follows you of the believers. 026.216 Y: Then if they disobey thee, say: "I am free (of responsibility) for what ye do!" P: And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they do. S: But if they disobey you, then say: Surely I am clear of what you do. 026.217 Y: And put thy trust on the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,- P: And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful. S: And rely on the Mighty, the Merciful, 026.218 Y: Who seeth thee standing forth (in prayer), P: Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray) S: Who sees you when you stand up. 026.219 Y: And thy movements among those who prostrate themselves, P: And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship). S: And your turning over and over among those who prostrate themselves before God. 026.220 Y: For it is He Who heareth and knoweth all things. P: Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower. S: Surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 026.221 Y: Shall I inform you, (O people!), on whom it is that the evil ones descend? P: Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend? S: Shall I inform you (of him) upon whom the Shaitans descend? 026.222 Y: They descend on every lying, wicked person, P: They descend on every sinful, false one. S: They descend upon every lying, sinful one, 026.223 Y: (Into whose ears) they pour hearsay vanities, and most of them are liars. P: They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars. S: They incline their ears, and most of them are liars. 026.224 Y: And the Poets,- It is those straying in Evil, who follow them: P: As for poets, the erring follow them. S: And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them. 026.225 Y: Seest thou not that they wander distracted in every valley?- P: Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley, S: Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley? 026.226 Y: And that they say what they practise not?- P: And how they say that which they do not? S: And that they say that which they do not do, 026.227 Y: Except those who believe, work righteousness, engage much in the remembrance of God, and defend themselves only after they are unjustly attacked. P: Save those who believe and do good works, and remember God much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. S: Except those who believe and do good and remember God much, and defend themselves after they are oppressed. And they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back."s and the Lord of the mighty dominion? They will say, "(They belong) to God." Say: "Will you not then be filled with awe?" They will say: "Unto God (all that belongs)." Say: "Will you not then keep duty unto Him?" They will say: "(This is) God's." Say: "Will you not then guard against evil?" Say: "Who is it in whose hands is the governance of all things, who protects all, but is not protected by any? (say) if you know." They will say: "(It belongs) to God." Say: "Then how are you deluded?" They will say: "Unto God (all that belongs)." Say: "How then are you bewitched?" We have sent them the Truth: but they indeed practice falsehood! Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars. No son did God beget, nor is there any god along with Him: (if there were many gods), behold, each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have lorded it over others! Glory to God! (He is free) from the (sort of) things they attribute to Him! God has not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be God above all that they allege. Never did God take to Himself a son, and never was there with Him any (other) god; in that case, each god would have certainly taken away what he created, and some of them would certainly have overpowered others; glory be to God above what they describe! He knows what is hidden and what is open: too high is He for the partners they attribute to Him! Knower of the invisible and the visible! and exalted be He over all that they ascribe as partners (unto Him)! Say: "O my Lord! if Thou wilt show me (in my lifetime) that which they are warned against,"- Say: "My Lord! If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised." Say: "O my Lord! if Thou shouldst make me see what they are threatened with: Then, O my Lord! put me not amongst the people who do wrong!" My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk. My Lord! then place me not with the unjust. And We are certainly able to show thee (in fulfillment) that against which they are warned. And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them. And most surely We are well able to make you see what We threaten them with. Repel evil with that which is best: We are well acquainted with the things they say. Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best Aware of that which they allege. Repel evil by what is best; We know best what they describe. And say "O my Lord! I seek refuge with Thee from the suggestions of the Evil Ones." And say: "My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones," And say: "O my Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the evil suggestions of the Shaitans; And I seek refuge with Thee O my Lord! lest they should come near me." And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me, And I seek refuge in Thee! O my Lord! from their presence. (In Falsehood will they be) Until, when death comes to one of them, he says: "O my Lord! send me back (to life)," Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith: My Lord! Send me back, Until when death overtakes one of them, he says: Send me back, my Lord, send me back; "In order that I may work righteousness in the things I neglected." -"By no means! It is but a word he says."- Before them is a Partition till the Day they are raised up. That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a word that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised. Haply I may do good in that which I have left. By no means! it is a (mere) word that he speaks; and before them is a barrier until the day they are raised. Then when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no more relationships between them that day, nor will one ask after another! And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day, nor will they ask of one another. So when the trumpet is blown, there shall be no ties of relationship between them on that day, nor shall they ask of each other. Then those whose balance (of good deeds) is heavy,- they will attain salvation: Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful. Then as for him whose good deeds are preponderant, these are the successful. But those whose balance is light, will be those who have lost their souls, in Hell will they abide. And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell abiding. And as for him whose good deeds are light, these are they who shall have lost their souls, abiding in hell. The Fire will burn their faces, and they will therein grin, with their lips displaced. The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein. The fire shall scorch their faces, and they therein shall be in severe affliction. "Were not My Signs rehearsed to you, and ye did but treat them as falsehood?" (It will be said): Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye used to deny them? Were not My communications recited to you? But you used to reject them. They will say: "Our Lord! Our misfortune overwhelmed us, and we became a people astray!" They will say: Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring folk. They shall say: O our Lord! our adversity overcame us and we were an erring people: "Our Lord! bring us out of this: if ever we return (to Evil), then shall we be wrong-doers indeed!" Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return (to evil) then indeed we shall be wrong-doers. O our Lord! Take us out of it; then if we return (to evil) surely we shall be unjust. He will say: "Be ye driven into it (with ignominy)! And speak ye not to Me!" He saith: Begone therein, and speak not unto Me. He shall say: Go away into it and speak not to Me; "A part of My servants there was, who used to pray 'our Lord! we believe; then do Thou forgive us, and have mercy upon us: For Thou art the Best of those who show mercy!" Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said: Our Lord! We believe, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy; Surely there was a party of My servants who said: O our Lord! we believe, so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones. "But ye treated them with ridicule, so much so that (ridicule of) them made you forget My Message while ye were laughing at them!" But ye chose them for a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them. But you took them for a mockery until they made you forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them. "I have rewarded them this Day for their patience and constancy: they are indeed the ones that have achieved Bliss" Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast; and they surely are the triumphant. Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were patient, that they are the achievers. He will say: "What number of years did ye stay on earth?" He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years? He will say: How many years did you tarry in the earth? They will say: "We stayed a day or part of a day: but ask those who keep account." They will say: We tarried by a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep count! They will say: We tarried a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep account. He will say: "Ye stayed not but a little,- if ye had only known!" He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew. He will say: You did tarry but a little had you but known (it): "Did ye then think that We had created you in jest, and that ye would not be brought back to Us (for account)?" Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not be returned unto Us? What! did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you shall not be returned to Us? Therefore exalted be God, the King, the Reality: there is no god but He, the Lord of the Throne of Honour! Now God be Exalted, the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord of the Throne of Grace. So exalted be God, the True King; no god is there but He, the Lord of the honorable dominion. If anyone invokes, besides God, any other god, he has no authority therefor; and his reckoning will be only with his Lord! and verily the Unbelievers will fail to win through! He who cries unto any other god along with God has no proof thereof. His reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful. And whoever invokes with God another god he has no proof of this his reckoning is only with his Lord; surely the unbelievers shall not be successful. So say: "O my Lord! grant Thou forgiveness and mercy for Thou art the Best of those who show mercy!" And (O Muhammad) say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art best of all who show mercy. And say: O my Lord! forgive and have mercy, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones."justly attacked. And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take! P: Save those who believe and do good works, and remember God much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned! S: Except those who believe and do good and remember God much, and defend themselves after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back. - Chapter 27: AL-NAML (THE ANT, THE ANTS) Total Verses: 93 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 027.001 Y: These are verses of the Qur'an,-a book that makes (things) clear; P: Ta. Sin. These are revelations of the Qur'an and a Scripture that maketh plain; S: Ta Sin! These are the verses of the Quran and the Book that makes (things) clear, 027.002 Y: A guide: and glad tidings for the believers,- P: A guidance and good tidings for believers S: A guidance and good news for the believers, 027.003 Y: Those who establish regular prayers and give in regular charity, and also have (full) assurance of the hereafter. P: Who establish worship and pay the poor-due and are sure of the Hereafter. S: Who keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and of the hereafter, they are sure. 027.004 Y: As to those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds pleasing in their eyes; and so they wander about in distraction. P: Lo! as for those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their works fairseeming unto them so that they are all astray. S: As to those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have surely made their deeds fair-seeming to them, but they blindly wander on. 027.005 Y: Such are they for whom a grievous Penalty is (waiting); and in the Hereafter theirs will be the greatest loss. P: Those are they for whom is the worst of punishment, and in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers. S: These are they who shall have an evil punishment, and in the hereafter they shall be the greatest losers. 027.006 Y: As to thee, the Qur'an is bestowed upon thee from the presence of one Who is Wise and All-Knowing. P: Lo! as for thee (Muhammad), thou verily receivest the Qur'an from the presence of One Wise, Aware. S: And most surely you are made to receive the Quran from the Wise, the Knowing God. 027.007 Y: Behold! Moses said to his family: "I perceive a fire; soon will I bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand to light our fuel, that ye may warm yourselves." P: (Remember) when Moses said unto his household: Lo! I spy afar off a fire; I will bring you tidings thence, or bring to you a borrowed flame that ye may warm yourselves. S: When Musa said to his family: Surely I see fire; I will bring to you from it some news, or I will bring to you therefrom a burning firebrand so that you may warm yourselves. 027.008 Y: But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard: "Blessed are those in the fire and those around: and Glory to God, the Lord of the Worlds!" P: But when he reached it, he was called, saying: Blessed is Whosoever is in the fire and Whosoever is round about it! And Glorified be God, the Lord of the Worlds! S: So when he came to it a voice was uttered saying: Blessed is Whoever is in the fire and whatever is about it; and glory be to God, the Lord of the worlds; 027.009 Y: "O Moses! verily, I am God, the Exalted in Might, the Wise!" P: O Moses! Lo! it is I, God, the Mighty, the Wise. S: O Musa! surely I am God, the Mighty, the Wise; 027.010 Y: "Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: "O Moses!" (it was said), "Fear not: truly, in My presence, those called as messengers have no fear,"- P: And throw down thy staff! But when he saw it writhing as it were a demon, he turned to flee headlong; (but it was said unto him): O Moses! Fear not! the emissaries fear not in My presence, S: And cast down your staff. So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent, he turned back retreating and did not return: O Musa! fear not; surely the messengers shall not fear in My presence; 027.011 Y: "But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take the place of evil, truly, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." P: Save him who hath done wrong and afterward hath changed evil for good. And lo! I am Forgiving, Merciful. S: Neither he who has been unjust, then he does good instead after evil, for surely I am the Forgiving, the Merciful: 027.012 Y: "Now put thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm): (these are) among the nine Signs (thou wilt take) to Pharaoh and his people: for they are a people rebellious in transgression." P: And put thy hand into the bosom of thy robe, it will come forth white but unhurt. (This will be one) among nine tokens unto Pharaoh and his people Lo! they were ever evil-living folk. S: And enter your hand into the opening of your bosom, it shall come forth white without evil; among nine signs to Firon and his people, surely they are a transgressing people. 027.013 Y: But when Our Signs came to them, that should have opened their eyes, they said: "This is sorcery manifest!" P: But when Our tokens came unto them, plain to see, they said: This is mere magic, S: So when Our clear signs came to them, they said: This is clear enchantment. 027.014 Y: And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their souls were convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly! P: And they denied them, though their souls acknowledged them, for spite and arrogance. Then see the nature of the consequence for the wrong-doers! S: And they denied them unjustly and proudly while their soul had been convinced of them; consider, then how was the end of the mischief-makers. 027.015 Y: We gave (in the past) knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said: "Praise be to God, Who has favoured us above many of his servants who believe!" P: And We verily gave knowledge unto David and Solomon, and they said: Praise be to God, Who hath preferred us above many of His believing slaves! S: And certainly We gave knowledge to Dawood and Sulaiman, and they both said: Praise be to God, Who has made us to excel many of His believing servants. 027.016 Y: And Solomon was David's heir. He said: "O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds, and on us has been bestowed (a little) of all things: this is indeed Grace manifest (from God.)" P: And Solomon was David's heir. And he said: O mankind! Lo! we have been taught the language of birds, and have been given (abundance) of all things. This surely is evident favour. S: And Sulaiman was Dawood's heir, and he said: O men! we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given all things; most surely this is manifest grace. 027.017 Y: And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,- of jinns and men and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks. P: And there were gathered together unto Solomon his armies of the jinn and humankind, and of the birds, and they were set in battle order; S: And his hosts of the jinn and the men and the birds were gathered to him, and they were formed into groups. 027.018 Y: At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said: "O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it." P: Till, when they reached the Valley of the Ants, an ant exclaimed: O ants! Enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you, unperceiving. S: Until when they came to the valley of the Naml, a Namlite said: O Naml! enter your houses, (that) Sulaiman and his hosts may not crush you while they do not know. 027.019 Y: So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: "O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants." P: And (Solomon) smiled, laughing at her speech, and said: My Lord, arouse me to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and to do good that shall be pleasing unto Thee, and include me in (the number of) Thy righteous slaves. S: So he smiled, wondering at her word, and said: My Lord! grant me that I should be grateful for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I should do good such as Thou art pleased with, and make me enter, by Thy mercy, into Thy servants, the good ones. 027.020 Y: And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: "Why is it I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?" P: And he sought among the birds and said: How is it that I see not the hoopoe, or is he among the absent? S: And he reviewed the birds, then said: How is it I see not the hoopoe or is it that he is of the absentees? 027.021 Y: "I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty, or execute him, unless he bring me a clear reason (for absence)." P: I verily will punish him with hard punishment or I verily will slay him, or he verily shall bring me a plain excuse. S: I will most certainly punish him with a severe punishment, or kill him, or he shall bring to me a clear plea. 027.022 Y: But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: "I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true." P: But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not, and I come unto thee from Sheba with sure tidings. S: And he tarried not long, then said: I comprehend that which you do not comprehend and I have brought to you a sure information from Sheba. 027.023 Y: "I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne." P: Lo! I found a woman ruling over them, and she hath been given (abundance) of all things, and hers is a mighty throne. S: Surely I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given abundance and she has a mighty throne: 027.024 Y: "I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides God: Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes, and has kept them away from the Path,- so they receive no guidance,"- P: I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of God; and Satan maketh their works fairseeming unto them, and debarreth them from the way (of Truth), so that they go not aright; S: I found her and her people adoring the sun instead of God, and the Shaitan has made their deeds fair-seeming to them and thus turned them from the way, so they do not go aright; 027.025 Y: "(Kept them away from the Path), that they should not worship God, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what ye hide and wha""Believe in God and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their punishment. (As for) the fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes, and let not pity for them detain you in the matter of obedience to God, if you believe in God and the Last Day, and let a party of believers witness their chastisement.

Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the believers such a thing is forbidden. The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress, and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater. All that is forbidden unto believers.

And those who launch a charge against chaste women, and produce not four witnesses (to support their allegations), flog them with eighty stripes; and reject their evidence ever after: for such men are wicked transgressors. Unless they repent thereafter and mend (their conduct); for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have no evidence but their own, their solitary evidence can be received if they bear witness four times with an oath by God that they are solemnly telling the truth. And the fifth oath should be that they solemnly invoke the curse of God on themselves if they tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife if she bears witness four times with an oath by God that her husband is telling a lie. And the fifth oath should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of God on herself if her accuser is telling the truth.

If it were not for God's grace and mercy on you, and that God is Oft-Returning, Full of Wisdom, you would be ruined indeed. Those who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves: think it not to be an evil to you; on the contrary, it is good for you. To every man among them will come the punishment of the sin that he earned, and to him who took on himself the lead among them, will be a penalty grievous.

Why did not the believers, men and women, when you heard of the affair, put the best construction on it in their own minds and say, "This charge is an obvious lie"? Why did they not bring four witnesses to prove it? When they have not brought the witnesses, such men, in the sight of God, stand forth themselves as liars. Were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, in this world and the Hereafter, a grievous penalty would have seized you in that you rushed glibly into this affair.

Behold, you received it on your tongues, and said out of your mouths things of which you had no knowledge; and you thought it to be a light matter, while it was most serious in the sight of God. And why did you not, when you heard it, say, "It is not right of us to speak of this: Glory to God! This is a most serious slander!" God admonishes you that you may never repeat such conduct if you are true believers. And God makes the signs plain to you: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom.

Those who love to see scandal published among the believers will have a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: God knows, and you know not. Were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, and that God is full of kindness and mercy, you would be ruined indeed. O you who believe! Follow not Satan's footsteps: if any will follow the footsteps of Satan, he will but command what is shameful and wrong. And were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, not one of you would ever have been pure: but God purifies whom He pleases: and God is One Who hears and knows all things.

Let not those among you who are endowed with grace and amplitude of means resolve by oath against helping their kinsmen, those in want, and those who have left their homes in God's cause: let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that God should forgive you? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Those who slander chaste women, indiscreet but believing, are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous penalty. On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions."On the day when their tongues, hands, and feet will bear witness against them as to their actions. On that day, God will pay them back their just dues, and they will realize that God is the Truth, making all things manifest. Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure; and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity. These are not affected by what people say; for them, there is forgiveness and an honorable provision.

O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own without first asking permission and saluting those in them. If you find no one in the house, do not enter until permission is given to you. If you are asked to go back, go back; that is purer for you. It is no fault on your part to enter houses not used for living in, which serve some other use for you. God knows what you reveal and what you conceal.

Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that will make for greater purity for them. And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof. They should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, fathers, husbands' fathers, sons, husbands' sons, brothers, brothers' sons, sisters' sons, their women, slaves, male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex. They should not strike their feet to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. O believers, turn all together towards God, that you may attain bliss.

Marry those among you who are single, or the virtuous ones among yourselves, male or female. If they are in poverty, God will give them means out of His grace. Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste until God gives them means out of His grace. If any of your slaves ask for a deed in writing to earn their freedom, give them such a deed if you know any good in them. Do not compel your maids to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order to make a gain in the goods of this life. If anyone compels them, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful to them.

We have already sent down to you verses making things clear, an illustration from the story of people who passed away before you, and an admonition for those who fear God. God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as if there were a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp enclosed in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it. Light upon Light! God guides whom He will to His Light. God sets forth parables for men, and God knows all things.

This Light is found in houses which God has permitted to be raised to honor, for the celebration of His name. In them, He is glorified in the mornings and evenings by men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the remembrance of God, nor from regular prayer, nor from the practice of regular charity. Their only fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed.On the day when their tongues, hands, and feet will bear witness against them as to their actions. On that day, God will pay them back their just dues, and they will realize that God is the Truth, making all things manifest. Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure; and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity. These are not affected by what people say; for them, there is forgiveness and an honorable provision.

We have already sent down to you verses making things clear, an illustration from the story of people who passed away before you, and an admonition for those who fear God. God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as if there were a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp enclosed in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it.

This Light is found in houses which God has permitted to be raised to honor, for the celebration of His name. In them, He is glorified in the mornings and evenings by men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the remembrance of God, nor from regular prayer, nor from the practice of regular charity. Their only fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed.

That God may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace: for God doth provide for those whom He will, without measure. But the Unbelievers, their deeds are like a mirage in sandy deserts, which the man parched with thirst mistakes for water; until when he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing: But he finds God (ever) with him, and God will pay him his account: and God is swift in taking account. Or (the Unbelievers' state) is like the depths of darkness in a vast deep ocean, overwhelmed with billow topped by billow, topped by (dark) clouds: depths of darkness, one above another: if a man stretches out his hands, he can hardly see it! for any to whom God giveth not light, there is no light!

Seest thou not that it is God Whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do celebrate, and the birds (of the air) with wings outspread? Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise. And God knows well all that they do. Yea, to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to God is the final goal (of all). Seest thou not that God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a heap? - then wilt thou see rain issue forth from their midst. And He sends down from the sky mountain masses (of clouds) wherein is hail: He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases, the vivid flash of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight.

It is God Who alternates the Night and the Day: verily in these things is an instructive example for those who have vision! And God has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. God creates what He wills for verily God has power over all things. We have indeed sent down signs that make things manifest: and God guides whom He wills to a way that is straight.

They say, "We believe in God and in the messenger, and we obey": but even after that, some of them turn away: they are not (really) Believers. When they are summoned to God and His messenger, in order that He may judge between them, behold some of them decline (to come). But if the right is on their side, they come to him with all submission. Is it that there is a disease in their hearts? or do they doubt, or are they in fear, that God and His Messenger will deal unjustly with them? Nay, it is they themselves who do wrong.

The answer of the Believers, when summoned to God and His Messenger, in order that He may judge between them, is no other than this: they say, "We hear and we obey": it is such as these that will attain felicity. It is such as obey God and His Messenger, and fear God and do right, that will win (in the end). They swear their strongest oaths by God that, if only thou wouldst command them, they would leave (their homes). Say: "Swear ye not; Obedience is (more) reasonable; verily, God is well acquainted with all that ye do."

Say: "Obey God, and obey the Messenger: but if ye turn away, he is only responsible for the duty placed on him and ye for that placed on you. If ye obey him, ye shall be on right guidance. The Messenger's duty is only to preach the clear (Message)." God has promised, to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds, that He will, of a surety, grant them in the land, inheritance (of power), as He granted it to those before them; that He will establish in authority their religion - the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change (their state), after the fear in which they (lived), to one of security and peace: 'They will worship Me (alone) and not associate aught with Me.' If any do reject Faith after this, they are rebellious and wicked."t ye reveal." P: So that they worship not God, Who brings forth the hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you hide and what you make manifest. S: That they do not make obeisance to God, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you hide and what you make manifest. 027.026 Y: "God!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!" P: God; there is no God save Him, the Lord of the Tremendous Throne. S: God, there is no god but He: He is the Lord of mighty power. 027.027 Y: (Solomon) said: "Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!" P: (Solomon) said: We shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art of the liars. S: He said: We will see whether you have told the truth or whether you are of the liars. 027.028 Y: "Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw back from them, and (wait to) see what answer they return." P: Go with this my letter and throw it down unto them; then turn away and see what (answer) they return. S: Take this my letter and hand it over to them, then turn away from them and see what (answer) they return. 027.029 Y: (The queen) said: "Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy of respect." P: (The Queen of Sheba) said (when she received the letter): O chieftains! Lo! there hath been thrown unto me a noble letter. S: She said: O chief! surely an honorable letter has been delivered to me. 027.030 Y: "It is from Solomon, and is (as follows): 'In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.'" P: Lo! it is from Solomon, and lo! it is: In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful. S: Surely it is from Sulaiman, and surely it is in the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 027.031 Y: "'Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission (to the true Religion).'" P: Exalt not yourselves against me, but come unto me as those who surrender. S: Saying: exalt not yourselves against me and come to me in submission. 027.032 Y: She said: "Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided except in your presence." P: She said: O chieftains! Pronounce for me in my case. I decide no case till ye are present with me. S: She said: O chiefs! give me advice respecting my affair: I never decide an affair until you are in my presence. 027.033 Y: They said: "We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command." P: They said: We are lords of might and lords of great prowess, but it is for thee to command; so consider what thou wilt command. S: They said: We are possessors of strength and possessors of mighty prowess, and the command is yours, therefore see what you will command. 027.034 Y: She said: "Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave." P: She said: Lo! kings, when they enter a township, ruin it and make the honour of its people shame. Thus will they do. S: She said: Surely the kings, when they enter a town, ruin it and make the noblest of its people to be low, and thus they (always) do. 027.035 Y: "But I am going to send him a present, and (wait) to see with what (answer) return (my) ambassadors." P: But lo! I am going to send a present unto them, and to see with what (answer) the messengers return. S: And surely I am going to send a present to them, and shall wait to see what (answer) do the messengers bring back. 027.036 Y: Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon, he said: "Will ye give me abundance in wealth? But that which God has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!" P: So when (the envoy) came unto Solomon, (the King) said: What! Would ye help me with wealth? But that which God hath given me is better than that which He hath given you. Nay it is ye (and not I) who exult in your gift. S: So when he came to Sulaiman, he said: What! will you help me with wealth? But what God has given me is better than what He has given you. Nay, you are exultant because of your present. 027.037 Y: "Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace, and they will feel humbled (indeed)." P: Return unto them. We verily shall come unto them with hosts that they cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from thence with shame, and they will be abased. S: Go back to them, so we will most certainly come to them with hosts which they shall have no power to oppose, and we will most certainly expel them therefrom in abasement, and they shall be in a state of ignominy. 027.038 Y: He said (to his own men): "Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?" P: He said: O chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me, surrendering? S: He said: O chiefs! which of you can bring to me her throne before they come to me in submission? 027.039 Y: Said an 'Ifrit, of the jinns: "I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may be trusted." P: A stalwart of the jinn said: I will bring it thee before thou canst rise from thy place. Lo! I verily am strong and trusty for such work. S: One audacious among the jinn said: I will bring it to you before you rise up from your place; and most surely I am strong (and) trusty for it. 027.040 Y: Said one who had knowledge of the Book: "I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour!" P: One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it thee before thy gaze returneth unto thee. And when he saw it set in his presence, (Solomon) said: This is of the bounty of my Lord, that He may try me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful. Whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for (the good of) his own soul; and whosoever is ungrateful (is ungrateful only to his own soul's hurt). For lo! my Lord is Absolute in independence, Bountiful. S: One who had the knowledge of the Book said: I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye. Then when he saw it settled beside him, he said: This is of the grace of my Lord that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful; and whoever is grateful, he is grateful only for his own soul, and whoever is ungrateful, then surely my Lord is Self-sufficient, Honored. 027.041 Y: He said: "Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us see whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who receive no guidance." P: He said: Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will go aright or be of those not rightly guided. S: He said: Alter her throne for her, we will see whether she follows the right way or is of those who do not go aright. 027.042 Y: So when she arrived, she was asked, "Is this thy throne?" She said, "It was just like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we have submitted to God (in Islam)." P: So, when she came, it was said (unto her): Is thy throne like this? She said: (It is) as though it were the very one. And (Solomon said): We were given the knowledge before her and we had surrendered (to God). S: So when she came, it was said: Is your throne like this? She said: It is as it were the same, and we were given the knowledge before it, and we were submissive. 027.043 Y: And he diverted her from the worship of others besides God: for she was (sprung) of a people that had no faith. P: And (all) that she was wont to worship instead of God hindered her, for she came of disbelieving folk. S: And what she worshipped besides God prevented her, surely she was of an unbelieving people. 027.044 Y: She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought it was a lake of water, and she (tucked up her skirts), uncovering her legs. He said: "This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass." She said: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Islam), with Solomon, to the Lord of the Worlds." P: It was said unto her: Enter the hall. And when she saw it she deemed it a pool and bared her legs. (Solomon) said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of glass. She said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged myself, and I surrender with Solomon unto God, the Lord of the Worlds. S: It was said to her: Enter the palace; but when she saw it she deemed it to be a great expanse of water, and bared her legs. He said: Surely it is a palace made smooth with glass. She said: My Lord! surely I have been unjust to myself, and I submit with Sulaiman to God, the Lord of the worlds. 027.045 Y: We sent (aforetime), to the Thamud, their brother Salih, saying, "Serve God": But behold, they became two factions quarrelling with each other. P: And We verily sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying: Worship God. And lo! they (then) became two parties quarrelling. S: And certainly We sent to Samood their brother Salih, saying: Serve God; and lo! they became two sects quarrelling with each other. 027.046 Y: He said: "O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to the good? If only ye ask God for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy." P: He said: O my people! Why will ye hasten on the evil rather than the good? Why will ye not ask pardon of God, that ye may receive mercy. S: He said: O my people! why do you seek to hasten on the evil before the good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of God so that you may be dealt with mercifully? 027.047 Y: They said: "Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee." He said: "Your ill omen is with God; yea, ye are a people under trial." P: They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee. He said: Your evil augury is with God. Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested. S: They said: We have met with ill luck on account of you and on account of those with you. He said: The cause of your evil fortune is with God; nay, you are a people who are tried. 027.048 Y: There were in the city nine men of a family, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform. P: And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and reformed not. S: And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and did not act aright. 027.049 Y: They said: "Swear a mutual oath by God that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir (when he seeks vengeance): 'We were not present at the slaughter of his people, and we are positively telling the truth.'" P: They said: Swear one to another by God that we verily will attack him and his household by night, and after."Believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers those before them, and that He will most certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and that He will most certainly, after their fear, give them security in exchange; they shall serve Me, not associating aught with Me; and whoever is ungrateful after this, these it is who are the transgressors.

So establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and obey the Messenger; that ye may receive mercy. Establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey the messenger, that haply ye may find mercy. And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and obey the Messenger, so that mercy may be shown to you.

Never think thou that the Unbelievers are going to frustrate (God's Plan) on earth: their abode is the Fire, and it is indeed an evil refuge! Think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land. Fire will be their home - a hapless journey's end! Think not that those who disbelieve shall escape in the earth, and their abode is the fire; and certainly evil is the resort!

O ye who believe! let those whom your right hands possess, and the (children) among you who have not come of age ask your permission (before they come to your presence), on three occasions: before morning prayer; the while ye doff your clothes for the noonday heat; and after the late-night prayer: these are your three times of undress: outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about attending to each other: Thus does God make clear the Signs to you: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom. O ye who believe! Let your slaves, and those of you who have not come to puberty, ask leave of you at three times (before they come into your presence): Before the prayer of dawn, and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. Three times of privacy for you. It is no sin for them or for you at other times, when some of you go round attendant upon others (if they come into your presence without leave). Thus God maketh clear the revelations for you. God is Knower, Wise. O you who believe! let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times; before the morning prayer, and when you put off your clothes at midday in summer, and after the prayer of the nightfall; these are three times of privacy for you; neither is it a sin for you nor for them besides these, some of you must go round about (waiting) upon others; thus does God make clear to you the communications, and God is Knowing, Wise.

But when the children among you come of age, let them (also) ask for permission, as do those senior to them (in age): Thus does God make clear His Signs to you: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom. And when the children among you come to puberty then let them ask leave even as those before them used to ask it. Thus God maketh clear His revelations for you. God is Knower, Wise. And when the children among you have attained to puberty, let them seek permission as those before them sought permission; thus does God make clear to you His communications, and God is knowing, Wise.

Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage, there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) garments, provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty: but it is best for them to be modest: and God is One Who sees and knows all things. As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show adornment. But to refrain is better for them. God is Hearer, Knower. And (as for) women advanced in years who do not hope for a marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their ornaments; and if they restrain themselves it is better for them; and God is Hearing, Knowing.

It is no fault in the blind nor in one born lame, nor in one afflicted with illness, nor in yourselves, that ye should eat in your own houses, or those of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your father's brothers or your father's sisters, or your mother's brothers, or your mother's sisters, or in houses of which the keys are in your possession, or in the house of a sincere friend of yours: there is no blame on you, whether ye eat in company or separately. But if ye enter houses, salute each other - a greeting of blessing and purity as from God. Thus does God make clear the signs to you: that ye may understand. No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers, or the houses of your fathers' sisters, or the houses of your mothers' brothers, or the houses of your mothers' sisters, or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together or apart. But when ye enter houses, salute one another with a greeting from God, blessed and sweet. Thus God maketh clear His revelations for you, that haply ye may understand. There is no blame on the blind man, nor is there blame on the lame, nor is there blame on the sick, nor on yourselves that you eat from your houses, or your fathers' houses or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses, or your paternal uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or what you possess the keys of, or your friends' (houses). It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet your people with a salutation from God, blessed (and) goodly; thus does God make clear to you the communications that you may understand.

Only those are believers, who believe in God and His Messenger: when they are with him on a matter requiring collective action, they do not depart until they have asked for his leave; those who ask for thy leave are those who believe in God and His Messenger; so when they ask for thy leave, for some business of theirs, give leave to those of them whom thou wilt, and ask God for their forgiveness: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. They only are the true believers who believe in God and His messenger and, when they are with him on some common errand, go not away until they have asked leave of him. Lo! those who ask leave of thee, those are they who believe in God and His messenger. So, if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs, give leave to whom thou wilt of them, and ask for them forgiveness of God. Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. Only those are believers who believe in God and His Messenger, and when they are with him on a momentous affair they go not away until they have asked his permission; surely they who ask your permission are they who believe in God and His Messenger; so when they ask your permission for some affair of theirs, give permission to whom you please of them and ask forgiveness for them from God; surely God is Forgiving, Merciful.

Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another: God doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them. Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of another. God knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them. Do not hold the Messenger's calling (you) among you to be like your calling one to the other; God indeed knows those who steal away from among you, concealing themselves; therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement.

Be quite sure that to God doth belong whatever is in the heavens and on earth. Well doth He know what ye are intent upon: and one day they will be brought back to Him, and He will tell them the truth of what they did: for God doth know all things. Lo! verily unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. He knoweth your condition. And (He knoweth) the Day when they are returned unto Him so that He may inform them of what they did. God is Knower of all things. Now surely God's is whatever is in the heavens and the earth; He knows indeed that to which you are conforming yourselves; and on the day on which they are returned to Him He will inform them of what they did; and God is Cognizant of all things.

Chapter 25: AL-FURQAN (THE CRITERION, THE STANDARD)
Total Verses: 77
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Blessed is He who sent down the criterion to His servant, that it may be an admonition to all creatures. Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His slave the Criterion (of right and wrong), that he may be a warner to the peoples. Blessed is He Who sent down the Furqan upon His servant that he may be a warner to the nations.

He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: no son has He begotten, nor has He a partner in His dominion: it is He who created all things, and ordered them in due proportions. He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He hath chosen no son nor hath He any partner in the Sovereignty. He hath created everything and hath meted out for it a measure. He, Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Who did not take to Himself a son, and Who has no associate in the kingdom, and Who created everything, then ordained for it a measure.

Yet have they taken, besides him, gods that can create nothing but are themselves created; that have no control of hurt or good to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor resurrection. Yet they choose beside Him other gods who create naught but are themselves created, and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves, and possess not death nor life, nor power to raise the dead. And they have taken besides Him gods, who do not create anything while they are themselves created, and they control not for themselves any harm or profit, and they control not death nor life, nor raising (the dead) to life.

But the misbelievers say: "Naught is this but a lie which he has forged, and others have helped him at it." In truth it is they who have put forward an iniquity and a falsehood."And those who disbelieve say: "This is nothing but a lie which he has forged, and other people have helped him at it; so indeed they have done injustice and uttered a falsehood."

And they say: "Tales of the ancients, which he has caused to be written: and they are dictated before him morning and evening."

Say: "The Qur'an was sent down by Him who knows the mystery in the heavens and the earth: verily He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

And they say: "What sort of a messenger is this, who eats food, and walks through the streets? Why has not an angel been sent down to him to give admonition with him?"

Or "Why has not a treasure been bestowed on him, or why has he not a garden for enjoyment?" The wicked say: "Ye follow none other than a man bewitched."

See what kinds of comparisons they make for thee! But they have gone astray, and never a way will they be able to find!

Blessed is He who, if that were His will, could give thee better things than those—Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and He could give thee palaces secure to dwell in.

Nay, they deny the hour of judgment to come: but We have prepared a blazing fire for such as deny the hour.

When it sees them from a place far off, they will hear its fury and its ranging sigh.

And when they are cast, bound together into a constricted place therein, they will plead for destruction there and then!

"This day plead not for a single destruction: plead for destruction oft-repeated!"

Say: "Is that best, or the eternal garden, promised to the righteous? For them, that is a reward as well as a goal of attainment."

For them, there will be therein all that they wish for: they will dwell there for aye: A promise to be prayed for from thy Lord.

The day He will gather them together as well as those whom they worship besides God, He will ask: "Was it ye who let these My servants astray, or did they stray from the Path themselves?"

They will say: "Glory to Thee! Not meet was it for us that we should take for protectors others besides Thee: But Thou didst bestow on them and their fathers good things in life, until they forgot the Message: for they were a people worthless and lost."

(God will say): "Now have they proved you liars in what ye say: so ye cannot avert your penalty nor get help." And whoever among you does wrong, him shall We cause to taste a grievous Penalty.

And the messengers whom We sent before thee were all men who ate food and walked through the streets: We have made some of you as a trial for others: will ye have patience? For God is One Who sees all things.

Such as fear not the meeting with Us for Judgment say: "Why are not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord?" Indeed they have an arrogant conceit of themselves, and mighty is the insolence of their impiety!

The Day they see the angels, no joy will there be to the sinners that Day: The angels will say: "There is a barrier forbidden to you altogether!"

And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did in this life, and We shall make such deeds as floating dust scattered about.

The Companions of the Garden will be well, that Day, in their abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.

The Day the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and angels shall be sent down, descending in ranks.

That Day, the dominion as of right and truth, shall be wholly for God Most Merciful: it will be a Day of dire difficulty for the Misbelievers.

The Day that the wrong-doer will bite at his hands, he will say, "Oh! would that I had taken a straight path with the Messenger!"

"Ah! woe is me! Would that I had never taken such a one for a friend!"

"He did lead me astray from the Message of God after it had come to me! Ah! the Evil One is but a traitor to man!"ward we will surely say unto his friend: We witnessed not the destruction of his household. And lo! we are truthtellers. S: They said: Swear to each other by God that we will certainly make a sudden attack on him and his family by night, then we will say to his heir: We did not witness the destruction of his family, and we are most surely truthful. 027.050 Y: They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived it not. P: So they plotted a plot: and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not. S: And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan while they perceived not. 027.051 Y: Then see what was the end of their plot!- this, that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them). P: Then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting, for lo! We destroyed them and their people, every one. S: See, then, how was the end of their plan that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them). 027.052 Y: Now such were their houses, - in utter ruin, - because they practised wrong-doing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge. P: See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a people who have knowledge. S: So those are their houses fallen down because they were unjust, most surely there is a sign in this for a people who know. 027.053 Y: And We saved those who believed and practised righteousness. P: And we saved those who believed and used to ward off (evil). S: And We delivered those who believed and who guarded (against evil). 027.054 Y: (We also sent) Lut (as a messenger): behold, He said to his people, "Do ye do what is shameful though ye see (its iniquity)?" P: And Lot! when he said unto his folk: Will ye commit abomination knowingly? S: And (We sent) Lut, when he said to his people: What! do you commit indecency while you see? 027.055 Y: Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are a people (grossly) ignorant! P: Must ye seek lust after men instead of women? Nay, but ye are folk who act senselessly. S: What! do you indeed approach men lustfully rather than women? Nay, you are a people who act ignorantly. 027.056 Y: But his people gave no other answer but this: they said, "Drive out the followers of Lut from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!" P: But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said: Expel the household of Lot from your township, for they (forsooth) are folk who would keep clean! S: But the answer of his people was no other except that they said: Turn out Lut's followers from your town; surely they are a people who would keep pure! 027.057 Y: But We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lagged behind. P: Then We saved him and his household save his wife; We destined her to be of those who stayed behind. S: But We delivered him and his followers except his wife; We ordained her to be of those who remained behind. 027.058 Y: And We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! P: And We rained a rain upon them. Dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned. S: And We rained on them a rain, and evil was the rain of those who had been warned. 027.059 Y: Say: Praise be to God, and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen (for his Message). (Who) is better?- God or the false gods they associate (with Him)? P: Say (O Muhammad): Praise be to God, and peace be on His slaves whom He hath chosen! Is God best, or (all) that ye ascribe as partners (unto Him)? S: Say: Praise be to God and peace on His servants whom He has chosen: is God better, or what they associate (with Him)? 027.060 Y: Or, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who sends you down rain from the sky? Yea, with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full of beauty of delight: it is not in your power to cause the growth of the trees in them. (Can there be another) god besides God? Nay, they are a people who swerve from justice. P: Is not He (best) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down for you water from the sky wherewith We cause to spring forth joyous orchards, whose trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow. Is there any God beside God? Nay, but they are folk who ascribe equals (unto Him)! S: Nay, He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down for you water from the cloud; then We cause to grow thereby beautiful gardens; it is not possible for you that you should make the trees thereof to grow. Is there a god with God? Nay! they are people who deviate. 027.061 Y: Or, Who has made the earth firm to live in; made rivers in its midst; set thereon mountains immovable; and made a separating bar between the two bodies of flowing water? (can there be another) god besides God? Nay, most of them know not. P: Is not He (best) Who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in the folds thereof, and placed firm hills therein, and hath set a barrier between the two seas? Is there any God beside God? Nay, but most of them know not! S: Or, Who made the earth a resting place, and made in it rivers, and raised on it mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier. Is there a god with God? Nay! most of them do not know! 027.062 Y: Or, Who listens to the (soul) distressed when it calls on Him, and Who relieves its suffering, and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there be another) god besides God? Little it is that ye heed! P: Is not He (best) Who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto Him and removeth the evil, and hath made you viceroys of the earth? Is there any God beside God? Little do they reflect! S: Or, Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and removes the evil, and He will make you successors in the earth. Is there a god with God? Little is it that you mind! 027.063 Y: Or, Who guides you through the depths of darkness on land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy? (Can there be another) god besides God?- High is God above what they associate with Him! P: Is not He (best) Who guideth you in the darkness of the land and the sea, He Who sendeth the winds as heralds of His mercy? Is there any God beside God? High Exalted be God from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! S: Or, Who guides you in utter darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy. Is there a god with God? Exalted by God above what they associate (with Him). 027.064 Y: Or, Who originates creation, then repeats it, and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? (Can there be another) god besides God? Say, "Bring forth your argument, if ye are telling the truth!" P: Is not He (best) Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and Who provideth for you from the heaven and the earth? Is there any God beside God? Say: Bring your proof, if ye are truthful! S: Or, Who originates the creation, then reproduces it and Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth. Is there a god With God? Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful. 027.065 Y: Say: None in the heavens or on earth, except God, knows what is hidden: nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up (for Judgment). P: Say (O Muhammad): None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the Unseen save God; and they know not when they will be raised (again). S: Say: No one in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen but God; and they do not know when they shall be raised. 027.066 Y: Still less can their knowledge comprehend the Hereafter: Nay, they are in doubt and uncertainty thereanent; nay, they are blind thereunto! P: Nay, but doth their knowledge reach to the Hereafter? Nay, for they are in doubt concerning it. Nay, for they cannot see it. S: Nay, their knowledge respecting the hereafter is slight and hasty; nay, they are in doubt about it; nay, they are quite blind to it. 027.067 Y: The Unbelievers say: "What! when we become dust,- we and our fathers,- shall we really be raised (from the dead)?" P: Yet those who disbelieve say: When we have become dust like our fathers, shall we verily be brought forth (again)? S: And those who disbelieve say: What! when we have become dust and our fathers (too), shall we certainly be brought forth? 027.068 Y: "It is true we were promised this,- we and our fathers before (us): these are nothing but tales of the ancients." P: We were promised this, forsooth, we and our fathers. (All) this is naught but fables of the men of old. S: We have certainly been promised this, we and our fathers before; these are naught but stories of the ancients. 027.069 Y: Say: "Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty (of sin)." P: Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see the nature of the sequel for the guilty! S: Say: Travel in the earth, then see how was the end of the guilty. 027.070 Y: But grieve not over them, nor distress thyself because of their plots. P: And grieve thou not for them, nor be in distress because of what they plot (against thee). S: And grieve not for them and be not distressed because of what they plan. 027.071 Y: They also say: "When will this promise (come to pass)? (Say) if ye are truthful." P: And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful? S: And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful? 027.072 Y: Say: "It may be that some of the events which ye wish to hasten on may be (close) in your pursuit!" P: Say: It may be that a part of that which ye would hasten on is close behind you. S: Say: Maybe there may have drawn near to you somewhat of that which you seek to hasten on. 027.073 Y: But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them are ungrateful. P: Lo! thy Lord is full of bounty for mankind, but most of them do not give thanks. S: And surely your Lord is the Lord of grace to men, but most of them are not grateful. 027.074 Y: And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide. As well as all that they reveal. P: Lo! thy Lord knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide, and all that they proclaim. S: And most surely your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest. 027.075 Y: Nor is there aught of the unseen, in heaven or earth, but is (recorded) in a clear record. P: And there is nothing hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in a clear Record. S: And there is nothing concealed in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear book. 027.076 Y: Verily this Qur'an doth explain to the Children of Israel most of the matters in which they disagree. P: Lo! this Qur'an narrateth unto the Children of Israel most of that concerning which they differ. S: Surely this Quran declares to the children of Israel most of what they differ in. 027.077 Y: And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believe. P: And lo! it is a guidance and mercy for believers. 027.078: Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree: and He is Exalted in Might, All-Knowing. 027.079: So put thy trust in God: for thou art on (the path of) manifest Truth. 027.080: Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen, nor canst thou cause the deaf to hear the call, (especially) when they turn back in retreat. 027.081: Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind, (to prevent them) from straying: only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs, and they will bow in Islam. 027.082: And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust), we shall produce from the earth a beast to (face) them: He will speak to them, for that mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs. 027.083: One day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those who reject our Signs, and they shall be kept in ranks. 027.084: Until, when they come (before the Judgment-seat), (God) will say: "Did ye reject My Signs, though ye comprehended them not in knowledge, or what was it ye did?" 027.085: And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because of their wrong-doing, and they will be unable to speak (in plea). 027.086: See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day to give them light? Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe! 027.087: And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten with terror those who are in the heavens, and those who are on earth, except such as God will please (to exempt): and all shall come to His (Presence) as beings conscious of their lowliness. 027.088: Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of God, who disposes of all things in perfect order: for He is well acquainted with all that ye do. 027.089: If any do good, good will (accrue) to them therefrom; and they will be secure from terror that Day. 027.090: And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire: "Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?" 027.091: For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city, Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom (belong) all things: and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Islam to God's Will. 027.092: And to rehearse the Qur'an: and if any accept guidance, they do it for the good of their own souls, and if any stray, say: "I am only a Warner." 027.093: And say: "Praise be to God, Who will soon show you His Signs, so that ye shall know them"; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do.

Total Verses: 88
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

028.001: Ta. Sin. Mim.
028.002: These are Verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.
028.003: We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth, for people who believe.
028.004: Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections, depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew, but he kept alive their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief.
028.005: And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders (in Faith) and make them heirs.
028.006: To establish a firm place for them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Haman, and their hosts, at their hands, the very things against which they were taking precautions.
028.007: So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: "Suckle (thy child), but when thou hast fears about him, cast him into the river, but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one of Our messengers."
028.008: Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up (from the river): (It was intended) that (Moses) should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were men of sin.
028.009: The wife of Pharaoh said: "(Here is) joy of the eye, for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not (what they were doing).""r it had come to me; and the Shaitan fails to aid man. Then the Messenger will say: 'O my Lord! Truly my people took this Qur'an for just foolish nonsense.' And the messenger saith: 'O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Qur'an of no account.' And the Messenger cried out: 'O my Lord! surely my people have treated this Quran as a forsaken thing.'

Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners: but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help. Even so have We appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the guilty; but God sufficeth for a Guide and Helper. And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from among the sinners and sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and a Helper.

Those who reject Faith say: 'Why is not the Qur'an revealed to him all at once? Thus (is it revealed), that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and We have rehearsed it to thee in slow, well-arranged stages, gradually.' And those who disbelieve say: 'Why is the Qur'an not revealed unto him all at once? (It is revealed) thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith; and We have arranged it in right order.' And those who disbelieve say: 'Why has not the Quran been revealed to him all at once? Thus, that We may strengthen your heart by it and We have arranged it well in arranging.

And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth and the best explanation (thereof). And they bring thee no similitude but We bring thee the Truth (as against it), and better (than their similitude) as argument. And they shall not bring to you any argument, but We have brought to you (one) with truth and best in significance.

Those who will be gathered to Hell (prone) on their faces,- they will be in an evil plight, and, as to Path, most astray. Those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell: such are worse in plight and further from the right road. (As for) those who shall be gathered upon their faces to hell, they are in a worse plight and straying farther away from the path.

(Before this,) We sent Moses The Book, and appointed his brother Aaron with him as minister; We verily gave Moses the Scripture and placed with him his brother Aaron as henchman. And certainly We gave Musa the Book and We appointed with him his brother Haroun an aider.

And We command: 'Go ye both, to the people who have rejected our Signs:' And those (people) We destroyed with utter destruction. Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations. Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction. Then We said: Go you both to the people who rejected Our communications; so We destroyed them with utter destruction.

And the people of Noah,- when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and We made them as a Sign for mankind; and We have prepared for (all) wrong-doers a grievous Penalty; And Noah's folk, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and made of them a portent for mankind. We have prepared a painful doom for evil-doers. And the people of Nuh, when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and made them a sign for men, and We have prepared a painful punishment for the unjust;

As also 'Ad and Thamud, and the Companions of the Rass, and many a generation between them. And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud, and the dwellers in Ar-Rass, and many generations in between. And Ad and Samood and the dwellers of the Rass and many generations between them.

To each one We set forth Parables and examples; and each one We broke to utter annihilation (for their sins). Each (of them) We warned by examples, and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin. And to every one We gave examples and every one did We destroy with utter destruction.

And the (Unbelievers) must indeed have passed by the town on which was rained a shower of evil: did they not then see it (with their own eyes)? But they fear not the Resurrection. And indeed they have passed by the township whereon was rained the fatal rain. Can it be that they have not seen it? Nay, but they hope for no resurrection. And certainly they have (often) passed by the town on which was rained an evil rain; did they not then see it? Nay! they did not hope to be raised again.

When they see thee, they treat thee no otherwise than in mockery: 'Is this the one whom God has sent as a messenger?' And when they see thee (O Muhammad) they treat thee only as a jest (saying): Is this he whom God sendeth as a messenger? And when they see you, they do not take you for aught but a mockery: Is this he whom God has raised to be a messenger?

'He indeed would well-nigh have misled us from our gods, had it not been that we were constant to them!' - Soon will they know, when they see the Penalty, who it is that is most misled in Path! He would have led us far away from our gods if we had not been staunch to them. They will know, when they behold the doom, who is more astray as to the road. He had well-nigh led us astray from our gods had we not adhered to them patiently! And they will know, when they see the punishment, who is straying farther off from the path.

Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion (or impulse)? Couldst thou be a disposer of affairs for him? Hast thou seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust? Wouldst thou then be guardian over him? Have you seen him who takes his low desires for his god? Will you then be a protector over him?

Or thinkest thou that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle;- nay, they are worse astray in Path. Or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand? They are but as the cattle - nay, but they are farther astray? Or do you think that most of them do hear or understand? They are nothing but as cattle; nay, they are straying farther off from the path.

Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord?- How He doth prolong the shadow! If He willed, He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun its guide; Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade - And if He willed He could have made it still - then We have made the sun its pilot; Have you not considered (the work of) your Lord, how He extends the shade? And if He had pleased He would certainly have made it stationary; then We have made the sun an indication of it;

Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages. Then We withdraw it unto Us, a gradual withdrawal? Then We take it to Ourselves, taking little by little.

And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you, and Sleep as Repose, and makes the Day (as it were) a Resurrection. And He it is Who maketh night a covering for you, and sleep repose, and maketh day a resurrection. And He it is Who made the night a covering for you, and the sleep a rest, and He made the day to rise up again.

And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky,- And He it is Who sendeth the winds, glad tidings heralding His mercy, and We send down purifying water from the sky, And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy; and We send down pure water from the cloud,

That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things We have created,- cattle and men in great numbers. That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give many beasts and men that We have created to drink thereof. That We may give life thereby to a dead land and give it for drink, out of what We have created, to cattle and many people.

And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may celebrate (our) praises, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank) ingratitude. And verily We have repeated it among them that they may remember, but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude. And certainly We have repeated this to them that they may be mindful, but the greater number of men do not consent to aught except denying.

Had it been Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every centre of population. If We willed, We could raise up a warner in every village. And if We had pleased We would certainly have raised a warner in every town.

Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur'an). So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith with a great endeavour. So do not follow the unbelievers, and strive against them a mighty striving with it.

It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water: One palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter; yet has He made a barrier between them, a partition that is forbidden to be passed. And He it is Who hath given independence to the two seas (though they meet); one palatable, sweet, and the other saltish, bitter; and hath set a bar and a forbidding ban between them. And He it is Who has made two seas to flow freely, the one sweet that subdues thirst by its sweetness, and the other salt that burns by its saltness; and between the two He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction.

It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power (over all things). And He it is Who hath created man from water, and hath appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage; for thy Lord is ever Powerful. And He it is Who has created man from the water, then He has made for him blood relationship and marriage relationship, and your Lord is powerful.

Yet do they worship, besides God, things that can neither profit them nor harm them: and the Misbeliever is a helper (of Evil), against his own Lord! Yet they worship instead of God that which can neither benefit them nor hurt them. The disbeliever was ever a partisan against his Lord. And they serve besides God that which neither profits them nor causes them harm; and the unbeliever is a partisan against his Lord.

But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition. And We have sent thee (O Muhammad) only as a bearer of good tidings and a warner. And We have not sent you but as a giver of good news and as a warner.

Say: 'No reward do I ask of you for it but this: that each one who will may take a (straight) Path to his Lord.' Say: I ask of you no reward for this, save that whoso will may choose a way unto his Lord. Say: I do not ask you aught in return except that he who will, may take the way to his Lord.

And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate his praise; and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants."Trust in the Ever-living Who dies not, and celebrate His praise; He is aware of the faults of His servants. He created the heavens and the earth and all that is between in six days and is firmly established on the Throne. When told to prostrate to God Most Gracious, they question, increasing their aversion. Blessed is He Who made constellations, a lamp, and a moon giving light. He made the Night and the Day to follow each other for those who wish to celebrate His praises or show gratitude. The servants of God Most Gracious walk in humility, respond with "Peace" when addressed by the ignorant, and spend the night in adoration of their Lord. They pray to avert the Wrath of Hell, spend wisely, and avoid falsehood. They seek comfort in their families and strive to lead the righteous. They will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven for their patience, met with salutations and peace, and dwell there forever. Say to the rejecters: "My Lord is not uneasy because of you if you do not call on Him, but you have rejected, so judgment will come." 

Chapter 26: AL-SHUARA (THE POETS)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
These are verses of the Book that makes things clear. You may grieve that they do not become believers. If We willed, We could send down a sign from the sky to which they would bow. But they turn away from every new reminder from God Most Gracious. They have rejected the Message and will soon know the truth of what they mocked. Do they not see the earth and the noble things We have produced? Most do not believe, but your Lord is Mighty and Merciful. 

When your Lord called Moses, saying: "Go to the people of iniquity, the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear God?" Moses said: "O my Lord! I fear they will charge me with falsehood, my breast will be straitened, and my speech may not go smoothly; so send unto Aaron.""eived not. S: And Firon's wife said: A refreshment of the eye to me and to you; do not slay him; maybe he will be useful to us, or we may take him for a son; and they did not perceive. 028.010 Y: But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was going almost to disclose his (case), had We not strengthened her heart (with faith), so that she might remain a (firm) believer. P: And the heart of the mother of Moses became void, and she would have betrayed him if We had not fortified her heart, that she might be of the believers. S: And the heart of Musa's mother was free (from anxiety) she would have almost disclosed it had We not strengthened her heart so that she might be of the believers. 028.011 Y: And she said to the sister of (Moses), "Follow him" so she (the sister) watched him in the character of a stranger. And they knew not. P: And she said unto his sister: Trace him. So she observed him from afar, and they perceived not. S: And she said to his sister: Follow him up. So she watched him from a distance while they did not perceive, 028.012 Y: And we ordained that he refused suck at first, until (His sister came up and) said: "Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him?" P: And We had before forbidden foster-mothers for him, so she said: Shall I show you a household who will rear him for you and take care of him? S: And We ordained that he refused to suck any foster mother before, so she said: Shall I point out to you the people of a house who will take care of him for you, and they will be benevolent to him? 028.013 Y: Thus did We restore him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of God is true: but most of them do not understand. P: So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of God is true. But most of them know not. S: So We gave him back to his mother that her eye might be refreshed, and that she might no grieve, and that she might know that the promise of God is true, but most of them do not know. 028.014 Y: When he reached full age, and was firmly established (in life), We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge: for thus do We reward those who do good. P: And when he reached his full strength and was ripe, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward the good. S: And when he attained his maturity and became full grown, We granted him wisdom and knowledge; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others). 028.015 Y: And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching: and he found there two men fighting,- one of his own religion, and the other, of his foes. Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe, and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said: "This is a work of Evil (Satan): for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!" P: And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk, and he found therein two men fighting, one of his own caste, and the other of his enemies; and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is of the devil's doing. Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleader. S: And he went into the city at a time of unvigilance on the part of its people, so he found therein two men fighting, one being of his party and the other of his foes, and he who was of his party cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies, so Musa struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is on account of the Shaitan's doing; surely he is an enemy, openly leading astray. 028.016Y: He prayed: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me!" So (God) forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. P: He said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged my soul, so forgive me. Then He forgave him. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. S: He said: My Lord! surely I have done harm to myself, so do Thou protect me. So He protected him; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 028.017 Y: He said: "O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, never shall I be a help to those who sin!" P: He said: My Lord! Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me, I will nevermore be a supporter of the guilty. S: He said: My Lord! because Thou hast bestowed a favor on me, I shall never be a backer of the guilty. 028.018 Y: So he saw the morning in the city, looking about, in a state of fear, when behold, the man who had, the day before, sought his help called aloud for his help (again). Moses said to him: "Thou art truly, it is clear, a quarrelsome fellow!" P: And morning found him in the city, fearing, vigilant, when behold! he who had appealed to him the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said unto him: Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead. S: And he was in the city, fearing, awaiting, when lo! he who had asked his assistance the day before was crying out to him for aid. Musa said to him: You are most surely one erring manifestly. 028.019 Y: Then, when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them, that man said: "O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday? Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent man in the land, and not to be one who sets things right!" P: And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both, he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday. Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant in the land, thou wouldst not be of the reformers. S: So when he desired to seize him who was an enemy to them both, he said: O Musa! do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You desire nothing but that you should be a tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to be of those who act aright. 028.020 Y: And there came a man, running, from the furthest end of the City. He said: "O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee, to slay thee: so get thee away, for I do give thee sincere advice." P: And a man came from the uttermost part of the city, running. He said: O Moses! Lo! the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee; therefor escape. Lo! I am of those who give thee good advice. S: And a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said: O Musa! surely the chiefs are consulting together to slay you, therefore depart (at once); surely I am of those who wish well to you. 028.021Y: He therefore got away therefrom, looking about, in a state of fear. He prayed "O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing." P: So he escaped from thence, fearing, vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing folk. S: So he went forth therefrom, fearing, awaiting, (and) he said: My Lord! deliver me from the unjust people. 028.022Y: Then, when he turned his face towards (the land of) Madyan, he said: "I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path." P: And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said: Peradventure my Lord will guide me in the right road. S: And when he turned his face towards Madyan, he said: Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path. 028.023 Y: And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks), and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: "What is the matter with you?" They said: "We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take back (their flocks): And our father is a very old man." P: And when he came unto the water of Midian he found there a whole tribe of men, watering. And he found apart from them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What aileth you? The two said: We cannot give (our flocks) to drink till the shepherds return from the water; and our father is a very old man. S: And when he came to the water of Madyan, he found on it a group of men watering, and he found besides them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you? They said: We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their sheep) from the water, and our father is a very old man. 028.024 Y: So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade, and said: "O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any good that Thou dost send me!" P: So he watered (their flock) for them. Then he turned aside into the shade, and said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down for me. S: So he watered (their sheep) for them, then went back to the shade and said: My Lord! surely I stand in need of whatever good Thou mayest send down to me. 028.025 Y: Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him, walking bashfully. She said: "My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered (our flocks) for us." So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: "Fear thou not: (well) hast thou escaped from unjust people." P: Then there came unto him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said: Lo! my father biddeth thee, that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou didst water (the flock) for us. Then, when he came unto him and told him the (whole) story, he said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk. S: Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully. She said: My father invites you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for us. So when he came to him and gave to him the account, he said: Fear not, you are secure from the unjust people. 028.026 Y: Said one of the (damsels): "O my (dear) father! engage him on wages: truly the best of men for thee to employ is the (man) who is strong and trusty". P: One of the two women said: O my father! Hire him! For the best (man) that thou canst hire in the strong, the trustworthy. S: Said one of them: O my father! employ him, surely the best of those that you can employ is the strong man, the faithful one. 028.027 Y: He said: "I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee, on condition that thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years, it will be (grace) from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wilt find me, indeed, if God wills, one of the righteous." P: He said: Lo! I fain would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for (the term of) eight pilgrimages. Then if thou completest ten it will be of thine own accord, for I would not make it hard for thee. God willing, thou wilt find me of the righteous. S: He said: I desire to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition that you should serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will, and I do not wish to be hard to you; if God please, you will find me one of the good. 028.028 Y: He said: "Be that (the agreement) between me and thee"Thou to Haroun (to help me); 026.014 Y: "And (further), they have a charge of crime against me; and I fear they may slay me." P: And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. S: And they have a crime against me, therefore I fear that they may slay me. 026.015 Y: God said: "By no means! proceed then, both of you, with Our Signs; We are with you, and will listen (to your call)." P: He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing. S: He said: By no means, so go you both with Our signs; surely We are with you, hearing; 026.016 Y: "So go forth, both of you, to Pharaoh, and say: 'We have been sent by the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds;'" P: And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds, S: Then come to Firon and say: Surely we are the messengers of the Lord of the worlds: 026.017 Y: "'Send thou with us the Children of Israel.'" P: (Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. S: Then send with us the children of Israel. 026.018 Y: (Pharaoh) said: "Did we not cherish thee as a child among us, and didst thou not stay in our midst many years of thy life?" P: (Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, S: (Firon) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you tarried among us for (many) years of your life? 026.019 Y: "And thou didst a deed of thine which (thou knowest) thou didst, and thou art an ungrateful (wretch)!" P: And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates. S: And you did (that) deed of yours which you did, and you are one of the ungrateful. 026.020 Y: Moses said: "I did it then, when I was in error." P: He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. S: He said: I did it then while I was of those unable to see the right course; 026.021 Y: "So I fled from you (all) when I feared you; but my Lord has (since) invested me with judgment (and wisdom) and appointed me as one of the messengers." P: Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). S: So I fled from you when I feared you, then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me of the messengers; 026.022 Y: "And this is the favour with which thou dost reproach me,- that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel!" P: And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel. S: And is it a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of Israel? 026.023 Y: Pharaoh said: "And what is the 'Lord and Cherisher of the worlds'?" P: Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds? S: Firon said: And what is the Lord of the worlds? 026.024 Y: (Moses) said: "The Lord and Cherisher of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- if ye want to be quite sure." P: (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief. S: He said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would be sure. 026.025 Y: (Pharaoh) said to those around: "Did ye not listen (to what he says)?" P: (Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not? S: (Firon) said to those around him: Do you not hear? 026.026 Y: (Moses) said: "Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning!" P: He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. S: He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old. 026.027 Y: (Pharaoh) said: "Truly your messenger who has been sent to you is a veritable madman!" P: (Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman! S: Said he: Most surely your Messenger who is sent to you is mad. 026.028 Y: (Moses) said: "Lord of the East and the West, and all between! if ye only had sense!" P: He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand. S: He said: The Lord of the east and the west and what is between them, if you understand. 026.029 Y: (Pharaoh) said: "If thou dost put forward any god other than me, I will certainly put thee in prison!" P: (Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners. S: Said he: If you will take a god besides me, I will most certainly make you one of the imprisoned. 026.030 Y: (Moses) said: "Even if I showed you something clear (and) convincing?" P: He said: Even though I show thee something plain? S: He said: What! even if I bring to you something manifest? 026.031 Y: (Pharaoh) said: "Show it then, if thou tellest the truth!" P: (Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! S: Said he: Bring it then, if you are of the truthful ones. 026.032 Y: So (Moses) threw his rod, and behold, it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)! P: Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, S: So he cast down his rod, and lo! it was an obvious serpent, 026.033 Y: And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders! P: And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. S: And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it appeared white to the onlookers. 026.034 Y: (Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs around him: "This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed:" P: (Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard, S: (Firon) said to the chiefs around him: Most surely this is a skillful magician, 026.035 Y: "His plan is to get you out of your land by his sorcery; then what is it ye counsel?" P: Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye? S: Who desires to turn you out of your land with his magic; what is it then that you advise? 026.036 Y: They said: "Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while), and dispatch to the Cities heralds to collect-" P: They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities summoners, S: They said: Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities; 026.037 Y: "And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed." P: Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. S: That they should bring to you every skillful magician. 026.038 Y: So the sorcerers were got together for the appointment of a day well-known, P: So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. S: So the magicians were gathered together at the appointed time on the fixed day, 026.039 Y: And the people were told: "Are ye (now) assembled?"- P: And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering? S: And it was said to the people: Will you gather together? 026.040 Y: "That we may follow the sorcerers (in religion) if they win?" P: (They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. S: Haply we may follow the magicians, if they are the vanquishers. 026.041 Y: So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh: "Of course - shall we have a (suitable) reward if we win?" P: And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners? S: And when the magicians came, they said to Firon: Shall we get a reward if we are the vanquishers? 026.042 Y: He said: "Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person)." P: He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). S: He said: Yes, and surely you will then be of those who are made near. 026.043 Y: Moses said to them: "Throw ye - that which ye are about to throw!" P: Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! S: Musa said to them: Cast what you are going to cast. 026.044 Y: So they threw their ropes and their rods, and said: "By the might of Pharaoh, it is we who will certainly win!" P: Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's might, lo! we verily are the winners. S: So they cast down their cords and their rods and said: By Firon's power, we shall most surely be victorious. 026.045 Y: Then Moses threw his rod, when, behold, it straightway swallows up all the falsehoods which they fake! P: Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show. S: Then Musa cast down his staff and lo! it swallowed up the lies they told. 026.046 Y: Then did the sorcerers fall down, prostrate in adoration, P: And the wizards were flung prostrate, S: And the magicians were thrown down prostrate; 026.047 Y: Saying: "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds," P: Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, S: They said: We believe in the Lord of the worlds: 026.048 Y: "The Lord of Moses and Aaron." P: The Lord of Moses and Aaron. S: The Lord of Musa and Haroun. 026.049 Y: Said (Pharaoh): "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? surely he is your leader, who has taught you sorcery! but soon shall ye know!" - "Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross!" P: (Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every one. S: Said he: You believe in him before I give you permission; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you the magic, so you shall know: certainly I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and certainly I will crucify you all. 026.050 Y: They said: "No matter! for us, we shall but return to our Lord!" P: They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. S: They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we go back; 026.051 Y: "Only, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults, that we may become foremost among the believers!" P: Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers. S: Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of the believers. 026.052 Y: By inspiration we told Moses: "Travel by night with my servants; for surely ye shall be pursued." P: And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued. S: And We revealed to Musa, saying: Go away with My servants travelling by night, surely you will be pursued. 026.053 Y: Then Pharaoh sent heralds to (all) the Cities, P: Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, S: So Firon sent heralds into the cities; 026.054 Y: (Saying): "These (Israelites) are but a small band," P: (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, S: Most surely these are a small company; 026.055 Y: "And they are raging furiously against us;" P: And lo! they are offenders against us. S: And most surely they have enraged us; 026.056 Y: "But we are a multitude amply fore-warned." P: And lo! we are a ready host. S: And most surely we are a vigilant multitude. 026.057 Y: So We expelled them from gardens, springs, P: Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, 026.058 Y: Treasures, and every kind of honourable position; P: And treasures and a fair estate. 026.059 Y: Thus it was, but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things. P: Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them. 026.060 Y: So they pursued them at sunrise. P: And they overtook them at sunrise. 026.061 Y: And when the two bodies saw each other, the people of Moses said: "We are sure to be overtaken." P: And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are indeed caught. 026.062 Y: (Moses) said: "By no means! my Lord is with me! Soon will He guide me!" P: He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. 026.063 Y: Then We told Moses by inspiration: "Strike the sea with thy rod." So it divided, and each separate part became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain. P: Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast. 026.064 Y: And We made the other party approach thither. P: Then brought We near the others to that place. 026.065 Y: We delivered Moses and all who were with him; P: And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; 026.066 Y: But We drowned the others. P: And We drowned the others. 026.067 Y: Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 026.068 Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. P: And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 026.069 Y: And rehearse to them (something of) Abraham's story. P: Recite unto them the story of Abraham: 026.070 Y: Behold, he said to his father and his people: "What worship ye?" P: When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye? 026.071 Y: They said: "We worship idols, and we remain constantly in attendance on them." P: They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. 026.072 Y: He said: "Do they listen to you when ye call (on them)," P: He said: Do they hear you when ye cry? 026.073 Y: "Or do you good or harm?" P: Or do they benefit or harm you? 026.074 Y: They said: "Nay, but we found our fathers doing thus (what we do)." P: They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. 026.075 Y: He said: "Do ye then see whom ye have been worshipping,"- P: He said: See now that which ye worship, 026.076 Y: "Ye and your fathers before you?"- P: Ye and your forefathers! 026.077 Y: "For they are enemies to me; not so the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds;" P: Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, 026.078 Y: "Who created me, and it is He Who guides me;" P: Who created me, and He doth guide me, 026.079 Y: "Who gives me food and drink," P: And Who feedeth me and watereth me. 026.080 Y: "And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me;" P: And when I sicken, then He healeth me, 026.081 Y: "Who will cause me to die, and then to life (again);" P: And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), 026.082 Y: "And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Judgment." P: And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. 026.083 Y: "O my Lord! bestow wisdom on me, and join me with the righteous;" P: My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. 026.084 Y: "Grant me honourable mention on the tongue of truth among the latest (generations);" P: And give unto me a good report in later generations. 026.085 Y: "Make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss;" P: And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, 026.086 Y: "Forgive my father, for that he is among those astray;" P: And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err. 026.087 Y: "And let me not be in disgrace on the Day when (men) will be raised up;"- P: And abase me not on the day when they are raised, 026.088 Y: "The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail," P: The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man) 026.089 Y: "But only he (will prosper) that brings to God a sound heart;" P: Save him who bringeth unto God a whole heart. 026.090 Y: "To the righteous, the Garden will be brought near," P: And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil). 026.091 Y: "And to those straying in Evil, the Fire will be placed in full view;" P: And hell will appear plainly to the erring. 026.092 Y: "And it shall be said to them: 'Where are the (gods) ye worshipped-'" P: And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship 026.093 Y: "'Besides God? Can they help you or help themselves?'" P: Instead of God? Can they help you or help themselves? 026.094 Y: "Then they will be thrown headlong into the (Fire),- they and those straying in Evil," P: Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers 026.095 Y: "And the whole hosts of Iblis together." P: And the hosts of Iblis, together. 026.096 Y: "They will say there in their mutual bickerings:" P: And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: 026.097 Y: "'By God, we were truly in an error manifest," P: By God, of a truth we were in error manifest 026.098 Y: "'When we held you as equals with the Lord of the Worlds;" P: When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. 026.099 Y: "'And our seducers were only those who were steeped in guilt." P: It was but the guilty who misled us. 026.100 Y: "'Now, then, we have none to intercede (for us),'" P: Now we have no intercessors 026.101 Y: "'Nor a single friend to feel (for us).'" P: Nor any loving friend. 026.102 Y: "'Now if we only had a chance of return we shall truly be of those who believe!'" P: Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers! 026.103 Y: Verily in this is a Sign but most of them do not believe. P: Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers! 026.104 Y: And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. P: And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 026.105 Y: The people of Noah rejected the messengers. P: Noah's folk denied the messengers (of God), 026.106 Y: Behold, their brother Noah said to them: "Will ye not fear (God)?" P: When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil)? 026.107 Y: "I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust:" P: Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 026.108 Y: "So fear God, and obey me." P: So keep your duty to God, and obey me. 026.109 Y: "No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds:" P: And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. 026.110 Y: "So fear God, and obey me." P: So keep your duty to God, and obey me. 026.111 Y: They said: "Shall we believe in thee when it is the meanest that follow thee?" P: They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow thee? 026.112 Y: He said: "And what do I know as to what they do?" P: He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in the past)? 026.113 Y: "Their account is only with my Lord, if ye could (but) understand." P: Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; 026.114 Y: "I am not one to drive away those who believe." P: And I am not (here) to repulse believers. 026.115 Y: "I am sent only to warn plainly in public." P: I am only a plain warner. 026.116 Y: They said: "If thou desist not, O Noah! thou shalt be stoned (to death)." P: They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned (to death).": whichever of the two terms I fulfil, let there be no ill-will to me. Be God a witness to what we say." P: He said: That (is settled) between thee and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice to me, and God is Surety over what we say. S: He said: This shall be (an agreement) between me and you; whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and God is a witness of what we say. 028.029 Y: Now when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: "Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; I hope to bring you from there some information, or a burning firebrand, that ye may warm yourselves." P: Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his housefolk, he saw in the distance a fire and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye (here). Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence, or a brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves. S: So when Musa had fulfilled the term, and he journeyed with his family, he perceived on this side of the mountain a fire. He said to his family: Wait, I have seen a fire, maybe I will bring to you from it some news or a brand of fire, so that you may warm yourselves. 028.030 Y: But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in hallowed ground: "O Moses! Verily I am God, the Lord of the Worlds." P: And when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field, from the tree: O Moses! Lo! I, even I, am God, the Lord of the Worlds; S: And when he came to it, a voice was uttered from the right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush, saying: O Musa! surely I am God, the Lord of the worlds. 028.031 Y: "Now do thou throw thy rod!" but when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: "O Moses!" (It was said), "Draw near, and fear not: for thou art of those who are secure." P: Throw down thy staff. And when he saw it writhing as it had been a demon, he turned to flee headlong, (and it was said unto him): O Moses! Draw nigh and fear not. Lo! thou art of those who are secure. S: And saying: Cast down you staff. So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent, he turned back retreating, and did not return. O Musa! come forward and fear not; surely you are of those who are secure; 028.032 Y: "Move thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm), and draw thy hand close to thy side (to guard) against fear. Those are the two credentials from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: for truly they are a people rebellious and wicked." P: Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white without hurt. And guard thy heart from fear. Then these shall be two proofs from your Lord unto Pharaoh and his chiefs. Lo! they are evil-living folk. S: Enter your hand into the opening of your bosom, it will come forth white without evil, and draw your hand to yourself to ward off fear: so these two shall be two arguments from your Lord to Firon and his chiefs, surely they are a transgressing people. 028.033 Y: He said: "O my Lord! I have slain a man among them, and I fear lest they slay me." P: He said: My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me. S: He said: My Lord! surely I killed one of them, so I fear lest they should slay me; 028.034 Y: "And my brother Aaron - He is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper, to confirm (and strengthen) me: for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood." P: My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech. Therefore send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Lo! I fear that they will give the lie to me. S: And my brother, Haroun, he is more eloquent of tongue than I, therefore send him with me as an aider, verifying me: surely I fear that they would reject me. 028.035 Y: He said: "We will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother, and invest you both with authority, so they shall not be able to touch you: with Our Sign shall ye triumph,- you two as well as those who follow you." P: He said: We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother, and We will give unto you both power so that they cannot reach you for Our portents. Ye twain, and those who follow you, will be the winners. S: He said: We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and We will give you both an authority, so that they shall not reach you; (go) with Our signs; you two and those who follow you shall be uppermost. 028.036 Y: When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said: "This is nothing but sorcery faked up: never did we head the like among our fathers of old!" P: But when Moses came unto them with Our clear tokens, they said: This is naught but invented magic. We never heard of this among our fathers of old. S: So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they said: This is nothing but forged enchantment, and we never heard of it amongst our fathers of old. 028.037 Y: Moses said: "My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper." P: And Moses said: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance from His presence, and whose will be the sequel of the Home (of bliss). Lo! wrong-doers will not be successful. S: And Musa said: My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him, and whose shall be the good end of the abode; surely the unjust shall not be successful. 028.038 Y: Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself: therefore, O Haman! light me a (kiln to bake bricks) out of clay, and build me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned, I think (Moses) is a liar!" P: And Pharaoh said: O chiefs! I know not that ye have a god other than me, so kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey the god of Moses; and lo! I deem him of the liars. S: And Firon said: O chiefs! I do not know of any god for you besides myself; therefore kindle a fire for me, O Haman, for brick, then prepare for me a lofty building so that I may obtain knowledge of Musa's god, and most surely I think him to be one of the liars. 028.039 Y: And he was arrogant and insolent in the land, beyond reason,- He and his hosts: they thought that they would not have to return to Us! P: And he and his hosts were haughty in the land without right, and deemed that they would never be brought back to Us. S: And he was unjustly proud in the land, he and his hosts, and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us. 028.040 Y: So We seized him and his hosts, and We flung them into the sea: Now behold what was the end of those who did wrong! P: Therefore We seized him and his hosts, and abandoned them unto the sea. Behold the nature of the consequence for evil-doers! S: So We caught hold of him and his hosts, then We cast them into the sea, and see how was the end of the unjust. 028.041 Y: And we made them (but) leaders inviting to the Fire; and on the Day of Judgment no help shall they find. P: And We made them patterns that invite unto the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. S: And We made them Imams who call to the fire, and on the day of resurrection they shall not be assisted. 028.042 Y: In this world We made a curse to follow them and on the Day of Judgment they will be among the loathed (and despised). P: And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the hateful. S: And We caused a curse to follow them in this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be of those made to appear hideous. 028.043 Y: We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations, (to give) Insight to men, and guidance and Mercy, that they might receive admonition. P: And We verily gave the Scripture unto Moses after We had destroyed the generations of old: clear testimonies for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that haply they might reflect. S: And certainly We gave Musa the Book after We had destroyed the former generations, clear arguments for men and a guidance and a mercy, that they may be mindful. 028.044 Y: Thou wast not on the Western side when We decreed the Commission to Moses, nor wast thou a witness (of those events). P: And thou (Muhammad) wast not on the western side (of the Mount) when We expounded unto Moses the commandment, and thou wast not among those present; S: And you were not on the western side when We revealed to Musa the commandment, and you were not among the witnesses; 028.045 Y: But We raised up (new) generations, and long were the ages that passed over them; but thou wast not a dweller among the people of Madyan, rehearsing Our Signs to them; but it is We Who send messengers (with inspiration). P: But We brought forth generations, and their lives dragged on for them. And thou wast not a dweller in Midian, reciting unto them Our revelations, but We kept sending (messengers to men). S: But We raised up generations, then life became prolonged to them; and you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our communications, but We were the senders. 028.046 Y: Nor wast thou at the side of (the Mountain of) Tur when we called (to Moses). Yet (art thou sent) as Mercy from thy Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before thee: in order that they may receive admonition. P: And thou was not beside the Mount when We did call; but (the knowledge of it is) a mercy from thy Lord that thou mayst warn a folk unto whom no warner came before thee, that haply they may give heed. S: And you were not on this side of the mountain when We called, but a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you, that they may be mindful. 028.047 Y: If (We had) not (sent thee to the Quraish),- in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds) that their hands have sent forth, they might say: "Our Lord! why didst Thou not sent us a messenger? We should then have followed Thy Signs and been amongst those who believe!" P: Otherwise, if disaster should afflict them because of that which their own hands have sent before (them), they might say: Our Lord! Why sentest Thou no messenger unto us, that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the believers? S: And were it not that there should befall them a disaster for what their hands have sent before, then they should say: Our Lord! why didst Thou not send to us a messenger so that we should have followed Thy communications and been of the believers! 028.048 Y: But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, "Why are not (Signs) sent to him, like those which were sent to Moses?" Do they not then reject""f those stoned to death. 026.117 Y: He said: "O my Lord! truly my people have rejected me." P: He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. S: He said: My Lord! Surely my people give me the lie! 026.118 Y: "Judge Thou, then, between me and them openly, and deliver me and those of the Believers who are with me." P: Therefore judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me. S: Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just) judgment, and deliver me and those who are with me of the believers. 026.119 Y: So We delivered him and those with him, in the Ark filled (with all creatures). P: And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. S: So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark. 026.120 Y: Thereafter We drowned those who remained behind. P: Then afterward We drowned the others. S: Then We drowned the rest afterwards 026.121 Y: Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. P: Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.

They say: 'Two kinds of sorcery, each assisting the other!' And they say: 'For us, we reject all (such things)!' P: But when there came unto them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Why is he not given the like of what was given unto Moses? Did they not disbelieve in that which was given unto Moses of old? They say: Two magics that support each other; and they say: Lo! in both we are disbelievers. S: But (now) when the truth has come to them from Us, they say: Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa? What! did they not disbelieve in what Musa was given before? They say: Two magicians backing up each other; and they say: Surely we are unbelievers in all. 028.049 Y: Say: 'Then bring ye a Book from God, which is a better guide than either of them, that I may follow it! (do), if ye are truthful!' P: Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Then bring a scripture from the presence of God that giveth clearer guidance than these two (that) I may follow it, if ye are truthful. S: Say: Then bring some (other) book from God which is a better guide than both of them, (that) I may follow it, if you are truthful. 028.050 Y: But if they hearken not to thee, know that they only follow their own lusts: and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts, devoid of guidance from God? for God guides not people given to wrong-doing. P: And if they answer thee not, then know that what they follow is their lusts. And who goeth farther astray than he who followeth his lust without guidance from God. Lo! God guideth not wrongdoing folk. S: But if they do not answer you, then know that they only follow their low desires; and who is more erring than he who follows his low desires without any guidance from God? Surely God does not guide the unjust people. 028.051 Y: Now have We caused the Word to reach them themselves, in order that they may receive admonition. P: And now verily We have caused the Word to reach them, that haply they may give heed. S: And certainly We have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful. 028.052 Y: Those to whom We sent the Book before this,- they do believe in this (revelation): P: Those unto whom We gave the Scripture before it, they believe in it, S: (As to) those whom We gave the Book before it, they are believers in it. 028.053 Y: And when it is recited to them, they say: 'We believe therein, for it is the Truth from our Lord: indeed we have been Muslims (bowing to God's Will) from before this.' P: And when it is recited unto them, they say: We believe in it. Lo! it is the Truth from our Lord. Lo! even before it we were of those who surrender (unto Him). S: And when it is recited to them they say: We believe in it surely it is the truth from our Lord; surely we were submitters before this. 028.054 Y: Twice will they be given their reward, for that they have persevered, that they avert Evil with Good, and that they spend (in charity) out of what We have given them. P: These will be given their reward twice over, because they are steadfast and repel evil with good, and spend of that wherewith We have provided them, S: These shall be granted their reward twice, because they are steadfast and they repel evil with good and spend out of what We have given them. 028.055 Y: And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: 'To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant.' P: And when they hear vanity they withdraw from it and say: Unto us our works and unto you your works. Peace be unto you! We desire not the ignorant. S: And when they hear idle talk they turn aside from it and say: We shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; peace be on you, we do not desire the ignorant. 028.056 Y: It is true thou wilt not be able to guide every one, whom thou lovest; but God guides those whom He will and He knows best those who receive guidance. P: Lo! thou (O Muhammad) guidest not whom thou lovest, but God guideth whom He will. And He is Best Aware of those who walk aright. S: Surely you cannot guide whom you love, but God guides whom He pleases, and He knows best the followers of the right way. 028.057 Y: They say: 'If we were to follow the guidance with thee, we should be snatched away from our land.' Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary, to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds,- a provision from Ourselves? but most of them understand not. P: And they say: If we were to follow the Guidance with thee we should be torn out of our land. Have We not established for them a sure sanctuary, whereunto the produce of all things is brought (in trade), a provision from Our presence? But most of them know not. S: And they say: If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be carried off from our country. What! have We not settled them in a safe, sacred territory to which fruits of every kind shall be drawn? a sustenance from Us; but most of them do not know. 028.058 Y: And how many populations We destroyed, which exulted in their life (of ease and plenty)! now those habitations of theirs, after them, are deserted,- All but a (miserable) few! and We are their heirs! P: And how many a community have We destroyed that was thankless for its means of livelihood! And yonder are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited after them save a little. And We, even We, were the inheritors. S: And how many a town have We destroyed which exulted in its means of subsistence, so these are their abodes, they have not been dwelt in after them except a little, and We are the inheritors, 028.059 Y: Nor was thy Lord the one to destroy a population until He had sent to its centre a messenger, rehearsing to them Our Signs; nor are We going to destroy a population except when its members practise iniquity. P: And never did thy Lord destroy the townships, till He had raised up in their mother(-town) a messenger reciting unto them Our revelations. And never did We destroy the townships unless the folk thereof were evil-doers. S: And your Lord never destroyed the towns until He raised in their metropolis a messenger, reciting to them Our communications, and We never destroyed the towns except when their people were unjust. 028.060 Y: The (material) things which ye are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter thereof; but that which is with God is better and more enduring: will ye not then be wise? P: And whatsoever ye have been given is a comfort of the life of the world and an ornament thereof; and that which God hath is better and more lasting. Have ye then no sense? S: And whatever things you have been given are only a provision of this world's life and its adornment, and whatever is with God is better and more lasting; do you not then understand? 028.061 Y: Are (these two) alike?- one to whom We have made a goodly promise, and who is going to reach its (fulfilment), and one to whom We have given the good things of this life, but who, on the Day of Judgment, is to be among those brought up (for punishment)? P: Is he whom We have promised a fair promise which he will find (true) like him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned? S: Is he to whom We have promised a goodly promise which he shall meet with like him whom We have provided with the provisions of this world's life, then on the day of resurrection he shall be of those who are brought up? 028.062 Y: That Day (God) will call to them, and say 'Where are my 'partners'?- whom ye imagined (to be such)?' P: On the day when He will call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom ye imagined? S: And on the day when He will call them and say: Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates? 028.063 Y: Those against whom the charge will be proved, will say: 'Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray: we led them astray, as we were astray ourselves: we free ourselves (from them) in Thy presence: it was not us they worshipped.' P: Those concerning whom the Word will have come true will say: Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray even as we ourselves were astray. We declare our innocence before Thee: us they never worshipped. S: Those against whom the sentence has become confirmed will say: Our Lord! these are they whom we caused to err; we caused them to err as we ourselves did err; to Thee we declare ourselves to be clear (of them); they never served Us. 028.064 Y: It will be said (to them): 'Call upon your 'partners' (for help)': they will call upon them, but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Penalty (before them); (how they will wish) 'if only they had been open to guidance!' P: And it will be said: Cry unto your (so-called) partners (of God). And they will cry unto them, and they will give no answer unto them, and they will see the Doom. Ah, if they had but been guided! S: And it will be said: Call your associate-gods. So they will call upon them, but they will not answer them, and they shall see the punishment; would that they had followed the right way! 028.065 Y: That Day (God) will call to them, and say: 'What was the answer ye gave to the messengers?' P: And on the Day when He will call unto them and say: What answer gave ye to the messengers? S: And on the day when He shall call them and say: What was the answer you gave to the messengers? 028.066 Y: Then the (whole) story that Day will seem obscure to them (like light to the blind) and they will not be able (even) to question each other. P: On that day (all) tidings will be dimmed for them, nor will they ask one of another, S: Then the pleas shall become obscure to them on that day, so they shall not ask each other. 028.067 Y: But any that (in this life) had repented, believed, and worked righteousness, will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation. P: But as for him who shall repent and believe and do right, he haply may be one of the successful. S: But as to him who repents and believes and does good, maybe he will be among the successful: 028.068 Y: Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter): Glory to God! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)! P: Thy Lord bringeth to pass what He willeth and chooseth. They have never any choice. Glorified be God and Exalted above all that they associate (with Him)! S: And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases; to choose is not theirs; glory be to God, and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him). 028.069 Y: And thy Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal. P: And thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal, and what they publish. S: And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest. 028.070 Y: And He is God: There is no god but He. To Him be praise, at the first and at the last: for Him is the Command, and to Him"Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. 026.172 But the rest We destroyed utterly. 026.173 We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! 026.174 Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. 026.175 And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. 026.176 The Companions of the Wood rejected the messengers. 026.177 Behold, Shu'aib said to them: "Will ye not fear (God)?" 026.178 "I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust." 026.179 "So fear God and obey me." 026.180 "No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds." 026.181 "Give just measure, and cause no loss (to others by fraud)." 026.182 "And weigh with scales true and upright." 026.183 "And withhold not things justly due to men, nor do evil in the land, working mischief." 026.184 "And fear Him Who created you and (who created) the generations before (you)." 026.185 They said: "Thou art only one of those bewitched!" 026.186 "Thou art no more than a mortal like us, and indeed we think thou art a liar!" 026.187 "Now cause a piece of the sky to fall on us, if thou art truthful!" 026.188 He said: "My Lord knows best what ye do." 026.189 But they rejected him. Then the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them, and that was the Penalty of a Great Day. 026.190 Verily in that is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. 026.191 And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. 026.192 Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds: 026.193 With it came down the spirit of Faith and Truth- 026.194 To thy heart and mind, that thou mayest admonish. 026.195 In the perspicuous Arabic tongue. 026.196 Without doubt it is (announced) in the mystic Books of former peoples. 026.197 Is it not a Sign to them that the Learned of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)? 026.198 Had We revealed it to any of the non-Arabs, 026.199 And had he recited it to them, they would not have believed in it. 026.200 Thus have We caused it to enter the hearts of the sinners. 026.201 They will not believe in it until they see the grievous Penalty; 026.202 But the (Penalty) will come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it not; 026.203 Then they will say: "Shall we be respited?" 026.204 Do they then ask for Our Penalty to be hastened on? 026.205 Seest thou? If We do let them enjoy (this life) for a few years, 026.206 Yet there comes to them at length the (Punishment) which they were promised! 026.207 It will profit them not that they enjoyed (this life)! 026.208 Never did We destroy a population, but had its warners - 026.209 By way of reminder; and We never are unjust. 026.210 No evil ones have brought down this (Revelation): 026.211 It would neither suit them nor would they be able (to produce it). 026.212 Indeed they have been removed far from even (a chance of) hearing it. 026.213 So call not on any other god with God, or thou wilt be among those under the Penalty. 026.214 And admonish thy nearest kinsmen, 026.215 And lower thy wing to the Believers who follow thee. 026.216 Then if they disobey thee, say: "I am free (of responsibility) for what ye do!" 026.217 And put thy trust on the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,- 026.218 Who seeth thee standing forth (in prayer), 026.219 And thy movements among those who prostrate themselves, 026.220 For it is He Who heareth and knoweth all things. 026.221 Shall I inform you, (O people!), on whom it is that the evil ones descend? 026.222 They descend on every lying, wicked person, 026.223 (Into whose ears) they pour hearsay vanities, and most of them are liars. 026.224 And the Poets,- It is those straying in Evil, who follow them: 026.225 Seest thou not that they wander distracted in every valley?- 026.226 And that they say what they practise not?- 026.227 Except those who believe, work righteousness, engage much in the remembrance of God, and defend themselves only after they are unjustly attacked.justly attacked. And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take! Save those who believe and do good works, and remember God much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned! Except those who believe and do good and remember God much, and defend themselves after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back.

Chapter 27: AL-NAML (THE ANT, THE ANTS)
Total Verses: 93
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

027.001 These are verses of the Qur'an, a book that makes (things) clear;
027.002 A guide and glad tidings for the believers,
027.003 Those who establish regular prayers and give in regular charity, and also have (full) assurance of the hereafter.
027.004 As to those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds pleasing in their eyes; and so they wander about in distraction.
027.005 Such are they for whom a grievous Penalty is (waiting); and in the Hereafter theirs will be the greatest loss.
027.006 As to thee, the Qur'an is bestowed upon thee from the presence of one Who is Wise and All-Knowing.
027.007 Behold! Moses said to his family: "I perceive a fire; soon will I bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand to light our fuel, that ye may warm yourselves."
027.008 But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard: "Blessed are those in the fire and those around: and Glory to God, the Lord of the Worlds!"
027.009 "O Moses! verily, I am God, the Exalted in Might, the Wise!"
027.010 "Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: "O Moses!" (it was said), "Fear not: truly, in My presence, those called as messengers have no fear,"
027.011 "But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take the place of evil, truly, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
027.012 "Now put thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm): (these are) among the nine Signs (thou wilt take) to Pharaoh and his people: for they are a people rebellious in transgression."
027.013 But when Our Signs came to them, that should have opened their eyes, they said: "This is sorcery manifest!"
027.014 And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their souls were convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly!
027.015 We gave (in the past) knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said: "Praise be to God, Who has favoured us above many of his servants who believe!"
027.016 And Solomon was David's heir. He said: "O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds, and on us has been bestowed (a little) of all things: this is indeed Grace manifest (from God.)"
027.017 And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts, of jinns and men and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks.
027.018 At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said: "O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it."
027.019 So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: "O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants."
027.020 And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: "Why is it I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?"
027.021 "I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty, or execute him, unless he bring me a clear reason (for absence)."
027.022 But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: "I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true."
027.023 "I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne."
027.024 "I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides God: Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes, and has kept them away from the Path, so they receive no guidance,"
027.025 "(Kept them away from the Path), that they should not worship God, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what ye hide and what ye reveal.""that ye reveal." So that they worship not God, Who brings forth the hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you hide and what you make manifest:

027.026 "God! There is no god but He! Lord of the Throne Supreme!"

027.027 (Solomon) said: "Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!"

027.028 "Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw back from them, and (wait to) see what answer they return."

027.029 (The queen) said: "Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me a letter worthy of respect."

027.030 "It is from Solomon, and is (as follows): 'In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful:'"

027.031 "'Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission (to the true Religion).'"

027.032 She said: "Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided except in your presence."

027.033 They said: "We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command."

027.034 She said: "Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest of its people its meanest. Thus do they behave."

027.035 "But I am going to send him a present, and (wait) to see with what (answer) return (my) ambassadors."

027.036 Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon, he said: "Will ye give me abundance in wealth? But that which God has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!"

027.037 "Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace, and they will feel humbled (indeed)."

027.038 He said (to his own men): "Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"

027.039 Said an 'Ifrit, of the jinns: "I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may be trusted."

027.040 Said one who had knowledge of the Book: "I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord! To test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour!"

027.041 He said: "Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us see whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who receive no guidance."

027.042 So when she arrived, she was asked, "Is this thy throne?" She said, "It was just like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we have submitted to God (in Islam)."

027.043 And he diverted her from the worship of others besides God: for she was (sprung) of a people that had no faith.

027.044 She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought it was a lake of water, and she (tucked up her skirts), uncovering her legs. He said: "This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass." She said: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Islam), with Solomon, to the Lord of the Worlds."

027.045 We sent (aforetime), to the Thamud, their brother Salih, saying, "Serve God": But behold, they became two factions quarrelling with each other.

027.046 He said: "O my people! Why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to the good? If only ye ask God for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy."

027.047 They said: "Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee." He said: "Your ill omen is with God; yea, ye are a people under trial."

027.048 There were in the city nine men of a family, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform.

027.049 They said: "Swear a mutual oath by God that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir (when he seeks vengeance): 'We were not present at the slaughter of his people, and we are positively telling the truth shall ye (all) be brought back. P: And He is God; there is no God save Him. His is all praise in the former and the latter (state), and His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. S: And He is God, there is no god but He! All praise is due to Him in this (life) and the hereafter, and His is the judgment, and to Him you shall be brought back. 028.071 Y: Say: See ye? If God were to make the night perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than God, who can give you enlightenment? Will ye not then hearken? P: Say: Have ye thought, if God made night everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a god beside God who could bring you light? Will ye not then hear? S: Say: Tell me, if God were to make the night to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides God that could bring you light? Do you not then hear? 028.072 Y: Say: See ye? If God were to make the day perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than God, who can give you a night in which ye can rest? Will ye not then see? P: Say: Have ye thought, if God made day everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a god beside God who could bring you night wherein ye rest? Will ye not then see? S: Say: Tell me, if God were to make the day to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides God that could bring you the night in which you take rest? Do you not then see? 028.073 Y: It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day,- that ye may rest therein, and that ye may seek of his Grace;- and in order that ye may be grateful. P: Of His mercy hath He appointed for you night and day, that therein ye may rest, and that ye may seek His bounty, and that haply ye may be thankful. S: And out of His mercy He has made for you the night and the day, that you may rest therein, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks. 028.074 Y: The Day that He will call on them, He will say: "Where are my 'partners'? whom ye imagined (to be such)?" P: And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom ye pretended? S: And on the day when He shall call them and say: Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates? 028.075 Y: And from each people shall We draw a witness, and We shall say: "Produce your Proof": then shall they know that the Truth is in God (alone), and the (lies) which they invented will leave them in lurch. P: And We shall take out from every nation a witness and We shall say: Bring your proof. Then they will know that God hath the Truth, and all that they invented will have failed them. S: And We will draw forth from among every nation a witness and say: Bring your proof; then shall they know that the truth is God's, and that which they forged shall depart from them. 028.076 Y: Qarun was doubtless, of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards them: such were the treasures We had bestowed on him that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men, behold, his people said to him: "Exult not, for God loveth not those who exult (in riches)." P: Now Korah was of Moses' folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! God loveth not the exultant; S: Surely Qaroun was of the people of Musa, but he rebelled against them, and We had given him of the treasures, so much so that his hoards of wealth would certainly weigh down a company of men possessed of great strength. When his people said to him: Do not exult, surely God does not love the exultant; 028.077 Y: "But seek, with the (wealth) which God has bestowed on thee, the Home of the Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as God has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for God loves not those who do mischief." P: But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which God hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as God hath been kind to thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo! God loveth not corrupters, S: And seek by means of what God has given you the future abode, and do not neglect your portion of this world, and do good (to others) as God has done good to you, and do not seek to make mischief in the land, surely God does not love the mischief-makers. 028.078 Y: He said: "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have." Did he not know that God had destroyed, before him, (whole) generations,- which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected? but the wicked are not called (immediately) to account for their sins. P: He said: I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess. Knew he not that God had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following? The guilty are not questioned of their sins. S: He said: I have been given this only on account of the knowledge I have. Did he not know that God had destroyed before him of the generations those who were mightier in strength than he and greater in assemblage? And the guilty shall not be asked about their faults. 028.079 Y: So he went forth among his people in the (pride of his worldly) glitter. Said those whose aim is the Life of this World: "Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!" P: Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world said: Ah, would that we had the like of what hath been given unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune. S: So he went forth to his people in his finery. Those who desire this world's life said: O would that we had the like of what Qaroun is given; most surely he is possessed of mighty good fortune. 028.080 Y: But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: "Alas for you! The reward of God (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere (in good)." P: But those who had been given knowledge said: Woe unto you! The reward of God for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast will obtain it. S: And those who were given the knowledge said: Woe to you! God's reward is better for him who believes and does good, and none is made to receive this except the patient. 028.081 Y: Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not (the least little) party to help him against God, nor could he defend himself. P: So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling-place. Then he had no host to help him against God, nor was he of those who can save themselves. S: Thus We made the earth to swallow up him and his abode; so he had no body of helpers to assist him against God nor was he of those who can defend themselves. 028.082 Y: And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: "Ah! it is indeed God Who enlarges the provision or restricts it, to any of His servants He pleases! had it not been that God was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject God will assuredly never prosper." P: And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah, welladay! God enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straiteneth it (for whom He will). If God had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us (also). Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper. S: And those who yearned for his place only the day before began to say: Ah! (know) that God amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants; had not God been gracious to us, He would most surely have abased us; ah! (know) that the ungrateful are never successful. 028.083 Y: That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high-handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is (best) for the righteous. P: As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption. The sequel is for those who ward off (evil). S: (As for) that future abode, We assign it to those who have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make mischief and the good end is for those who guard (against evil) 028.084 Y: If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds. P: Whoso bringeth a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as for him who bringeth an ill-deed, those who do ill-deeds will be requited only what they did. S: Whoever brings good, he shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil, those who do evil shall not be rewarded (for) aught except what they did. 028.085 Y: Verily He Who ordained the Qur'an for thee, will bring thee back to the Place of Return. Say: "My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance, and who is in manifest error." P: Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur'an for a law will surely bring thee home again. Say: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest. S: Most surely He Who has made the Quran binding on you will bring you back to the destination. Say: My Lord knows best him who has brought the guidance and him who is in manifest error. 028.086 Y: And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject (God's Message). P: Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers. S: And you did not expect that the Book would be inspired to you, but it is a mercy from your Lord, therefore be not a backer-up of the unbelievers. 028.087 Y: And let nothing keep thee back from the Signs of God after they have been revealed to thee: and invite (men) to thy Lord, and be not of the company of those who join gods with God. P: And let them not divert thee from the revelations of God after they have been sent down unto thee; but call (mankind) unto thy Lord, and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto Him). S: And let them not turn you aside from the communications of God after they have been revealed to you, and call (men) to your Lord and be not of the polytheists. 028.088 Y: And call not, besides God, on another god. There is no god but He. Everything (that exists) will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye (all) be brought back. P: And cry not unto any other god along with God. There is no God save Him. Everything will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye (all) be brought back."ward we will surely say unto his friend: We witnessed not the destruction of his household. And lo! we are truthtellers. They said: Swear to each other by God that we will certainly make a sudden attack on him and his family by night, then we will say to his heir: We did not witness the destruction of his family, and we are most surely truthful.

027.050 They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived it not. So they plotted a plot: and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not. And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan while they perceived not.

027.051 Then see what was the end of their plot! We destroyed them and their people, all of them. Then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting, for lo! We destroyed them and their people, every one. See, then, how was the end of their plan that We destroyed them and their people, all of them.

027.052 Now such were their houses, in utter ruin, because they practiced wrongdoing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge. See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a people who have knowledge. So those are their houses fallen down because they were unjust, most surely there is a sign in this for a people who know.

027.053 And We saved those who believed and practiced righteousness. And we saved those who believed and used to ward off evil. And We delivered those who believed and who guarded against evil.

027.054 (We also sent) Lut (as a messenger): behold, He said to his people, "Do ye do what is shameful though ye see its iniquity?" And Lot! when he said unto his folk: Will ye commit abomination knowingly? And (We sent) Lut, when he said to his people: What! do you commit indecency while you see?

027.055 Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are a people grossly ignorant! Must ye seek lust after men instead of women? Nay, but ye are folk who act senselessly. What! do you indeed approach men lustfully rather than women? Nay, you are a people who act ignorantly.

027.056 But his people gave no other answer but this: they said, "Drive out the followers of Lut from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!" But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said: Expel the household of Lot from your township, for they (forsooth) are folk who would keep clean! But the answer of his people was no other except that they said: Turn out Lut's followers from your town; surely they are a people who would keep pure!

027.057 But We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lagged behind. Then We saved him and his household save his wife; We destined her to be of those who stayed behind. But We delivered him and his followers except his wife; We ordained her to be of those who remained behind.

027.058 And We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! And We rained a rain upon them. Dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned. And We rained on them a rain, and evil was the rain of those who had been warned.

027.059 Say: Praise be to God, and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen (for his Message). (Who) is better?- God or the false gods they associate (with Him)? Say (O Muhammad): Praise be to God, and peace be on His slaves whom He hath chosen! Is God best, or (all) that ye ascribe as partners (unto Him)? Say: Praise be to God and peace on His servants whom He has chosen: is God better, or what they associate (with Him)?

027.060 Or, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who sends you down rain from the sky? Yea, with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full of beauty of delight: it is not in your power to cause the growth of the trees in them. (Can there be another) god besides God? Nay, they are a people who swerve from justice. Is not He (best) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down for you water from the sky wherewith We cause to spring forth joyous orchards, whose trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow. Is there any God beside God? Nay, but they are folk who ascribe equals (unto Him)! Nay, He Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down for you water from the cloud; then We cause to grow thereby beautiful gardens; it is not possible for you that you should make the trees thereof to grow. Is there a god with God? Nay! they are people who deviate.

027.061 Or, Who has made the earth firm to live in; made rivers in its midst; set thereon mountains immovable; and made a separating bar between the two bodies of flowing water? (can there be another) god besides God? Nay, most of them know not. Is not He (best) Who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in the folds thereof, and placed firm hills therein, and hath set a barrier between the two seas? Is there any God beside God? Nay, but most of them know not! Or, Who made the earth a resting place, and made in it rivers, and raised on it mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier. Is there a god with God? Nay! most of them do not know!

027.062 Or, Who listens to the (soul) distressed when it calls on Him, and Who relieves its suffering, and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there be another) god besides God? Little it is that ye heed! Is not He (best) Who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto Him and removeth the evil, and hath made you viceroys of the earth? Is there any God beside God? Little do they reflect! Or, Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and removes the evil, and He will make you successors in the earth. Is there a god with God? Little is it that you mind!

027.063 Or, Who guides you through the depths of darkness on land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy? (Can there be another) god besides God?- High is God above what they associate with Him! Is not He (best) Who guideth you in the darkness of the land and the sea, He Who sendeth the winds as heralds of His mercy? Is there any God beside God? High Exalted be God from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! Or, Who guides you in utter darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy. Is there a god with God? Exalted by God above what they associate (with Him).

027.064 Or, Who originates creation, then repeats it, and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? (Can there be another) god besides God? Say, "Bring forth your argument, if ye are telling the truth!" Is not He (best) Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and Who provideth for you from the heaven and the earth? Is there any God beside God? Say: Bring your proof, if ye are truthful! Or, Who originates the creation, then reproduces it and Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth. Is there a god With God? Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful.

027.065 Say: None in the heavens or on earth, except God, knows what is hidden: nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up (for Judgment). Say (O Muhammad): None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the Unseen save God; and they know not when they will be raised (again). Say: No one in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen but God; and they do not know when they shall be raised.

027.066 Still less can their knowledge comprehend the Hereafter: Nay, they are in doubt and uncertainty thereanent; nay, they are blind thereunto! Nay, but doth their knowledge reach to the Hereafter? Nay, for they are in doubt concerning it. Nay, for they cannot see it. Nay, their knowledge respecting the hereafter is slight and hasty; nay, they are in doubt about it; nay, they are quite blind to it.

027.067 The Unbelievers say: "What! when we become dust,- we and our fathers,- shall we really be raised (from the dead)?" Yet those who disbelieve say: When we have become dust like our fathers, shall we verily be brought forth (again)? And those who disbelieve say: What! when we have become dust and our fathers (too), shall we certainly be brought forth?

027.068 "It is true we were promised this,- we and our fathers before (us): these are nothing but tales of the ancients." We were promised this, forsooth, we and our fathers. (All) this is naught but fables of the men of old. We have certainly been promised this, we and our fathers before; these are naught but stories of the ancients.

027.069 Say: "Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty (of sin)." Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see the nature of the sequel for the guilty! Say: Travel in the earth, then see how was the end of the guilty.

027.070 But grieve not over them, nor distress thyself because of their plots. And grieve thou not for them, nor be in distress because of what they plot (against thee). And grieve not for them and be not distressed because of what they plan.

027.071 They also say: "When will this promise (come to pass)? (Say) if ye are truthful." And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful? And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?

027.072 Say: "It may be that some of the events which ye wish to hasten on may be (close) in your pursuit!" Say: It may be that a part of that which ye would hasten on is close behind you. Say: Maybe there may have drawn near to you somewhat of that which you seek to hasten on.

027.073 But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them are ungrateful. Lo! thy Lord is full of bounty for mankind, but most of them do not give thanks. And surely your Lord is the Lord of grace to men, but most of them are not grateful.

027.074 And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide. As well as all that they reveal. Lo! thy Lord knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide, and all that they proclaim. And most surely your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest.

027.075 Nor is there aught of the unseen, in heaven or earth, but is (recorded) in a clear record. And there is nothing hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in a clear Record. And there is nothing concealed in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear book.

027.076 Verily this Qur'an doth explain to the Children of Israel most of the matters in which they disagree. Lo! this Qur'an narrateth unto the Children of Israel most of that concerning which they differ. Surely this Quran declares to the children of Israel most of what they differ in.

027.077 And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believe. And lo! it is a guidance and Mercy for believers. And most surely it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers.

027.078 Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree: and He is Exalted in Might, All-Knowing. Surely your Lord will judge between them by His judgment, and He is the Mighty, the Knowing.

027.079 So put thy trust in God: for thou art on the path of manifest Truth. Therefore rely on God; surely you are on the clear truth.

027.080 Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen, nor canst thou cause the deaf to hear the call, especially when they turn back in retreat. Surely you do not make the dead to hear, and you do not make the deaf to hear the call when they go back retreating.

027.081 Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind, to prevent them from straying: only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs, and they will bow in Islam. Nor can you be a guide to the blind out of their error; you cannot make to hear except those who believe in Our communications, so they submit.

027.082 And when the Word is fulfilled against them, we shall produce from the earth a beast to face them: He will speak to them, for mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs. And when the word shall come to pass against them, We shall bring forth for them a creature from the earth that shall wound them, because people did not believe in Our communications.

027.083 One day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those who reject our Signs, and they shall be kept in ranks. And on the day when We will gather from every nation a party from among those who rejected Our communications, then they shall be formed into groups.

027.084 Until, when they come before the Judgment-seat, God will say: "Did ye reject My Signs, though ye comprehended them not in knowledge, or what was it ye did?" Until when they come, He will say: Did you reject My communications while you had no comprehensive knowledge of them? Or what was it that you did?

027.085 And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because of their wrong-doing, and they will be unable to speak in plea. And the word shall come to pass against them because they were unjust, so they shall not speak.

027.086 See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day to give them light? Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe! Do they not consider that We have made the night that they may rest therein, and the day to give light? Most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.

027.087 And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten with terror those who are in the heavens, and those who are on earth, except such as God will please to exempt: and all shall come to His Presence as beings conscious of their lowliness. And on the day when the trumpet shall be blown, then those who are in the heavens and those who are in the earth shall be terrified except such as God please, and all shall come to Him abased.

027.088 Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: such is the artistry of God, who disposes of all things in perfect order: for He is well acquainted with all that ye do. And you see the mountains, you think them to be solid, and they shall pass away as the passing away of the cloud the handiwork of God Who has made everything thoroughly; surely He is Aware of what you do.

027.089 If any do good, good will accrue to them therefrom; and they will be secure from terror that Day. Whoever brings good, he shall have better than it; and they shall be secure from terror on the day.

027.090 And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire: "Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?" And whoever brings evil, these shall be thrown down on their faces into the fire; shall you be rewarded for aught except what you did?

027.091 For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city, Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom belong all things: and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Islam to God's Will. I am commanded only that I should serve the Lord of this city, Who has made it sacred, and His are all things; and I am commanded that I should be of those who submit.

027.092 And to rehearse the Qur'an: and if any accept guidance, they do it for the good of their own souls, and if any stray, say: "I am only a Warner." And that I should recite the Quran. Therefore whoever goes aright, he goes aright for his own soul, and whoever goes astray, then say: I am only one of the warners.

027.093 And say: "Praise be to God, Who will soon show you His Signs, so that ye shall know them"; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do. And say: Praise be to God, He will show you His signs so that you shall recognize them; nor is your Lord heedless of what you do.

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

028.001 Ta. Sin. Mim.

028.002 These are Verses of the Book that makes things clear.

028.003 We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth, for people who believe.

028.004 Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections, depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew, but he kept alive their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief.

028.005 And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders in Faith and make them heirs,

028.006 To establish a firm place for them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Haman, and their hosts, at their hands, the very things against which they were taking precautions.

028.007 So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: "Suckle thy child, but when thou hast fears about him, cast him into the river, but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one of Our messengers."

028.008 Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up from the river: It was intended that Moses should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaoh and Haman and all their hosts were men of sin.

028.009 The wife of Pharaoh said: "Here is joy of the eye, for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not what they were doing. Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!" P: Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world said: Ah, would that we had the like of what hath been given unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune. S: So he went forth to his people in his finery. Those who desire this world's life said: O would that we had the like of what Qaroun is given; most surely he is possessed of mighty good fortune. 028.080 Y: But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: "Alas for you! The reward of God (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere (in good)." P: But those who had been given knowledge said: Woe unto you! The reward of God for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast will obtain it. S: And those who were given the knowledge said: Woe to you! God's reward is better for him who believes and does good, and none is made to receive this except the patient. 028.081 Y: Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not (the least little) party to help him against God, nor could he defend himself. P: So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling-place. Then he had no host to help him against God, nor was he of those who can save themselves. S: Thus We made the earth to swallow up him and his abode; so he had no body of helpers to assist him against God nor was he of those who can defend themselves. 028.082 Y: And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: "Ah! it is indeed God Who enlarges the provision or restricts it, to any of His servants He pleases! had it not been that God was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject God will assuredly never prosper." P: And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah, welladay! God enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straiteneth it (for whom He will). If God had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us (also). Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper. S: And those who yearned for his place only the day before began to say: Ah! (know) that God amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants; had not God been gracious to us, He would most surely have abased us; ah! (know) that the ungrateful are never successful. 028.083 Y: That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high-handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is (best) for the righteous. P: As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption. The sequel is for those who ward off (evil). S: (As for) that future abode, We assign it to those who have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make mischief and the good end is for those who guard (against evil) 028.084 Y: If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds. P: Whoso bringeth a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as for him who bringeth an ill-deed, those who do ill-deeds will be requited only what they did. S: Whoever brings good, he shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil, those who do evil shall not be rewarded (for) aught except what they did. 028.085 Y: Verily He Who ordained the Qur'an for thee, will bring thee back to the Place of Return. Say: "My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance, and who is in manifest error." P: Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur'an for a law will surely bring thee home again. Say: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest. S: Most surely He Who has made the Quran binding on you will bring you back to the destination. Say: My Lord knows best him who has brought the guidance and him who is in manifest error. 028.086 Y: And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject (God's Message). P: Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers. S: And you did not expect that the Book would be inspired to you, but it is a mercy from your Lord, therefore be not a backer-up of the unbelievers. 028.087 Y: And let nothing keep thee back from the Signs of God after they have been revealed to thee: and invite (men) to thy Lord, and be not of the company of those who join gods with God. P: And let them not divert thee from the revelations of God after they have been sent down unto thee; but call (mankind) unto thy Lord, and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto Him). S: And let them not turn you aside from the communications of God after they have been revealed to you, and call (men) to your Lord and be not of the polytheists. 028.088 Y: And call not, besides God, on another god. There is no god but He. Everything (that exists) will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye (all) be brought back. P: And cry not unto any other god along with God. There is no God save Him. Everything will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye (all) be brought back."

ish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. S: And call not with God any other god; there is no god but He, every thing is perishable but He; His is the judgment, and to Him you shall be brought back. - Chapter 29: AL-ANKABOOT (THE SPIDER) Total Verses: 69 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 029.001 Y: A.L.M. P: Alif. Lam. Mim. S: Alif Lam Mim. 029.002 Y: Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, "We believe", and that they will not be tested? P: Do men imagine that they will be left (at ease) because they say, We believe, and will not be tested with affliction? S: Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and not be tried? 029.003 Y: We did test those before them, and God will certainly know those who are true from those who are false. P: Lo! We tested those who were before you. Thus God knoweth those who are sincere, and knoweth those who feign. S: And certainly We tried those before them, so God will certainly know those who are true and He will certainly know the liars. 029.004 Y: Do those who practise evil think that they will get the better of Us? Evil is their judgment! P: Or do those who do ill-deeds imagine that they can outstrip Us? Evil (for them) is that which they decide. S: Or do they who work evil think that they will escape Us? Evil is it that they judge! 029.005 Y: For those whose hopes are in the meeting with God (in the Hereafter, let them strive); for the term (appointed) by God is surely coming and He hears and knows (all things). P: Whoso looketh forward to the meeting with God (let him know that) God's reckoning is surely nigh, and He is the Hearer, the Knower. S: Whoever hopes to meet God, the term appointed by God will then most surely come; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 029.006 Y: And if any strive (with might and main), they do so for their own souls: for God is free of all needs from all creation. P: And whosoever striveth, striveth only for himself, for lo! God is altogether Independent of (His) creatures. S: And whoever strives hard, he strives only for his own soul; most surely God is Self-sufficient, above (need of) the worlds. 029.007 Y: Those who believe and work righteous deeds,- from them shall We blot out all evil (that may be) in them, and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds. P: And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall remit from them their evil deeds and shall repay them the best that they did. S: And (as for) those who believe and do good, We will most certainly do away with their evil deeds and We will most certainly reward them the best of what they did. 029.008 Y: We have enjoined on man kindness to parents: but if they (either of them) strive (to force) thee to join with Me (in worship) anything of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not. Ye have (all) to return to me, and I will tell you (the truth) of all that ye did. P: We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive to make thee join with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what ye used to do. S: And We have enjoined on man goodness to his parents, and if they contend with you that you should associate (others) with Me, of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them, to Me is your return, so I will inform you of what you did. 029.009 Y: And those who believe and work righteous deeds,- them shall We admit to the company of the Righteous. P: And as for those who believe and do good works, We verily shall make them enter in among the righteous. S: And (as for) those who believe and do good, We will most surely cause them to enter among the good. 029.010 Y: Then there are among men such as say, "We believe in God"; but when they suffer affliction in (the cause of) God, they treat men's oppression as if it were the Wrath of God! And if help comes (to thee) from thy Lord, they are sure to say, "We have (always) been with you!" Does not God know best all that is in the hearts of all creation? P: Of mankind is he who saith: We believe in God, but, if he be made to suffer for the sake of God, he mistaketh the persecution of mankind for God's punishment; and then, if victory cometh from thy Lord, will say: Lo! we were with you (all the while). Is not God Best Aware of what is in the bosoms of (His) creatures? S: And among men is he who says: We believe in God; but when he is persecuted in (the way of) God he thinks the persecution of men to be as the chastisement of God; and if there come assistance from your Lord, they would most certainly say: Surely we were with you. What! is not God the best knower of what is in the breasts of mankind. 029.011 Y: And God most certainly knows those who believe, and as certainly those who are Hypocrites. P: Verily God knoweth those who believe, and verily He knoweth the hypocrites. S: And most certainly God will know those who believe and most certainly He will know the hypocrites. 029.012 Y: And the Unbelievers say to those who believe: "Follow our path, and we will bear (the consequences) of your faults." Never in the least will they bear their faults: in fact they are liars! P: Those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Follow our way (of religion) and we verily will bear your sins (for you). They cannot bear aught of their sins. Lo! they verily are liars. S: And those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Follow our path and we will bear your wrongs. And never shall they be the bearers of any of their wrongs; most surely they are liars. 029.013 Y: They will bear their own burdens, and (other) burdens along with their own, and on the Day of Judgments they will be called to account for their falsehoods. P: But they verily will bear their own loads and other loads beside their own, and they verily will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they invented. S: And most certainly they shall carry their own burdens, and other burdens with their own burdens, and most certainly they shall be questioned on the resurrection day as to what they forged. 029.014 Y: We (once) sent Noah to his people, and he tarried among them a thousand years less fifty: but the Deluge overwhelmed them while they (persisted in) sin. P: And verily we sent Noah (as Our messenger) unto his folk, and he continued with them for a thousand years save fifty years; and the flood engulfed them, for they were wrong-doers. S: And certainly We sent Nuh to his people, so he remained among them a thousand years save fifty years. And the deluge overtook them, while they were unjust. 029.015 Y: But We saved him and the companions of the Ark, and We made the (Ark) a Sign for all peoples! P: And We rescued him and those with him in the ship, and made of it a portent for the peoples. S: So We delivered him and the inmates of the ark, and made it a sign to the nations. 029.016 Y: And (We also saved) Abraham: behold, he said to his people, "Serve God and fear Him: that will be best for you- if ye understand!" P: And Abraham! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Serve God, and keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if ye did but know. S: And (We sent) Ibrahim, when he said to his people: Serve God and be careful of (your duty to) Him; this is best for you, if you did but know: 029.017 Y: "For ye do worship idols besides God, and ye invent falsehood. The things that ye worship besides God have no power to give you sustenance: then seek ye sustenance from God, serve Him, and be grateful to Him: to Him will be your return." P: Ye serve instead of God only idols, and ye only invent a lie. Lo! those whom ye serve instead of God own no provision for you. So seek your provision from God, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, (for) unto Him ye will be brought back. S: You only worship idols besides God and you create a lie surely they whom you serve besides God do not control for you any sustenance, therefore seek the sustenance from God and serve Him and be grateful to Him; to Him you shall be brought back. 029.018 Y: "And if ye reject (the Message), so did generations before you: and the duty of the messenger is only to preach publicly (and clearly)." P: But if ye deny, then nations have denied before you. The messenger is only to convey (the message) plainly. S: And if you reject (the truth), nations before you did indeed reject (the truth); and nothing is incumbent on the messenger but a plain delivering (of the message). 029.019 Y: See they not how God originates creation, then repeats it: truly that is easy for God. P: See they not how God produceth creation, then reproduceth it? Lo! for God that is easy. S: What! do they not consider how God originates the creation, then reproduces it? Surely that is easy to God. 029.020 Y: Say: "Travel through the earth and see how God did originate creation; so will God produce a later creation: for God has power over all things." P: Say (O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see how He originated creation, then God bringeth forth the later growth. Lo! God is Able to do all things. S: Say: Travel in the earth and see how He makes the first creation, then God creates the latter creation; surely God has power over all things. 029.021 Y: "He punishes whom He pleases, and He grants Mercy to whom He pleases, and towards Him are ye turned." P: He punisheth whom He will and showeth mercy unto whom He will, and unto Him ye will be turned. S: He punishes whom He pleases and has mercy on whom He pleases, and to Him you shall be turned back. 029.022 Y: "Not on earth nor in heaven will ye be able (fleeing) to frustrate (his Plan), nor have ye, besides God, any protector or helper." P: Ye cannot escape (from Him) in the earth or in the sky, and beside God there is for you no friend or helper. S: And you shall not escape in the earth nor in the heaven, and you have neither a protector nor a helper besides God. 029.023 Y: Those who reject the Signs of God and the Meeting with Him (in the Hereafter),- it is they who shall despair of My Mercy: it is they who will (suffer) a most grievous Penalty. P: Those who disbelieve in the revelations of God and in (their) Meeting with Him, such have no hope of My mercy. For such there is a painful doom. S: And (as to) those who disbelieve in the communications of God and His meeting, they have despaired of My mercy, and these it is that shall have a painful punishment. 029.024 Y: So naught was the answer of (Abraham's) people except that they said: "Slay him or burn him." But God did save him from the Fire. Verily in this are Signs for people who believe. P: But the answer of his folk was only that they said: "Kill him" or "Burn him." Then God saved him from the Fire. Lo! herein verily are portents for folk who believe. S:And Pharaoh's wife said: "A refreshment of the eye to me and to you; do not slay him; maybe he will be useful to us, or we may take him for a son." And they did not perceive.

028.010 But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was going almost to disclose his case, had We not strengthened her heart with faith, so that she might remain a firm believer.

028.011 And she said to the sister of Moses, "Follow him." So she watched him in the character of a stranger. And they knew not.

028.012 And We ordained that he refused suck at first, until his sister said, "Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him?"

028.013 Thus did We restore him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of God is true. But most of them do not understand.

028.014 When he reached full age and was firmly established in life, We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge. For thus do We reward those who do good.

028.015 And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching, and he found there two men fighting, one of his own religion and the other of his foes. Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe, and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said, "This is a work of Satan, for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads."

028.016 He prayed, "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me!" So God forgave him, for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

028.017 He said, "O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, never shall I be a help to those who sin!"

028.018 So he saw the morning in the city, looking about in a state of fear, when behold, the man who had sought his help the day before called aloud for his help again. Moses said to him, "Thou art truly, it is clear, a quarrelsome fellow!"

028.019 Then, when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them, that man said, "O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday? Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent man in the land, and not to be one who sets things right!"

028.020 And there came a man, running, from the furthest end of the city. He said, "O Moses! The chiefs are taking counsel together about thee, to slay thee. So get thee away, for I do give thee sincere advice."

028.021 He therefore got away therefrom, looking about in a state of fear. He prayed, "O my Lord! Save me from people given to wrong-doing."

028.022 Then, when he turned his face towards the land of Madyan, he said, "I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path."

028.023 And when he arrived at the watering place in Madyan, he found there a group of men watering their flocks, and besides them, he found two women who were keeping back their flocks. He said, "What is the matter with you?" They said, "We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take back their flocks, and our father is a very old man."

028.024 So he watered their flocks for them, then he turned back to the shade and said, "O my Lord! Truly am I in desperate need of any good that Thou dost send me!"

028.025 Afterwards, one of the damsels came back to him, walking bashfully. She said, "My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered our flocks for us." So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said, "Fear thou not. Well hast thou escaped from unjust people."

028.026 Said one of the damsels, "O my dear father! Engage him on wages. Truly the best of men for thee to employ is the man who is strong and trusty."

028.027 He said, "I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee, on condition that thou serve me for eight years. But if thou complete ten years, it will be grace from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty. Thou wilt find me, indeed, if God wills, one of the righteous."

028.028 He said, "Be that the agreement between me and thee."He said: "This shall be an agreement between me and you; whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and God is a witness of what we say."

028.029 When Moses had fulfilled the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: "Wait here; I perceive a fire; maybe I will bring you some information or a burning firebrand, so you may warm yourselves."

028.030 But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in hallowed ground: "O Moses! Verily I am God, the Lord of the Worlds."

028.031 "Now throw your rod!" But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned back in retreat. "O Moses! Draw near and fear not: for you are of those who are secure."

028.032 "Move your hand into your bosom, and it will come forth white without harm. These are two credentials from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs: for they are a rebellious people."

028.033 He said: "O my Lord! I have slain a man among them, and I fear they will slay me."

028.034 "And my brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper, to confirm me: for I fear they may accuse me of falsehood."

028.035 He said: "We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both authority, so they shall not be able to touch you: with Our signs, you two and those who follow you will triumph."

028.036 When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said: "This is nothing but sorcery faked up: we never heard the like among our fathers of old!"

028.037 Moses said: "My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter: wrong-doers will not prosper."

028.038 Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs! I know no god for you but myself: therefore, O Haman! light me a kiln to bake bricks out of clay, and build me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but I think Moses is a liar!"

028.039 He and his hosts were arrogant in the land without right, and thought they would not have to return to Us.

028.040 So We seized him and his hosts, and flung them into the sea: behold the end of those who did wrong!

028.041 We made them leaders inviting to the Fire; and on the Day of Judgment, no help shall they find.

028.042 In this world, We made a curse to follow them, and on the Day of Judgment, they will be among the loathed.

028.043 We revealed to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations, to give insight to men, guidance, and mercy, that they might receive admonition.

028.044 You were not on the Western side when We decreed the commission to Moses, nor were you a witness of those events.

028.045 But We raised up new generations, and long were the ages that passed over them; you were not a dweller among the people of Madyan, rehearsing Our signs to them; but it is We Who send messengers.

028.046 Nor were you at the side of Mount Tur when We called to Moses. Yet you are sent as a mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you, so they may receive admonition.

028.047 If We had not sent you to the Quraish, in case a calamity should seize them for their deeds, they might say: "Our Lord! Why did You not send us a messenger? We should then have followed Your signs and been among those who believe!"

028.048 But now, when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, "Why are not signs sent to him like those which were sent to Moses?" Do they not then reject..."except that they said: Slay him or burn him; then God delivered him from the fire; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe. 029.025 Y: And he said: 'For you, ye have taken (for worship) idols besides God, out of mutual love and regard between yourselves in this life; but on the Day of Judgment ye shall disown each other and curse each other: and your abode will be the Fire, and ye shall have none to help.' P: He said: Ye have chosen only idols instead of God. The love between you is only in the life of the world. Then on the Day of Resurrection ye will deny each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and ye will have no helpers. S: And he said: You have only taken for yourselves idols besides God by way of friendship between you in this world's life, then on the resurrection day some of you shall deny others, and some of you shall curse others, and your abode is the fire, and you shall not have any helpers. 029.026 Y: But Lut had faith in Him: He said: 'I will leave home for the sake of my Lord: for He is Exalted in Might, and Wise.' P: And Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive unto my Lord. Lo! He, only He, is the Mighty, the Wise. S: And Lut believed in Him, and he said: I am fleeing to my Lord, surely He is the Mighty, the Wise. 029.027 Y: And We gave (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation, and We granted him his reward in this life; and he was in the Hereafter (of the company) of the Righteous. P: And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and We established the prophethood and the Scripture among his seed, and We gave him his reward in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he verily is among the righteous. S: And We granted him Ishaq and Yaqoub, and caused the prophethood and the book to remain in his seed, and We gave him his reward in this world, and in the hereafter he will most surely be among the good. 029.028 Y: And (remember) Lut: behold, he said to his people: 'Ye do commit lewdness, such as no people in Creation (ever) committed before you.' P: And Lot! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Lo! ye commit lewdness such as no creature did before you. S: And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people: Most surely you are guilty of an indecency which none of the nations has ever done before you; 029.029 Y: 'Do ye indeed approach men, and cut off the highway?- and practise wickedness (even) in your councils?' But his people gave no answer but this: they said: 'Bring us the Wrath of God if thou tellest the truth.' P: For come ye not in unto males, and cut ye not the road (for travellers), and commit ye not abomination in your meetings? But the answer of his folk was only that they said: Bring God's doom upon us if thou art a truthteller! S: What! do you come to the males and commit robbery on the highway, and you commit evil deeds in your assemblies? But nothing was the answer of his people except that they said: Bring on us God's punishment, if you are one of the truthful. 029.030 Y: He said: 'O my Lord! help Thou me against people who do mischief!' P: He said: My Lord! Give me victory over folk who work corruption. S: He said: My Lord! help me against the mischievous people. 029.031 Y: When Our Messengers came to Abraham with the good news, they said: 'We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township: for truly they are (addicted to) crime.' P: And when Our messengers brought Abraham the good news, they said: Lo! we are about to destroy the people of that township, for its people are wrong-doers. S: And when Our messengers came to Ibrahim with the good news, they said: Surely we are going to destroy the people of this town, for its people are unjust. 029.032 Y: He said: 'But there is Lut there.' They said: 'Well do we know who is there: we will certainly save him and his following,- except his wife: she is of those who lag behind!' P: He said: Lo! Lot is there. They said: We are best aware of who is there. We are to deliver him and his household, all save his wife, who is of those who stay behind. S: He said: Surely in it is Lut. They said: We know well who is in it; we shall certainly deliver him and his followers, except his wife; she shall be of those who remain behind. 029.033 Y: And when Our Messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account, and felt himself powerless (to protect) them: but they said: 'Fear thou not, nor grieve: we are (here) to save thee and thy following, except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind.' P: And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled upon their account, for he could not protect them; but they said: Fear not, nor grieve! Lo! we are to deliver thee and thy household, (all) save thy wife, who is of those who stay behind. S: And when Our messengers came to Lut he was grieved on account of them, and he felt powerless (to protect) them; and they said: Fear not, nor grieve; surely we will deliver you and your followers, except your wife; she shall be of those who remain behind. 029.034 Y: 'For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a Punishment from heaven, because they have been wickedly rebellious.' P: Lo! We are about to bring down upon the folk of this township a fury from the sky because they are evil-livers. S: Surely We will cause to come down upon the people of this town a punishment from heaven, because they transgressed. 029.035 Y: And We have left thereof an evident Sign, for any people who (care to) understand. P: And verily of that We have left a clear sign for people who have sense. S: And certainly We have left a clear sign of it for a people who understand. 029.036 Y: To the Madyan (people) (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. Then he said: 'O my people! serve God, and fear the Last Day: nor commit evil on the earth, with intent to do mischief.' P: And unto Midian We sent Shu'eyb, their brother. He said: O my people! Serve God, and look forward to the Last Day, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth. S: And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shuaib, so he said: O my people! serve God and fear the latter day and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief. 029.037 Y: But they rejected him: Then the mighty Blast seized them, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning. P: But they denied him, and the dreadful earthquake took them, and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling place. S: But they rejected him, so a severe earthquake overtook them, and they became motionless bodies in their abode. 029.038 Y: (Remember also) the 'Ad and the Thamud (people): clearly will appear to you from (the traces) of their buildings (their fate): the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them, and kept them back from the Path, though they were gifted with intelligence and skill. P: And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud! (Their fate) is manifest unto you from their (ruined and deserted) dwellings. Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and so debarred them from the Way, though they were keen observers. S: And (We destroyed) Ad and Samood, and from their dwellings (this) is apparent to you indeed; and the Shaitan made their deeds fair-seeming to them, so he kept them back from the path, though they were endowed with intelligence and skill, 029.039 Y: (Remember also) Qarun, Pharaoh, and Haman: there came to them Moses with Clear Signs, but they behaved with insolence on the earth; yet they could not overreach (Us). P: And Korah, Pharaoh and Haman! Moses came unto them with clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty), but they were boastful in the land. And they were not winners (in the race). S: And (We destroyed) Qaroun and Firon and Haman; and certainly Musa came to them with clear arguments, but they behaved haughtily in the land; yet they could not outstrip (Us). 029.040 Y: Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them, against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters): It was not God Who injured (or oppressed) them: They injured (and oppressed) their own souls. P: So We took each one in his sin; of them was he on whom We sent a hurricane, and of them was he who was overtaken by the (Awful) Cry, and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them was he whom We drowned. It was not for God to wrong them, but they wronged themselves. S: So each We punished for his sin; of them was he on whom We sent down a violent storm, and of them was he whom the rumbling overtook, and of them was he whom We made to be swallowed up by the earth, and of them was he whom We drowned; and it did not beseem God that He should be unjust to them, but they were unjust to their own souls. 029.041 Y: The parable of those who take protectors other than God is that of the spider, who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider's house;- if they but knew. P: The likeness of those who choose other patrons than God is as the likeness of the spider when she taketh unto herself a house, and lo! the frailest of all houses is the spider's house, if they but knew. S: The parable of those who take guardians besides God is as the parable of the spider that makes for itself a house; and most surely the frailest of the houses is the spider's house did they but know. 029.042 Y: Verily God doth know of (every thing) whatever that they call upon besides Him: and He is Exalted (in power), Wise. P: Lo! God knoweth what thing they invoke instead of Him. He is the Mighty, the Wise. S: Surely God knows whatever thing they call upon besides Him; and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 029.043 Y: And such are the Parables We set forth for mankind, but only those understand them who have knowledge. P: As for these similitudes, We coin them for mankind, but none will grasp their meaning save the wise. S: And (as for) these examples, We set them forth for men, and none understand them but the learned. 029.044 Y: God created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): verily in that is a Sign for those who believe. P: God created the heavens and the earth with truth. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers. S: God created the heavens and the earth with truth; most surely there is a sign in this for the believers. 029.045 Y: Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of God is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. And God knows the (deeds) that ye do. P: Recite that which hath been inspired in thee of the Scripture, and establish worship. Lo! worship preserveth from lewdness and iniquity, but verily remembrance of God is more important. And God knoweth what ye do. S: Recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book and keep up prayer; surely prayer keeps (one) away from indecency and evil, and certainly the remembrance of God is the greatest. And God knows what you do.""(the Signs) which were formerly sent to Moses? They say: 'Two kinds of sorcery, each assisting the other!' And they say: 'For us, we reject all (such things)!' But when the Truth came to them from Our presence, they said: 'Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?' Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses of old? They say: 'Two magics that support each other; and we disbelieve in both.' 

Say: 'Then bring a Book from God, which is a better guide than either of them, that I may follow it! (Do), if you are truthful!' But if they do not listen to you, know that they only follow their own desires: and who is more astray than one who follows his own desires, devoid of guidance from God? For God does not guide people given to wrongdoing.

Now We have caused the Word to reach them, so they may receive admonition. Those to whom We sent the Book before this, they believe in this (revelation). And when it is recited to them, they say: 'We believe in it, for it is the Truth from our Lord: indeed we have been Muslims (bowing to God's Will) from before this.' They will be given their reward twice, for they have persevered, averted evil with good, and spent (in charity) out of what We have given them.

And when they hear vain talk, they turn away and say: 'To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant.' It is true you will not be able to guide everyone you love; but God guides those whom He wills and He knows best those who receive guidance.

They say: 'If we were to follow the guidance with you, we should be snatched away from our land.' Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary, to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves? But most of them do not understand.

And how many populations We destroyed, which exulted in their life (of ease and plenty)! Now those habitations of theirs, after them, are deserted, except for a few! And We are their heirs. Nor was your Lord the one to destroy a population until He had sent to its center a messenger, rehearsing to them Our Signs; nor are We going to destroy a population except when its members practice iniquity.

The material things you are given are but the conveniences of this life and its glitter; but what is with God is better and more enduring: will you not then be wise? Are these two alike: one to whom We have made a goodly promise, and who is going to reach its fulfillment, and one to whom We have given the good things of this life, but who, on the Day of Judgment, is to be among those brought up (for punishment)?

That Day God will call to them, and say: 'Where are My partners whom you imagined (to be such)?' Those against whom the charge will be proved will say: 'Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray: we led them astray, as we were astray ourselves: we free ourselves (from them) in Your presence: it was not us they worshipped.' It will be said to them: 'Call upon your partners (for help)': they will call upon them, but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Penalty before them; (how they will wish) 'if only they had been open to guidance!'

That Day God will call to them, and say: 'What was the answer you gave to the messengers?' Then the whole story that Day will seem obscure to them and they will not be able to question each other. But any that had repented, believed, and worked righteousness, will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation.

Your Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter): Glory to God! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)! And your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal. And He is God: There is no god but He. To Him be praise, at the first and at the last: for Him is the Command, and to Him is the return."shall ye (all) be brought back. And He is God; there is no God save Him. His is all praise in the former and the latter state, and His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back.

Say: See ye? If God were to make the night perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than God, who can give you enlightenment? Will ye not then hearken? Say: Have ye thought, if God made night everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a god beside God who could bring you light? Will ye not then hear?

Say: Tell me, if God were to make the night to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides God that could bring you light? Do you not then hear?

Say: See ye? If God were to make the day perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than God, who can give you a night in which ye can rest? Will ye not then see? Say: Have ye thought, if God made day everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a god beside God who could bring you night wherein ye rest? Will ye not then see?

Say: Tell me, if God were to make the day to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides God that could bring you the night in which you take rest? Do you not then see?

It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day, that ye may rest therein, and that ye may seek of his Grace; and in order that ye may be grateful. Of His mercy hath He appointed for you night and day, that therein ye may rest, and that ye may seek His bounty, and that haply ye may be thankful.

And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom ye pretended? And We shall take out from every nation a witness and We shall say: Bring your proof. Then they will know that God hath the Truth, and all that they invented will have failed them.

Qarun was doubtless, of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards them: such were the treasures We had bestowed on him that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men, behold, his people said to him: Exult not, for God loveth not those who exult (in riches).

But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which God hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as God hath been kind to thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo! God loveth not corrupters.

He said: This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have. Did he not know that God had destroyed, before him, whole generations, which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount of riches they had collected? But the wicked are not called immediately to account for their sins.

So he went forth among his people in the pride of his worldly glitter. Said those whose aim is the Life of this World: Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!

But those who had been granted true knowledge said: Alas for you! The reward of God in the Hereafter is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere in good.

Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not the least little party to help him against God, nor could he defend himself.

And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah, welladay! God enlarges the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straitens it for whom He will. If God had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us also. Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper.

That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high-handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is best for the righteous.

If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished to the extent of their deeds.

Verily He Who ordained the Qur'an for thee, will bring thee back to the Place of Return. Say: My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance, and who is in manifest error.

And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject God's Message.

And let nothing keep thee back from the Signs of God after they have been revealed to thee: and invite men to thy Lord, and be not of the company of those who join gods with God.

And call not, besides God, on another god. There is no god but He. Everything that exists will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye all be brought back.And dispute not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be with those who inflict wrong and injury. Say, "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our God and your God is one; and it is to Him we bow in Islam." And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be in a way that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say: We believe in that which has been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God and your God is One, and unto Him we surrender. And do not dispute with the followers of the Book except by what is best, except those of them who act unjustly, and say: We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him do we submit.

And thus it is that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the People of the Book believe therein, as also do some of these pagan Arabs: and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. In like manner We have revealed unto thee the Scripture, and those unto whom We gave the Scripture aforetime will believe therein; and of these also there are some who believe therein. And none deny Our revelations save the disbelievers. And thus have We revealed the Book to you. So those whom We have given the Book believe in it, and of these there are those who believe in it, and none deny Our communications except the unbelievers.

And thou wast not able to recite a Book before this Book came, nor art thou able to transcribe it with thy right hand: In that case, indeed, would the talkers of vanities have doubted. And thou, O Muhammad, wast not a reader of any scripture before it, nor didst thou write it with thy right hand, for then might those have doubted, who follow falsehood. And you did not recite before it any book, nor did you transcribe one with your right hand, for then could those who say untrue things have doubted.

Nay, here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject Our Signs. But it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge, and none deny Our revelations save wrong-doers. Nay! these are clear communications in the breasts of those who are granted knowledge; and none deny Our communications except the unjust.

They say: "Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "The signs are indeed with God: and I am indeed a clear Warner." And they say: Why are not portents sent down upon him from his Lord? Say: Portents are with God only, and I am but a plain warner. And they say: Why are not signs sent down upon him from his Lord? Say: The signs are only with God, and I am only a plain warner.

And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them? Verily, in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe. Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto thee the Scripture which is read unto them? Lo! herein verily is mercy, and a reminder for folk who believe. Is it not enough for them that We have revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? Most surely there is mercy in this and a reminder for a people who believe.

Say: "Enough is God for a witness between me and you: He knows what is in the heavens and on earth." And it is those who believe in vanities and reject God, that will perish in the end. Say unto them, O Muhammad: God sufficeth for witness between me and you. He knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe in vanity and disbelieve in God, they it is who are the losers. Say: God is sufficient as a witness between me and you; He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And as for those who believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in God, these it is that are the losers.

They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment for them: had it not been for a term of respite appointed, the Punishment would certainly have come to them: and it will certainly reach them, of a sudden, while they perceive not! They bid thee hasten on the doom of God. And if a term had not been appointed, the doom would assuredly have come unto them ere now. And verily it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not. And they ask you to hasten on the chastisement; and had not a term been appointed, the chastisement would certainly have come to them; and most certainly it will come to them all of a sudden while they will not perceive.

They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment: but, of a surety, Hell will encompass the Rejecters of Faith! They bid thee hasten on the doom, when lo! hell verily will encompass the disbelievers. They ask you to hasten on the chastisement, and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers.

On the Day that the Punishment shall cover them from above them and from below them, and a Voice shall say: "Taste ye the fruits of your deeds!" On the day when the doom will overwhelm them from above them and from underneath their feet, and He will say: Taste what ye used to do! On the day when the chastisement shall cover them from above them, and from beneath their feet; and He shall say: Taste what you did.

O My servants who believe! truly, spacious is My Earth: therefore serve ye Me and Me alone! O my bondmen who believe! Lo! My earth is spacious. Therefore serve Me only. O My servants who believe! surely My earth is vast, therefore Me alone should you serve.

Every soul shall have a taste of death: In the end to Us shall ye be brought back. Every soul will taste of death. Then unto Us ye will be returned. Every soul must taste of death, then to Us you shall be brought back.

But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, to them shall We give a Home in Heaven, lofty mansions beneath which flow rivers, to dwell therein for aye; an excellent reward for those who do good! Those who believe and do good works, them verily We shall house in lofty dwellings of the Garden underneath which rivers flow. There they will dwell secure. How sweet the guerdon of the toilers. And as for those who believe and do good, We will certainly give them abode in the high places in gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein; how good the reward of the workers.

Those who persevere in patience, and put their trust, in their Lord and Cherisher. Who persevere, and put their trust in their Lord! Those who are patient, and on their Lord do they rely.

How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance? It is God who feeds both them and you: for He hears and knows all things. And how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision! God provideth for it and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knower. And how many a living creature that does not carry its sustenance: God sustains it and yourselves; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon to his Law, they will certainly reply, "God". How are they then deluded away from the truth? And if thou wert to ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, and constrained the sun and the moon to their appointed work? they would say: God. How then are they turned away? And if you ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the sun and the moon subservient, they will certainly say, God. Whence are they then turned away?

God enlarges the sustenance which He gives to whichever of His servants He pleases; and He similarly grants by strict measure, as He pleases: for God has full knowledge of all things. God maketh the provision wide for whom He will of His bondmen, and straiteneth it for whom He will. Lo! God is Aware of all things. God makes abundant the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants, and straitens them for whom He pleases; surely God is Cognizant of all things.

And if indeed thou ask them who it is that sends down rain from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death, they will certainly reply, "God!" Say, "Praise be to God!" But most of them understand not. And if thou wert to ask them: Who causeth water to come down from the sky, and therewith reviveth the earth after its death? they verily would say: God. Say: Praise be to God! But most of them have no sense. And if you ask them Who is it that sends down water from the clouds, then gives life to the earth with it after its death, they will certainly say, God. Say: All praise is due to God. Nay, most of them do not understand.

What is the life of this world but amusement and play? but verily the Home in the Hereafter, that is life indeed, if they but knew. This life of the world is but a pastime and a game. Lo! the home of the Hereafter - that is Life, if they but knew. And this life of the world is nothing but a sport and a play; and as for the next abode, that most surely is the life did they but know!

Now, if they embark on a boat, they call on God, making their devotion sincerely and exclusively to Him; but when He has delivered them safely to dry land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others! And when they mount upon the ships they pray to God, making their faith pure for Him only, but when He bringeth them safe to land, behold! they ascribe partners unto Him. So when they ride in the ships they call upon God, being sincerely obedient to Him, but when He brings them safe to the land, lo! they associate others with Him.

Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts, and giving themselves up to worldly enjoyment! But soon will they know. That they may disbelieve in that which We have given them, and that they may take their ease. But they will come to know. Thus they become ungrateful for what We have given them, so that they may enjoy; but they shall soon know.

Do they not then see that We have made a sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? Then, do they believe in that which is vain, and reject the Grace of God? Have they not seen that We have appointed a sanctuary immune from violence, while mankind are ravaged all around them? Do they then believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the bounty of God? Do they not see that We have made a sacred territory secure, while men are carried off by force from around them? Will they still believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in the favour of God?His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. And call not with God any other god; there is no god but He, everything is perishable but He; His is the judgment, and to Him you shall be brought back.

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

029.001 Alif. Lam. Mim.
029.002 Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, "We believe", and that they will not be tested?
029.003 We did test those before them, and God will certainly know those who are true from those who are false.
029.004 Do those who practice evil think that they will get the better of Us? Evil is their judgment!
029.005 For those whose hopes are in the meeting with God (in the Hereafter, let them strive); for the term (appointed) by God is surely coming and He hears and knows all things.
029.006 And if any strive (with might and main), they do so for their own souls: for God is free of all needs from all creation.
029.007 Those who believe and work righteous deeds, from them shall We blot out all evil (that may be) in them, and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds.
029.008 We have enjoined on man kindness to parents: but if they (either of them) strive to force thee to join with Me (in worship) anything of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not. Ye have (all) to return to me, and I will tell you (the truth) of all that ye did.
029.009 And those who believe and work righteous deeds, them shall We admit to the company of the Righteous.
029.010 Then there are among men such as say, "We believe in God"; but when they suffer affliction in the cause of God, they treat men's oppression as if it were the Wrath of God! And if help comes to thee from thy Lord, they are sure to say, "We have always been with you!" Does not God know best all that is in the hearts of all creation?
029.011 And God most certainly knows those who believe, and as certainly those who are Hypocrites.
029.012 And the Unbelievers say to those who believe: "Follow our path, and we will bear the consequences of your faults." Never in the least will they bear their faults: in fact, they are liars!
029.013 They will bear their own burdens, and other burdens along with their own, and on the Day of Judgment they will be called to account for their falsehoods.
029.014 We once sent Noah to his people, and he tarried among them a thousand years less fifty: but the Deluge overwhelmed them while they persisted in sin.
029.015 But We saved him and the companions of the Ark, and We made the Ark a Sign for all peoples!
029.016 And We also saved Abraham: behold, he said to his people, "Serve God and fear Him: that will be best for you if ye understand!"
029.017 For ye do worship idols besides God, and ye invent falsehood. The things that ye worship besides God have no power to give you sustenance: then seek ye sustenance from God, serve Him, and be grateful to Him: to Him will be your return.
029.018 And if ye reject the Message, so did generations before you: and the duty of the messenger is only to preach publicly and clearly.
029.019 See they not how God originates creation, then repeats it: truly that is easy for God.
029.020 Say: "Travel through the earth and see how God did originate creation; so will God produce a later creation: for God has power over all things."
029.021 He punishes whom He pleases, and He grants Mercy to whom He pleases, and towards Him are ye turned.
029.022 Not on earth nor in heaven will ye be able to frustrate His Plan, nor have ye, besides God, any protector or helper.
029.023 Those who reject the Signs of God and the Meeting with Him in the Hereafter, it is they who shall despair of My Mercy: it is they who will suffer a most grievous Penalty.
029.024 So naught was the answer of Abraham's people except that they said: "Slay him or burn him." But God did save him from the Fire. Verily in this are Signs for people who believe.Who does greater wrong than one who invents a lie against God or rejects the Truth when it reaches him? Is there not a home in Hell for those who reject Faith? Those who strive in Our cause, We will certainly guide them to Our paths: For verily God is with those who do right.

2. The Roman Empire has been defeated
3. In a land close by; but they, after this defeat, will soon be victorious
4. Within a few years. With God is the Decision, in the past and in the Future: on that Day shall the Believers rejoice
5. With the help of God. He helps whom He will, and He is Exalted in Might, most Merciful.
6. It is the promise of God. Never does God depart from His promise: but most men understand not.
7. They know but the outer things in the life of this world: but of the End of things they are heedless.
8. Do they not reflect in their own minds? Not but for just ends and for a term appointed, did God create the heavens and the earth, and all between them: yet many among men deny the meeting with their Lord.
9. Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength: they tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have done: there came to them their messengers with Clear Signs. It was not God Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls.
10. In the long run, evil in the extreme will be the end of those who do evil; for they rejected the Signs of God, and held them up to ridicule.
11. It is God Who begins the process of creation; then repeats it; then shall you be brought back to Him.
12. On the Day that the Hour will be established, the guilty will be struck dumb with despair.
13. No intercessor will they have among their "Partners" and they will reject their "Partners".
14. On the Day that the Hour will be established, that Day shall all men be sorted out.
15. Then those who have believed and worked righteous deeds shall be made happy in a Mead of Delight.
16. And those who have rejected Faith and falsely denied our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, such shall be brought forth to Punishment.
17. So give glory to God, when you reach eventide and when you rise in the morning;
18. Yea, to Him be praise, in the heavens and on earth; and in the late afternoon and when the day begins to decline.
19. It is He Who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living, and Who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall you be brought out from the dead.
20. Among His Signs is this, that He created you from dust; and then, behold, you are men scattered far and wide!
21. And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your hearts: verily in that are Signs for those who reflect.
22. And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs for those who know.
23. And among His Signs is the sleep that you take by night and by day, and the quest that you make for livelihood out of His Bounty: verily in that are signs for those who hearken.
24. And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope, and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise.
25. And among His Signs is this, that heaven and earth stand by His Command: then when He calls you, by a single call, from the earth, behold, you come forth.", when He calls you, lo! from the earth you will emerge. To Him belongs every being in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to Him. It is He Who begins creation; then repeats it; and for Him, it is most easy. To Him belongs the loftiest similitude in the heavens and the earth: for He is Exalted in Might, full of Wisdom. He propounds to you a similitude from your own experience: do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess, to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you? Do you fear them as you fear each other? Thus do We explain the Signs in detail to a people that understand. Nay, the wrong-doers follow their own lusts, being devoid of knowledge. But who will guide those whom God leaves astray? To them, there will be no helpers. So set your face steadily and truly to the Faith: establish God's handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change in the work wrought by God: that is the standard Religion: but most among mankind understand not. Turn back in repentance to Him, and fear Him: establish regular prayers, and be not among those who join gods with God. Those who split up their Religion and become mere Sects, each party rejoicing in that which is with itself! When trouble touches men, they cry to their Lord, turning back to Him in repentance: but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself, behold, some of them pay part-worship to other gods besides their Lord. As if to show their ingratitude for the favors We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy your brief day; but soon you will know your folly. Or have We sent down authority to them, which points out to them the things to which they pay part-worship? When We give men a taste of Mercy, they exult thereat: and when some evil afflicts them because of what their own hands have sent forth, behold, they are in despair! See they not that God enlarges the provision and restricts it, to whomsoever He pleases? Verily in that are Signs for those who believe. So give what is due to kindred, the needy, and the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek the Countenance of God, and it is they who will prosper. That which you lay out for increase through the property of other people, will have no increase with God: but that which you lay out for charity, seeking the Countenance of God, will increase: it is these who will get a recompense multiplied. It is God Who has created you: further, He has provided for your sustenance; then He will cause you to die; and again He will give you life. Are there any of your false partners who can do any single one of these things? Glory to Him! and high is He above the partners they attribute to Him! Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of the meed that the hands of men have earned, that God may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back from Evil. Say: Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before you: Most of them worshipped others besides God. But set your face to the right Religion before there comes from God the Day which there is no chance of averting: on that Day shall men be divided in two. Those who reject Faith will suffer from that rejection: and those who work righteousness will spread their couch of repose for themselves in heaven. That He may reward those who believe and work righteous deeds, out of His Bounty. For He loves not those who reject Faith. Among His Signs is this, that He sends the Winds, as heralds of Glad Tidings, giving you a taste of His Grace and Mercy, that the ships may sail majestically by His Command and that you may seek of His Bounty: in order that you may be grateful.""except that they said: Slay him or burn him; then God delivered him from the fire; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe. 029.025 And he said: 'For you, ye have taken (for worship) idols besides God, out of mutual love and regard between yourselves in this life; but on the Day of Judgment ye shall disown each other and curse each other: and your abode will be the Fire, and ye shall have none to help.' 029.026 But Lut had faith in Him: He said: 'I will leave home for the sake of my Lord: for He is Exalted in Might, and Wise.' 029.027 And We gave (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation, and We granted him his reward in this life; and he was in the Hereafter (of the company) of the Righteous. 029.028 And (remember) Lut: behold, he said to his people: 'Ye do commit lewdness, such as no people in Creation (ever) committed before you.' 029.029 'Do ye indeed approach men, and cut off the highway?- and practise wickedness (even) in your councils?' But his people gave no answer but this: they said: 'Bring us the Wrath of God if thou tellest the truth.' 029.030 He said: 'O my Lord! help Thou me against people who do mischief!' 029.031 When Our Messengers came to Abraham with the good news, they said: 'We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township: for truly they are (addicted to) crime.' 029.032 He said: 'But there is Lut there.' They said: 'Well do we know who is there: we will certainly save him and his following,- except his wife: she is of those who lag behind!' 029.033 And when Our Messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account, and felt himself powerless (to protect) them: but they said: 'Fear thou not, nor grieve: we are (here) to save thee and thy following, except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind.' 029.034 'For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a Punishment from heaven, because they have been wickedly rebellious.' 029.035 And We have left thereof an evident Sign, for any people who (care to) understand. 029.036 To the Madyan (people) (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. Then he said: 'O my people! serve God, and fear the Last Day: nor commit evil on the earth, with intent to do mischief.' 029.037 But they rejected him: Then the mighty Blast seized them, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning. 029.038 (Remember also) the 'Ad and the Thamud (people): clearly will appear to you from (the traces) of their buildings (their fate): the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them, and kept them back from the Path, though they were gifted with intelligence and skill. 029.039 (Remember also) Qarun, Pharaoh, and Haman: there came to them Moses with Clear Signs, but they behaved with insolence on the earth; yet they could not overreach (Us). 029.040 Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them, against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters): It was not God Who injured (or oppressed) them: They injured (and oppressed) their own souls. 029.041 The parable of those who take protectors other than God is that of the spider, who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider's house;- if they but knew. 029.042 Verily God doth know of (every thing) whatever that they call upon besides Him: and He is Exalted (in power), Wise. 029.043 And such are the Parables We set forth for mankind, but only those understand them who have knowledge. 029.044 God created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): verily in that is a Sign for those who believe. 029.045 Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of God is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. And God knows the (deeds) that ye do.""Remembrance of God is the greatest, and God knows what you do. 029.046 And dispute not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be with those who inflict wrong: but say, 'We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our God and your God is one; and it is to Him we bow.' 029.047 And thus We have sent down the Book to thee. So the People of the Book believe therein, as also do some of these (pagan Arabs): and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. 029.048 And thou wast not able to recite a Book before this, nor art thou able to transcribe it with thy right hand: In that case, indeed, would the talkers of vanities have doubted. 029.049 Nay, here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject Our Signs. 029.050 They say: 'Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord?' Say: 'The signs are indeed with God: and I am indeed a clear Warner.' 029.051 And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them? Verily, in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe. 029.052 Say: 'Enough is God for a witness between me and you: He knows what is in the heavens and on earth.' And it is those who believe in vanities and reject God, that will perish. 029.053 They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment: had it not been for a term appointed, the Punishment would certainly have come to them: and it will certainly reach them, of a sudden, while they perceive not! 029.054 They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment: but, of a surety, Hell will encompass the Rejecters of Faith! 029.055 On the Day that the Punishment shall cover them from above them and from below them, and a Voice shall say: 'Taste ye the fruits of your deeds!' 029.056 O My servants who believe! truly, spacious is My Earth: therefore serve ye Me alone! 029.057 Every soul shall have a taste of death: In the end to Us shall ye be brought back. 029.058 But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness - to them shall We give a Home in Heaven, lofty mansions beneath which flow rivers, to dwell therein for aye; an excellent reward for those who do good! 029.059 Those who persevere in patience, and put their trust in their Lord. 029.060 How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance? It is God who feeds both them and you: for He hears and knows all things. 029.061 If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon, they will certainly reply, 'God.' How are they then deluded away from the truth? 029.062 God enlarges the sustenance which He gives to whichever of His servants He pleases; and He similarly grants by strict measure, as He pleases: for God has full knowledge of all things. 029.063 And if indeed thou ask them who it is that sends down rain from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death, they will certainly reply, 'God!' Say, 'Praise be to God!' But most of them understand not. 029.064 What is the life of this world but amusement and play? but verily the Home in the Hereafter, that is life indeed, if they but knew. 029.065 Now, if they embark on a boat, they call on God, making their devotion sincerely to Him; but when He has delivered them safely to dry land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others! 029.066 Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts, and giving themselves up to worldly enjoyment! But soon will they know. 029.067 Do they not then see that We have made a sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? Then, do they believe in that which is vain, and reject the Grace of God? 029.068 And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against God?"st God or rejects the Truth when it reaches him? Is there not a home in Hell for those who reject Faith? Who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie concerning God or denies the truth when it comes to him? Is there not a home in hell for disbelievers? And those who strive in Our cause, We will certainly guide them to our Paths: For verily God is with those who do right. As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths, and God is with the good. And those who strive hard for Us, We will most certainly guide them in Our ways; and God is most surely with the doers of good.

Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A. L. M. The Roman Empire has been defeated in a land close by; but they, after this defeat, will soon be victorious within a few years. With God is the Decision, in the past and in the Future: on that Day shall the Believers rejoice with the help of God. He helps whom He will, and He is Exalted in Might, most Merciful. It is the promise of God. Never does God depart from His promise: but most men understand not. They know but the outer things in the life of this world, but of the End of things they are heedless. Do they not reflect in their own minds? Not but for just ends and for a term appointed, did God create the heavens and the earth, and all between them: yet many among men deny the meeting with their Lord at the Resurrection.

Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength: they tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have done. There came to them their messengers with Clear Signs. It was not God Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls. In the long run, evil in the extreme will be the end of those who do evil; for they rejected the Signs of God and held them up to ridicule. It is God Who begins the process of creation; then repeats it; then shall you be brought back to Him. On the Day that the Hour will be established, the guilty will be struck dumb with despair. No intercessor will they have among their "Partners" and they will themselves reject their "Partners."

On the Day that the Hour will be established, that Day shall all men be sorted out. Then those who have believed and worked righteous deeds shall be made happy in a Mead of Delight. And those who have rejected Faith and falsely denied our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, such shall be brought forth to Punishment. So give glory to God when you reach eventide and when you rise in the morning. Yea, to Him be praise, in the heavens and on earth; and in the late afternoon and when the day begins to decline. It is He Who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living, and Who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall you be brought out from the dead.

Among His Signs is this: He created you from dust; and then, behold, you are men scattered far and wide! And among His Signs is this: He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your hearts: verily in that are Signs for those who reflect. And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colors: verily in that are Signs for those who know. And among His Signs is the sleep that you take by night and by day, and the quest that you make for livelihood out of His Bounty: verily in that are signs for those who hearken. And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope, and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise. And among His Signs is this: The heavens and the earth stand fast by His command, and afterward...S: And one of His signs is that He sends forth the winds bearing good news, and that He may make you taste of His mercy, and that the ships may run by His command, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may be grateful. 030.047 Y: We did indeed send, before thee, messengers to their respective peoples, and they came to them with Clear Signs: then, to those who transgressed, We meted out Retribution: and it was due from Us to aid those who believed. P: Verily We sent before thee (Muhammad) messengers to their own folk. Then we took vengeance upon those who were guilty. To help believers is ever incumbent upon Us. S: And certainly We sent before you messengers to their people, so they came to them with clear arguments, then We gave the punishment to those who were guilty; and helping the believers is ever incumbent on Us. 030.048 Y: It is God Who sends the Winds, and they raise the Clouds: then does He spread them in the sky as He wills, and break them into fragments, until thou seest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof: then when He has made them reach such of His servants as He wills behold, they do rejoice! P: God is He Who sendeth the winds so that they raise clouds, and spreadeth them along the sky as pleaseth Him, and causeth them to break and thou seest the rain downpouring from within them. And when He maketh it to fall on whom He will of His bondmen, lo! they rejoice; S: God is He Who sends forth the winds so they raise a cloud, then He spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases, and He breaks it up so that you see the rain coming forth from inside it; then when He causes it to fall upon whom He pleases of His servants, lo! they are joyful, 030.049 Y: Even though, before they received the rain, they were dumb with despair! P: Though before that, even before it was sent down upon them, they were in despair. S: Though they were before this, before it was sent down upon them, confounded in sure despair. 030.050 Y: Then contemplate the memorials of God's Mercy! How He gives life to the earth after its death: verily the same will give life to the men who are dead: for He has power over all things. P: Look, therefore, at the prints of God's mercy in creation: how He quickeneth the earth after her death. Lo! He verily is the Quickener of the Dead, and He is Able to do all things. S: Look then at the signs of God's mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death, most surely He will raise the dead to life; and He has power over all things. 030.051 Y: And if We but send a Wind from which they see their tilth turn yellow, behold, they become, thereafter, Ungrateful! P: And if We sent a wind and they beheld it yellow, they verily would still continue in their disbelief. S: And if We send a wind and they see it to be yellow, they would after that certainly continue to disbelieve, 030.052 Y: So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they show their backs and turn away. P: For verily thou (Muhammad) canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee. S: For surely you cannot make the dead to hear and you cannot make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn back and flee. 030.053 Y: Nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying: only those wilt thou make to hear, who believe in Our signs and submit their wills in Islam. P: Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to hear save those who believe in Our revelations so that they surrender unto Him. S: Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error. You cannot make to hear any but those who believe in Our communications so they shall submit. 030.054 Y: It is God Who created you in a state of helpless weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then, after strength, gave you weakness and a hoary head: He creates as He wills, and it is He Who has all knowledge and power. P: God is He Who shaped you out of weakness, then appointed after weakness strength, then, after strength, appointed weakness and grey hair. He createth what He will. He is the Knower, the Mighty. S: God is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and hoary hair after strength; He creates what He pleases, and He is the Knowing, the Powerful. 030.055 Y: On the Day that the Hour of Reckoning will be established, the transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour: thus were they used to being deluded! P: And on the day when the Hour riseth the guilty will vow that they did tarry but an hour - thus were they ever deceived. S: And at the time when the hour shall come, the guilty shall swear that they did not tarry but an hour; thus are they ever turned away. 030.056 Y: But those endued with knowledge and faith will say: "Indeed ye did tarry, within God's Decree, to the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection: but ye were not aware!" P: But those to whom knowledge and faith are given will say: The truth is, ye have tarried, by God's decree, until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, but ye used not to know. S: And those who are given knowledge and faith will say: Certainly you tarried according to the ordinance of God till the day of resurrection, so this is the day of resurrection, but you did not know. 030.057 Y: So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors, nor will they be invited then to seek grace by repentance. P: In that day their excuses will not profit those who did injustice, nor will they be allowed to make amends. S: But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who were unjust, nor shall they be regarded with goodwill. 030.058 Y: Verily We have propounded for men, in this Qur'an every kind of Parable: But if thou bring to them any Sign, the Unbelievers are sure to say, "Ye do nothing but talk vanities." P: Verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of similitudes; and indeed if thou camest unto them with a miracle, those who disbelieve would verily exclaim: Ye are but tricksters! S: And certainly We have set forth for men every kind of example in this Quran; and if you should bring them a communication, those who disbelieve would certainly say: You are naught but false claimants. 030.059 Y: Thus does God seal up the hearts of those who understand not. P: Thus doth God seal the hearts of those who know not. S: Thus does God set a seal on the hearts of those who do not know. 030.060 Y: So patiently persevere: for verily the promise of God is true: nor let those shake thy firmness, who have themselves no certainty of faith. P: So have patience (O Muhammad)! God's promise is the very truth, and let not those who have no certainty make thee impatient. S: Therefore be patient; surely the promise of God is true and let not those who have no certainty hold you in light estimation. - Chapter 31: LUQMAN (LUQMAN) Total Verses: 34 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 031.001 Y: A.

P: And of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse, that he may mislead from God's way without knowledge, and maketh it the butt of mockery. For such there is a shameful doom. S: And of men is he who takes instead frivolous discourse to lead astray from God's path without knowledge, and to take it for a mockery; these shall have an abasing chastisement. 031.007 Y: When Our Signs are rehearsed to such a one, he turns away in arrogance, as if he heard them not, as if there were deafness in both his ears: announce to him a grievous Penalty. P: And when Our revelations are recited unto him he turneth away in pride as if he heard them not, as if there were a deafness in his ears. So give him tidings of a painful doom.

And We send down water from the sky and We cause plants of every goodly kind to grow therein. S: He created the heavens without pillars as you see them, and put mountains upon the earth lest it might convulse with you, and He spread in it animals of every kind; and We sent down water from the cloud, then caused to grow therein vegetation of every noble kind. 031.011 Y: Such is the Creation of God: now show Me what is there that others besides Him have created: nay, but the Transgressors are in manifest error. P: This is the Creation of God. Now show me that which those ye worship beside Him have created. Nay, but the wrong-doers are in error manifest! S: This is God's creation, but show Me what those beside Him have created.", when He calls you, lo! from the earth you will emerge. To Him belongs every being in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to Him. It is He Who begins creation; then repeats it; and for Him, it is most easy. To Him belongs the loftiest similitude in the heavens and the earth: for He is Exalted in Might, full of Wisdom. He propounds to you a similitude from your own experience: do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess, to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you? Do you fear them as you fear each other? Thus do We explain the Signs in detail to a people that understand. Nay, the wrong-doers follow their own lusts, being devoid of knowledge. But who will guide those whom God leaves astray? To them, there will be no helpers. So set your face steadily and truly to the Faith: establish God's handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change in the work wrought by God: that is the standard Religion: but most among mankind understand not. Turn back in repentance to Him, and fear Him: establish regular prayers, and be not among those who join gods with God.

Among His Signs is this, that He sends the Winds, as heralds of Glad Tidings, giving you a taste of His Grace and Mercy, that the ships may sail majestically by His Command and that you may seek of His Bounty: in order that you may be grateful."We bestowed Wisdom on Luqman: "Show gratitude to God." Any who is grateful does so to the profit of his own soul: but if any is ungrateful, God is free of all wants, Worthy of all praise. And verily We gave Luqman wisdom, saying: Give thanks unto God; and whosoever gives thanks, he gives thanks for the good of his soul. And whosoever refuses - God is Absolute, Owner of Praise. Behold, Luqman said to his son by way of instruction: "O my son! join not in worship others with God: for false worship is indeed the highest wrong-doing." And (remember) when Luqman said unto his son, when he was exhorting him: O my dear son! Ascribe no partners unto God. To ascribe partners unto Him is a tremendous wrong. And We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him, and in years twain was his weaning: "Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents: to Me is thy final Goal." And We have enjoined upon man concerning his parents - His mother bears him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years - Give thanks unto Me and unto thy parents. Unto Me is the journeying. And if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not; yet bear them company in this life with justice and consideration, and follow the way of those who turn to Me in love: in the end the return of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth of all that ye did. But if they strive with thee to make thee ascribe unto Me as partner that of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Consort with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who repents unto Me. Then unto Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. "O my son!" said Luqman, "If there be but the weight of a mustard-seed and it were hidden in a rock, or anywhere in the heavens or on earth, God will bring it forth: for God understands the finest mysteries, and is well-acquainted with them." O my dear son! Though it be but the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth. God is Subtle, Aware. "O my son! establish regular prayer, enjoin what is just, and forbid what is wrong: and bear with patient constancy whatever betide thee; for this is firmness of purpose in the conduct of affairs." O my dear son! Establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity, and persevere whatever may befall thee. That is of the steadfast heart of things. "And swell not thy cheek for pride at men, nor walk in insolence through the earth; for God loves not any arrogant boaster." Turn not thy cheek in scorn toward folk, nor walk with pertness in the land. God loves not each braggart boaster. "And be moderate in thy pace, and lower thy voice; for the harshest of sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass." Be modest in thy bearing and subdue thy voice. The harshest of all voices is the voice of the ass. Do ye not see that God has subjected to your use all things in the heavens and on earth, and has made his bounties flow to you in exceeding measure, both seen and unseen? Yet there are among men those who dispute about God, without knowledge and without guidance, and without a Book to enlighten them! See ye not how God has made serviceable unto you whatsoever is in the skies and whatsoever is in the earth and has loaded you with His favors both without and within? Yet of mankind is he who disputes concerning God, without knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light. When they are told to follow the Revelation that God has sent down, they say: "Nay, we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers following." What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Penalty of the Blazing Fire? And if it be said unto them: Follow that which God has revealed, they say: Nay, but we follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though the devil were inviting them unto the doom of flame? Whoever submits his whole self to God, and is a doer of good, has grasped indeed the most trustworthy hand-hold: and with God rests the End and Decision of all affairs. Whosoever surrenders his purpose to God while doing good, he verily has grasped the firm hand-hold. Unto God belongs the sequel of all things. But if any reject Faith, let not his rejection grieve thee: to Us is their return, and We shall tell them the truth of their deeds: for God knows well all that is in men's hearts. And whosoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief afflict thee. Unto Us is their return, and We shall tell them what they did. God is Aware of what is in the breasts of men. We grant them their pleasure for a little while: in the end shall We drive them to a chastisement unrelenting. We give them comfort for a little, and then We drive them to a heavy doom. If thou ask them, who it is that created the heavens and the earth. They will certainly say, "God". Say: "Praise be to God!" But most of them understand not. If thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth? they would answer: God. Say: Praise be to God! But most of them know not. To God belong all things in heaven and earth: verily God is He that is free of all wants, worthy of all praise. Unto God belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. God, He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean were ink, with seven oceans behind it to add to its supply, yet would not the words of God be exhausted in the writing: for God is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. And if all the trees in the earth were pens, and the sea, with seven more seas to help it, were ink, the words of God could not be exhausted. God is Mighty, Wise. And your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individual soul: for God is He Who hears and sees all things. Your creation and your raising from the dead are only as the creation and the raising of a single soul. God is Hearer, Knower. Seest thou not that God merges Night into Day and He merges Day into Night; that He has subjected the sun, and the moon to His Law, each running its course for a term appointed; and that God is well-acquainted with all that ye do? Hast thou not seen how God causes the night to pass into the day and causes the day to pass into the night, and has subdued the sun and the moon to do their work, each running unto an appointed term; and that God is Informed of what ye do? That is because God is the only Reality, and because whatever else they invoke besides Him is Falsehood; and because God, He is the Most High, Most Great. That is so because God, He is the True, and that which they invoke beside Him is the False, and because God, He is the Sublime, the Great."Do you not see that the ships run on the sea by God's favor, showing you His signs? Surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful heart. When a wave covers them like a canopy, they call to God with sincere devotion. But when He delivers them safely to land, some of them halt between right and wrong. None reject Our signs except the perfidious and ungrateful. O mankind! Do your duty to your Lord and fear the Day when no father can avail his son, nor a son avail his father. The promise of God is true: let not this present life deceive you, nor let the chief Deceiver deceive you about God. Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with God alone. He sends down rain and knows what is in the wombs. No one knows what they will earn tomorrow, nor in what land they will die. God is Knowing and Aware.

Chapter 32: AS-SAJDA (THE PROSTRATION, WORSHIP, ADORATION)
Total Verses: 30
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Alif. Lam. Mim. This is the Revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt, from the Lord of the Worlds. Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Nay, it is the Truth from your Lord, that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so they may receive guidance. God created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and is firmly established on the Throne of Authority. You have none besides Him to protect or intercede for you. Will you not then receive admonition? He rules all affairs from the heavens to the earth, and in the end, all affairs will go up to Him, on a Day whose space is as a thousand years of your reckoning. Such is He, the Knower of all things, hidden and open, the Exalted in power, the Merciful. He made everything He created most good and began the creation of man from clay. He made his progeny from a quintessence of a fluid despised. He fashioned him in due proportion and breathed into him something of His spirit. He gave you hearing, sight, and understanding, yet little thanks do you give!

They say, "What! When we lie hidden and lost in the earth, shall we indeed be in a Creation renewed?" Nay, they deny the Meeting with their Lord. Say: "The Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will duly take your souls, then you will be brought back to your Lord." If only you could see when the guilty ones will bend low their heads before their Lord, saying, "Our Lord! We have seen and heard. Now send us back to the world; we will work righteousness, for we indeed believe." If We had so willed, We could have brought every soul its true guidance, but the Word from Me will come true: "I will fill Hell with jinns and men all together." Taste then, for you forgot the Meeting of this Day of yours, and We too will forget you. Taste the Penalty of Eternity for your evil deeds!

Only those believe in Our Signs who, when they are recited to them, fall down in prostration and celebrate the praises of their Lord, without pride. Their limbs forsake their beds of sleep while they call on their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend in charity out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden for them as a reward for their good deeds. Is the man who believes better than the man who is rebellious and wicked? They are not equal. For those who believe and do righteous deeds, there are Gardens as hospitable homes for their good deeds. As for those who are rebellious and wicked, their abode will be the Fire."S: And one of His signs is that He sends forth the winds bearing good news, and that He may make you taste of His mercy, and that the ships may run by His command, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may be grateful. 030.047 Y: We did indeed send, before thee, messengers to their respective peoples, and they came to them with Clear Signs: then, to those who transgressed, We meted out Retribution: and it was due from Us to aid those who believed. P: Verily We sent before thee (Muhammad) messengers to their own folk. Then we took vengeance upon those who were guilty. To help believers is ever incumbent upon Us. S: And certainly We sent before you messengers to their people, so they came to them with clear arguments, then We gave the punishment to those who were guilty; and helping the believers is ever incumbent on Us. 030.048 Y: It is God Who sends the Winds, and they raise the Clouds: then does He spread them in the sky as He wills, and break them into fragments, until thou seest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof: then when He has made them reach such of his servants as He wills behold, they do rejoice! P: God is He Who sendeth the winds so that they raise clouds, and spreadeth them along the sky as pleaseth Him, and causeth them to break and thou seest the rain downpouring from within them. And when He maketh it to fall on whom He will of His bondmen, lo! they rejoice; S: God is He Who sends forth the winds so they raise a cloud, then He spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases, and He breaks it up so that you see the rain coming forth from inside it; then when He causes it to fall upon whom He pleases of His servants, lo! they are joyful, 030.049 Y: Even though, before they received the rain, they were dumb with despair! P: Though before that, even before it was sent down upon them, they were in despair. S: Though they were before this, before it was sent down upon them, confounded in sure despair. 030.050 Y: Then contemplate the memorials of God's Mercy: how He gives life to the earth after its death: verily the same will give life to the men who are dead: for He has power over all things. P: Look, therefore, at the prints of God's mercy in creation: how He quickeneth the earth after her death. Lo! He verily is the Quickener of the Dead, and He is Able to do all things. S: Look then at the signs of God's mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death, most surely He will raise the dead to life; and He has power over all things. 030.051 Y: And if We but send a Wind from which they see their tilth turn yellow, behold, they become, thereafter, Ungrateful! P: And if We sent a wind and they beheld it yellow, they verily would still continue in their disbelief. S: And if We send a wind and they see it to be yellow, they would after that certainly continue to disbelieve, 030.052 Y: So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they show their backs and turn away. P: For verily thou (Muhammad) canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee. S: For surely you cannot make the dead to hear and you cannot make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn back and flee. 030.053 Y: Nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying: only those wilt thou make to hear, who believe in Our signs and submit their wills in Islam. P: Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to hear save those who believe in Our revelations so that they surrender unto Him. S: Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error. You cannot make to hear any but those who believe in Our communications so they shall submit. 030.054 Y: It is God Who created you in a state of helpless weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then, after strength, gave you weakness and a hoary head: He creates as He wills, and it is He Who has all knowledge and power. P: God is He Who shaped you out of weakness, then appointed after weakness strength, then, after strength, appointed weakness and grey hair. He createth what He will. He is the Knower, the Mighty. S: God is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and hoary hair after strength; He creates what He pleases, and He is the Knowing, the Powerful. 030.055 Y: On the Day that the Hour of Reckoning will be established, the transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour: thus were they used to being deluded! P: And on the day when the Hour riseth the guilty will vow that they did tarry but an hour - thus were they ever deceived. S: And at the time when the hour shall come, the guilty shall swear that they did not tarry but an hour; thus are they ever turned away. 030.056 Y: But those endued with knowledge and faith will say: "Indeed ye did tarry, within God's Decree, to the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection: but ye were not aware!" P: But those to whom knowledge and faith are given will say: The truth is, ye have tarried, by God's decree, until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, but ye used not to know. S: And those who are given knowledge and faith will say: Certainly you tarried according to the ordinance of God till the day of resurrection, so this is the day of resurrection, but you did not know. 030.057 Y: So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors, nor will they be invited then to seek grace by repentance. P: In that day their excuses will not profit those who did injustice, nor will they be allowed to make amends. S: But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who were unjust, nor shall they be regarded with goodwill. 030.058 Y: Verily We have propounded for men, in this Qur'an every kind of Parable: But if thou bring to them any Sign, the Unbelievers are sure to say, "Ye do nothing but talk vanities." P: Verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of similitudes; and indeed if thou camest unto them with a miracle, those who disbelieve would verily exclaim: Ye are but tricksters! S: And certainly We have set forth for men every kind of example in this Quran; and if you should bring them a communication, those who disbelieve would certainly say: You are naught but false claimants. 030.059 Y: Thus does God seal up the hearts of those who understand not. P: Thus doth God seal the hearts of those who know not. S: Thus does God set a seal on the hearts of those who do not know. 030.060 Y: So patiently persevere: for verily the promise of God is true: nor let those shake thy firmness, who have themselves no certainty of faith. P: So have patience (O Muhammad)! God's promise is the very truth, and let not those who have no certainty make thee impatient. S: Therefore be patient; surely the promise of God is true and let not those who have no certainty hold you in light estimation. - Chapter 31: LUQMAN (LUQMAN) Total Verses: 34 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 031.001 Y: A.

P: Those who establish worship and pay the poor-due and have sure faith in the Hereafter. S: Those who keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and they are certain of the hereafter. 031.005 Y: These are on true guidance from their Lord: and these are the ones who will prosper. P: Such have guidance from their Lord. Such are the successful. S: These are on a guidance from their Lord, and these are they who are successful: 031.006 Y: But there are, among men, those who purchase idle tales, without knowledge or meaning, to mislead men from the Path of God and throw ridicule on the Path: for such there will be a Humiliating Penalty. P: And of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse, that he may mislead from God's way without knowledge, and maketh it the butt of mockery. For such there is a shameful doom. S: And of men is he who takes instead frivolous discourse to lead astray from God's path without knowledge, and to take it for a mockery; these shall have an abasing chastisement. 031.007 Y: When Our Signs are rehearsed to such a one, he turns away in arrogance, as if he heard them not, as if there were deafness in both his ears: announce to him a grievous Penalty. P: And when Our revelations are recited unto him he turneth away in pride as if he heard them not, as if there were a deafness in his ears. So give him tidings of a painful doom. S: And when Our communications are recited to him, he turns back proudly, as if he had not heard them, as though in his ears were a heaviness, therefore announce to him a painful chastisement. 031.008 Y: For those who believe and work righteous deeds, there will be Gardens of Bliss, P: Lo! those who believe and do good works, for them are the gardens of delight, S: As for those who believe and do good, they shall surely have gardens of bliss, 031.009 Y: To dwell therein. The promise of God is true: and He is Exalted in Power, Wise. P: Wherein they will abide. It is a promise of God in truth. He is the Mighty, the Wise. S: Abiding in them; the promise of God; a true promise, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 031.010 Y: He created the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; He set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; and He scattered through it beasts of all kinds. We send down rain from the sky, and produce on the earth every kind of noble creature, in pairs. P: He hath created the heavens without supports that ye can see, and hath cast into the earth firm hills, so that it quake not with you; and He hath dispersed therein all kinds of beasts. And We send down water from the sky and We cause plants of every goodly kind to grow therein. S: He created the heavens without pillars as you see them, and put mountains upon the earth lest it might convulse with you, and He spread in it animals of every kind; and We sent down water from the cloud, then caused to grow therein vegetation of every noble kind. 031.011 Y: Such is the Creation of God: now show Me what is there that others besides Him have created: nay, but the Transgressors are in manifest error. P: This is the Creation of God. Now show me that which those ye worship beside Him have created. Nay, but the wrong-doers are in error manifest! S: This is God's creation, but show Me what those beside Him have created. Nay, but the wrong-doers are in error manifest!Fire: every time they wish to escape, they will be forced back, and it will be said: "Taste the Penalty of the Fire you used to deny." For those who do evil, their retreat is the Fire. Whenever they desire to leave, they are brought back and told: "Taste the torment of the Fire you denied." We will make them taste the Penalty of this life before the supreme Penalty, so they may repent. Who does more wrong than one who turns away from the Signs of his Lord? We shall exact Retribution from the transgressors. We gave the Book to Moses as a guide for the Children of Israel. We appointed leaders from among them who guided by Our command when they were patient and had faith in Our Signs. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences. Does it not teach them a lesson how many generations We destroyed before them? They walk in their dwellings. Do they not see that We drive rain to parched soil and produce crops for their cattle and themselves? They say: "When will this decision be, if you are truthful?" Say: "On the Day of Decision, it will not benefit Unbelievers to believe, nor will they be granted respite." So turn away from them and wait; they too are waiting.

Chapter 33: AL-AHZAB (THE CLANS, THE COALITION, THE COMBINED FORCES)
Total Verses: 73
Revealed At: MADINA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

O Prophet! Fear God and do not obey the Unbelievers and Hypocrites. Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Put your trust in God; He is sufficient as a disposer of affairs. God has not made for any man two hearts in his body, nor has He made your wives whom you divorce by Zihar your mothers, nor your adopted sons your real sons. Call them by their fathers' names; this is more just in the sight of God. If you do not know their fathers, they are your brothers in faith. The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations have closer personal ties in the Decree of God. Remember We took a covenant from the prophets, including you, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary. God will question the custodians of Truth concerning the Truth they were charged with and has prepared a grievous Penalty for the Unbelievers. O you who believe! Remember the Grace of God when hosts came down on you, but We sent against them a hurricane and forces you did not see. God sees all that you do. When they came upon you from above and below, your eyes became dim, and your hearts gaped up to your throats, and you imagined various thoughts about God. In that situation, the Believers were tried and shaken.We bestowed Wisdom on Luqman: "Show gratitude to God." Any who is grateful does so to the profit of his own soul: but if any is ungrateful, God is free of all wants, Worthy of all praise. And verily We gave Luqman wisdom, saying: Give thanks unto God; and whosoever gives thanks, he gives thanks for the good of his soul. And whosoever refuses - God is Absolute, Owner of Praise. Behold, Luqman said to his son by way of instruction: "O my son! join not in worship others with God: for false worship is indeed the highest wrong-doing." And when Luqman said to his son while he admonished him: O my son! do not associate aught with God; most surely polytheism is a grievous iniquity. And We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him, and in years twain was his weaning: "Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents: to Me is thy final Goal." But if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not; yet bear them company in this life with justice and consideration, and follow the way of those who turn to me in love: in the end the return of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth of all that ye did. "O my son!" said Luqman, "If there be but the weight of a mustard-seed and it were hidden in a rock, or anywhere in the heavens or on earth, God will bring it forth: for God understands the finest mysteries, and is well-acquainted with them." O my son! establish regular prayer, enjoin what is just, and forbid what is wrong: and bear with patient constancy whatever betide thee; for this is firmness of purpose in the conduct of affairs. "And swell not thy cheek for pride at men, nor walk in insolence through the earth; for God loves not any arrogant boaster." Be modest in thy bearing and subdue thy voice. Lo! the harshest of all voices is the voice of the ass. Do ye not see that God has subjected to your use all things in the heavens and on earth, and has made his bounties flow to you in exceeding measure, both seen and unseen? Yet there are among men those who dispute about God, without knowledge and without guidance, and without a Book to enlighten them! When they are told to follow the Revelation that God has sent down, they say: "Nay, we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers following." What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Penalty of the Blazing Fire? Whoever submits his whole self to God, and is a doer of good, has grasped indeed the most trustworthy hand-hold: and with God rests the End and Decision of all affairs. But if any reject Faith, let not his rejection grieve thee: to Us is their return, and We shall tell them the truth of their deeds: for God knows well all that is in men's hearts. We grant them their pleasure for a little while: in the end shall We drive them to a chastisement unrelenting. If thou ask them, who it is that created the heavens and the earth. They will certainly say, "God". Say: "Praise be to God!" But most of them understand not. To God belong all things in heaven and earth: verily God is He that is free of all wants, worthy of all praise. And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean were ink, with seven oceans behind it to add to its supply, yet would not the words of God be exhausted in the writing: for God is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. And your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individual soul: for God is He Who hears and sees all things. Seest thou not that God merges Night into Day and He merges Day into Night; that He has subjected the sun, and the moon to his Law, each running its course for a term appointed; and that God is well-acquainted with all that ye do? That is because God is the only Reality, and because whatever else they invoke besides Him is Falsehood; and because God, He is the Most High, Most Great.There the believers were tried and shaken with severe shaking. And behold! The Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease say: "God and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!" A party among them said: "Ye men of Yathrib! ye cannot stand (the attack)! therefore go back!" And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet, saying, "Truly our houses are bare and exposed," though they were not exposed; they intended nothing but to run away. And if an entry had been effected to them from the sides of the city, and they had been incited to sedition, they would certainly have brought it to pass, with none but a brief delay! And yet they had already covenanted with God not to turn their backs, and a covenant with God must be answered for. Say: "Running away will not profit you if ye are running away from death or slaughter; and even if ye do escape, no more than a brief respite will ye be allowed to enjoy!" Say: "Who is it that can screen you from God if it be His wish to give you punishment or to give you Mercy?" Nor will they find for themselves, besides God, any protector or helper. Verily God knows those among you who keep back (men) and those who say to their brethren, "Come along to us," but come not to the fight except for just a little while. Covetous over you. Then when fear comes, thou wilt see them looking to thee, their eyes revolving, like one over whom hovers death: but when the fear is past, they will smite you with sharp tongues, covetous of goods. Such men have no faith, and so God has made their deeds of none effect: and that is easy for God. They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederates should come again, they would wish they were in the deserts among the Bedouins, and seeking news about you from a safe distance; and if they were in your midst, they would fight but little. Ye have indeed in the Messenger of God a beautiful pattern of conduct for anyone whose hope is in God and the Final Day, and who engages much in the Praise of God. When the Believers saw the Confederate forces, they said: "This is what God and his Messenger had promised us, and God and His Messenger told us what was true." And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience. Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with God: of them some have completed their vow to the extreme, and some still wait: but they have never changed their determination in the least. That God may reward the men of Truth for their Truth, and punish the Hypocrites if that be His Will, or turn to them in Mercy: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And God turned back the Unbelievers for all their fury: no advantage did they gain; and enough is God for the believers in their fight. And God is full of Strength, able to enforce His Will. And those of the People of the Book who aided them - God did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. Some ye slew, and some ye made prisoners. And He made you heirs of their lands, their houses, and their goods, and of a land which ye had not frequented before. And God has power over all things. O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts: "If it be that ye desire the life of this World, and its glitter, then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and set you free in a handsome manner." But if ye seek God and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, verily God has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward. O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct, the Punishment would be doubled to her, and that is easy for God."Do you not see that the ships run on in the sea by God's favor that He may show you His signs? Most surely there are signs in this for every patient endurer, grateful one. When a wave covers them like the canopy of clouds, they call to God, offering Him sincere devotion. But when He has delivered them safely to land, some of them compromise. None deny Our signs except every traitor, ungrateful one. O mankind! Do your duty to your Lord, and fear a Day when no father can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father. Verily, the promise of God is true: let not this present life deceive you, nor let the chief Deceiver deceive you about God. Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with God alone. It is He Who sends down rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs. Nor does anyone know what it is that he will earn on the morrow: Nor does anyone know in what land he is to die. Verily with God is full knowledge and He is acquainted with all things."Fire: every time they wish to get away therefrom, they will be forced thereinto, and it will be said to them: "Taste ye the Penalty of the Fire, the which ye were wont to reject as false." And as for those who do evil, their retreat is the Fire. Whenever they desire to issue forth from thence, they are brought back thither. Unto them it is said: Taste the torment of the Fire which ye used to deny. And as for those who transgress, their abode is the fire; whenever they desire to go forth from it they shall be brought back into it, and it will be said to them: Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie. And indeed We will make them taste of the Penalty of this (life) prior to the supreme Penalty, in order that they may (repent and) return. And verily We make them taste the lower punishment before the greater, that haply they may return. And most certainly We will make them taste of the nearer chastisement before the greater chastisement that haply they may turn. And who does more wrong than one to whom are recited the Signs of his Lord, and who then turns away therefrom? Verily from those who transgress We shall exact (due) Retribution. And who doth greater wrong than he who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord, then turneth from them. Lo! We shall requite the guilty. And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the communications of his Lord, then he turns away from them? Surely We will give punishment to the guilty. We did indeed aforetime give the Book to Moses: be not then in doubt of its reaching (thee): and We made it a guide to the Children of Israel. We verily gave Moses the Scripture; so be not ye in doubt of his receiving it; and We appointed it a guidance for the Children of Israel. And certainly We gave the Book to Musa, so be not in doubt concerning the receiving of it, and We made it a guide for the children of Israel. And We appointed, from among them, leaders, giving guidance under Our command, so long as they persevered with patience and continued to have faith in Our Signs. And when they became steadfast and believed firmly in Our revelations, We appointed from among them leaders who guided by Our command. And We made of them Imams to guide by Our command when they were patient, and they were certain of Our communications. Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, in the matters wherein they differ (among themselves). Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ. Surely your Lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they differ. Does it not teach them a lesson, how many generations We destroyed before them, in whose dwellings they (now) go to and fro? Verily in that are Signs: Do they not then listen? Is it not a guidance for them (to observe) how many generations We destroyed before them, amid whose dwelling places they do walk? Lo! therein verily are portents! Will they not then heed? Does it not point out to them the right way, how many of the generations, in whose abodes they go about, did We destroy before them? Most surely there are signs in this; will they not then hear? And do they not see that We do drive rain to parched soil (bare of herbage), and produce therewith crops, providing food for their cattle and themselves? Have they not the vision? Have they not seen how We lead the water to the barren land and therewith bring forth crops whereof their cattle eat, and they themselves? Will they not then see? Do they not see that We drive the water to a land having no herbage, then We bring forth thereby seed-produce of which their cattle and they themselves eat; will they not then see? They say: "When will this decision be, if ye are telling the truth?" And they say: When cometh this victory (of yours) if ye are truthful? And they say: When will this judgment take place, if you are truthful? Say: "On the Day of Decision, no profit will it be to Unbelievers if they (then) believe! nor will they be granted a respite." Say (unto them): On the day of the victory the faith of those who disbelieve (and who then will believe) will not avail them, neither will they be reprieved. Say: On the Day of Judgment the faith of those who (now) disbelieve will not profit them, nor will they be respited. So turn away from them, and wait: they too are waiting. So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), and await (the event). Lo! they (also) are awaiting (it). Therefore turn away from them and wait, surely they too are waiting."God. But any of you that is devout in the service of God and His Messenger, and works righteousness, to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance. And whosoever of you is submissive unto God and His messenger and does right, We shall give her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her a rich provision. And whoever of you is obedient to God and His Messenger and does good, We will give to her her reward doubly, and We have prepared for her an honorable sustenance.

O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the (other) women: if ye do fear (God), be not too complacent of speech, lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech (that is) just. O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like any other women. If ye keep your duty (to God), then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire (to you), but utter customary speech. O wives of the Prophet! you are not like any other of the women; If you will be on your guard, then be not soft in (your) speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease yearn; and speak a good word.

And stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity; and obey God and His Messenger. And God only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye Members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless. And stay in your houses. Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the Time of Ignorance. Be regular in prayer, and pay the poor-due, and obey God and His messenger. God's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O Folk of the Household, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing. And stay in your houses and do not display your finery like the displaying of the ignorance of yore; and keep up prayer, and pay the poor-rate, and obey God and His Messenger. God only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House! and to purify you a (thorough) purifying.

And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes, of the Signs of God and His Wisdom: for God understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted (with them). And bear in mind that which is recited in your houses of the revelations of God and wisdom. Lo! God is Subtile, Aware. And keep to mind what is recited in your houses of the communications of God and the wisdom; surely God is Knower of subtleties, Aware.

For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in Charity, for men and women who fast (and deny themselves), for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in God's praise, for them has God prepared forgiveness and great reward. Lo! men who surrender unto God, and women who surrender, and men who believe and women who believe, and men who obey and women who obey, and men who speak the truth and women who speak the truth, and men who persevere (in righteousness) and women who persevere, and men who are humble and women who are humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast and women who fast, and men who guard their modesty and women who guard (their modesty), and men who remember God much and women who remember - God hath prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward. Surely the men who submit and the women who submit, and the believing men and the believing women, and the obeying men and the obeying women, and the truthful men and the truthful women, and the patient men and the patient women and the humble men and the humble women, and the almsgiving men and the almsgiving women, and the fasting men and the fasting women, and the men who guard their private parts and the women who guard, and the men who remember God much and the women who remember God has prepared for them forgiveness and a mighty reward.

It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by God and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys God and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path. And it becometh not a believing man or a believing woman, when God and His messenger have decided an affair (for them), that they should (after that) claim any say in their affair; and whoso is rebellious to God and His messenger, he verily goeth astray in error manifest. And it behoves not a believing man and a believing woman that they should have any choice in their matter when God and His Messenger have decided a matter; and whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, he surely strays off a manifest straying.

Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of God and thy favour: "Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear God." But thou didst hide in thy heart that which God was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear God. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And God's command must be fulfilled. And when thou saidst unto him on whom God hath conferred favour and thou hast conferred favour: Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God. And thou didst hide in thy mind that which God was to bring to light, and thou didst fear mankind whereas God hath a better right that thou shouldst fear Him. So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them. The commandment of God must be fulfilled. And when you said to him to whom God had shown favor and to whom you had shown a favor: Keep your wife to yourself and be careful of (your duty to) God; and you concealed in your soul what God would bring to light, and you feared men, and God had a greater right that you should fear Him. But when Zaid had accomplished his want of her, We gave her to you as a wife, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their want of them; and God's command shall be performed.

There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what God has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of God amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of God is a decree determined. There is no reproach for the Prophet in that which God maketh his due. That was God's way with those who passed away of old - and the commandment of God is certain destiny. There is no harm in the Prophet doing that which God has ordained for him; such has been the course of God with respect to those who have gone before; and the command of God is a decree that is made absolute.

(It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of God, and fear Him, and fear none but God. And enough is God to call (men) to account. Who delivered the messages of God and feared Him, and feared none save God. God keepeth good account. Those who deliver the messages of God and fear Him, and do not fear any one but God; and God is sufficient to take account.

Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of God, and the Seal of the Prophets: and God has full knowledge of all things. Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets; and God is ever Aware of all things. Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of God and the Last of the prophets; and God is cognizant of all things.

O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of God, and do this often; O ye who believe! Remember God with much remembrance. O you who believe! remember God, remembering frequently,

And glorify Him morning and evening. And glorify Him early and late. And glorify Him morning and evening.

He it is Who sends blessings on you, as do His angels, that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness into Light: and He is Full of Mercy to the Believers. He it is Who blesseth you, and His angels (bless you), that He may bring you forth from darkness unto light; and He is ever Merciful to the believers. He it is Who sends His blessings on you, and (so do) His angels, that He may bring you forth out of utter darkness into the light; and He is Merciful to the believers.

Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be "Peace!"; and He has prepared for them a generous Reward. Their salutation on the day when they shall meet Him will be: Peace. And He hath prepared for them a goodly recompense. Their salutation on the day that they meet Him shall be, Peace, and He has prepared for them an honourable reward.

O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a Bearer of Glad Tidings, and Warner. O Prophet! Lo! We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner. O Prophet! surely We have sent you as a witness, and as a bearer of good news and as a warner,

And as one who invites to God's (grace) by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light. And as a summoner unto God by His permission, and as a lamp that giveth light. And as one inviting to God by His permission, and as a light-giving torch.

Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers, that they shall have from God a very great Bounty. And announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great bounty from God. And give to the believers the good news that they shall have a great grace from God.

And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and heed not their annoyances, but put thy Trust in God. For enough is God as a Disposer of affairs. And incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their noxious talk, and put thy trust in God. God is sufficient as Trustee. And be not compliant to the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and leave unregarded their annoying talk, and rely on God; and God is sufficient as a Protector.

O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have touched them, no period of 'Iddat have ye to count in respect of them."There were the believers sorely tried, and shaken with a mighty shock. And behold! The Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (even) say: "God and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!" And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, were saying: God and His messenger promised us naught but delusion. And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease began to say: God and His Messenger did not promise us (victory) but only to deceive. Behold! A party among them said: "Ye men of Yathrib! ye cannot stand (the attack)! therefore go back!" And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet, saying, "Truly our houses are bare and exposed," though they were not exposed they intended nothing but to run away. And when a party of them said: O folk of Yathrib! There is no stand (possible) for you, therefore turn back. And certain of them (even) sought permission of the Prophet, saying: Our homes lie open (to the enemy). And they lay not open. They but wished to flee. And when a party of them said: O people of Yasrib! there is no place to stand for you (here), therefore go back; and a party of them asked permission of the prophet, saying. Surely our houses are exposed; and they were not exposed; they only desired to fly away. And if an entry had been effected to them from the sides of the (city), and they had been incited to sedition, they would certainly have brought it to pass, with none but a brief delay! If the enemy had entered from all sides and they had been exhorted to treachery, they would have committed it, and would have hesitated thereupon but little. And if an entry were made upon them from the outlying parts of it, then they were asked to wage war, they would certainly have done it, and they would not have stayed in it but a little while. And yet they had already covenanted with God not to turn their backs, and a covenant with God must (surely) be answered for. And verily they had already sworn unto God that they would not turn their backs (to the foe). An oath to God must be answered for. And certainly they had made a covenant with God before, (that) they would not turn (their) backs; and God's covenant shall be inquired of. Say: "Running away will not profit you if ye are running away from death or slaughter; and even if (ye do escape), no more than a brief (respite) will ye be allowed to enjoy!" Say: Flight will not avail you if ye flee from death or killing, and then ye dwell in comfort but a little while. Say: Flight shall not do you any good if you fly from death or slaughter, and in that case you will not be allowed to enjoy yourselves but a little. Say: "Who is it that can screen you from God if it be His wish to give you punishment or to give you Mercy?" Nor will they find for themselves, besides God, any protector or helper. Say: Who is he who can preserve you from God if He intendeth harm for you, or intendeth mercy for you. They will not find that they have any friend or helper other than God. Say: Who is it that can withhold you from God if He intends to do you evil, rather He intends to show you mercy? And they will not find for themselves besides God any guardian or a helper. Verily God knows those among you who keep back (men) and those who say to their brethren, "Come along to us", but come not to the fight except for just a little while. God already knoweth those of you who hinder, and those who say unto their brethren: "Come ye hither unto us!" and they come not to the stress of battle save a little, God knows indeed those among you who hinder others and those who say to their brethren: Come to us; and they come not to the fight but a little, Covetous over you. Then when fear comes, thou wilt see them looking to thee, their eyes revolving, like (those of) one over whom hovers death: but when the fear is past, they will smite you with sharp tongues, covetous of goods. Such men have no faith, and so God has made their deeds of none effect: and that is easy for God. Being sparing of their help to you (believers). But when the fear cometh, then thou (Muhammad) seest them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death. Then, when the fear departeth, they scald you with sharp tongues in their greed for wealth (from the spoil). Such have not believed. Therefore God maketh their deeds fruitless. And that is easy for God. Being niggardly with respect to you; but when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes rolling like one swooning because of death; but when the fear is gone they smite you with sharp tongues, being niggardly of the good things. These have not believed, therefore God has made their doing naught; and this is easy to God. They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederates should come (again), they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the Bedouins, and seeking news about you (from a safe distance); and if they were in your midst, they would fight but little. They hold that the clans have not retired (for good); and if the clans should advance (again), they would fain be in the desert with the wandering Arabs, asking for the news of you; and if they were among you, they would not give battle, save a little. They think the allies are not gone, and if the allies should come (again) they would fain be in the deserts with the desert Arabs asking for news about you, and if they were among you they would not fight save a little. Ye have indeed in the Messenger of God a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in God and the Final Day, and who engages much in the Praise of God. Verily in the messenger of God ye have a good example for him who looketh unto God and the Last Day, and remembereth God much. Certainly you have in the Messenger of God an excellent exemplar for him who hopes in God and the latter day and remembers God much. When the Believers saw the Confederate forces, they said: "This is what God and his Messenger had promised us, and God and His Messenger told us what was true." And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience. And when the true believers saw the clans, they said: This is that which God and His messenger promised us. God and His messenger are true. It did but confirm them in their faith and resignation. And when the believers saw the allies, they said: This is what God and His Messenger promised us, and God and His Messenger spoke the truth; and it only increased them in faith and submission. Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with God: of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least: Of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted with God. Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still are waiting; and they have not altered in the least; Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with God: so of them is he who accomplished his vow, and of them is he who yet waits, and they have not changed in the least; That God may reward the men of Truth for their Truth, and punish the Hypocrites if that be His Will, or turn to them in Mercy: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. That God may reward the true men for their truth, and punish the hypocrites if He will, or relent toward them (if He will). Lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. That God may reward the truthful for their truth, and punish the hypocrites if He please or turn to them (mercifully); surely God is Forgiving, Merciful. And God turned back the Unbelievers for (all) their fury: no advantage did they gain; and enough is God for the believers in their fight. And God is full of Strength, able to enforce His Will. And God repulsed the disbelievers in their wrath; they gained no good. God averted their attack from the believers. God is ever Strong, Mighty. And God turned back the unbelievers in their rage; they did not obtain any advantage, and God sufficed the believers in fighting; and God is Strong, Mighty. And those of the People of the Book who aided them - God did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. (So that) some ye slew, and some ye made prisoners. And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye made captive some. And He drove down those of the followers of the Book who backed them from their fortresses and He cast awe into their hearts; some you killed and you took captive another part. And He made you heirs of their lands, their houses, and their goods, and of a land which ye had not frequented (before). And God has power over all things. And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth, and land ye have not trodden. God is ever Able to do all things. And He made you heirs to their land and their dwellings and their property, and (to) a land which you have not yet trodden, and God has power over all things. O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts: "If it be that ye desire the life of this World, and its glitter,- then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and set you free in a handsome manner." O Prophet! Say unto thy wives: If ye desire the world's life and its adornment, come! I will content you and will release you with a fair release. O Prophet! say to your wives: If you desire this world's life and its adornment, then come, I will give you a provision and allow you to depart a goodly departing; But if ye seek God and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, verily God has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward. But if ye desire God and His messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then lo! God hath prepared for the good among you an immense reward. And if you desire God and His Messenger and the latter abode, then surely God has prepared for the doers of good among you a mighty reward. O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct, the Punishment would be doubled to her, and that is easy for God. O ye wives of the Prophet! Whosoever of you committeth manifest lewdness, the punishment for her will be doubled, and that is easy for God. O wives of the prophet! whoever of you commits an open indecency, the punishment shall be increased to her doubly; and this is easy toO Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom God has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her. This is only for thee, and not for the Believers at large. We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess, in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Thou mayest defer the turn of any of them that thou pleasest, and thou mayest receive any thou pleasest: and there is no blame on thee if thou invite one whose turn thou hadst set aside. This is nigher to the cooling of their eyes, the prevention of their grief, and their satisfaction with what thou hast to give them. God knows what is in your hearts: and God is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.

It is not lawful for thee to marry more women after this, nor to change them for other wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thy right hand should possess. And God doth watch over all things.

O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses until leave is given you for a meal, not so early as to wait for its preparation. When ye are invited, enter; and when ye have taken your meal, disperse, without seeking familiar talk. Such behavior annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss you, but God is not ashamed to tell you the truth. When ye ask his ladies for anything, ask them from behind a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you to annoy God's Messenger, or to marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in God's sight an enormity.

Whether ye reveal anything or conceal it, verily God has full knowledge of all things.

There is no blame on these ladies if they appear before their fathers or their sons, their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess. And, ladies, fear God; for God is Witness to all things.

God and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect.

Those who annoy God and His Messenger, God has cursed them in this World and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating Punishment.

And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, bear on themselves a calumny and a glaring sin.

O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons when abroad: that is most convenient, that they should be known as such and not molested. And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbors for any length of time. They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain without mercy. But any of you that is devout in the service of God and His Messenger, and works righteousness, to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance. O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the (other) women: if ye do fear (God), be not too complacent of speech, lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech (that is) just. And stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity; and obey God and His Messenger. And God only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye Members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless. And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes, of the Signs of God and His Wisdom: for God understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted (with them). For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in Charity, for men and women who fast, for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in God's praise, for them has God prepared forgiveness and great reward. It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by God and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys God and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path. Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of God and thy favour: 'Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear God.' But thou didst hide in thy heart that which God was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear God. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And God's command must be fulfilled. There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what God has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of God amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of God is a decree determined. (It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of God, and fear Him, and fear none but God. And enough is God to call (men) to account. Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of God, and the Seal of the Prophets: and God has full knowledge of all things. O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of God, and do this often; and glorify Him morning and evening. He it is Who sends blessings on you, as do His angels, that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness into Light: and He is Full of Mercy to the Believers. Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be 'Peace!'; and He has prepared for them a generous Reward. O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a Bearer of Glad Tidings, and Warner, and as one who invites to God's (grace) by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light. Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers, that they shall have from God a very great Bounty. And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and heed not their annoyances, but put thy Trust in God. For enough is God as a Disposer of affairs. O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have touched them, no period of 'Iddat have ye to count in respect of them."of God among those who lived aforetime: No change wilt thou find in the practice of God. That was the way of God in the case of those who passed away of old; thou wilt not find for the way of God aught of power to change.

Men ask thee concerning the Hour: Say, "The knowledge thereof is with God alone": and what will make thee understand? Perchance the Hour is nigh! Men ask thee of the Hour. Say: The knowledge of it is with God only. What can convey the knowledge unto thee? It may be that the Hour is nigh. Men ask you about the hour; say: The knowledge of it is only with God, and what will make you comprehend that the hour may be nigh.

Verily God has cursed the Unbelievers and prepared for them a Blazing Fire, to dwell therein forever: no protector will they find, nor helper. The Day that their faces will be turned upside down in the Fire, they will say: "Woe to us! Would that we had obeyed God and obeyed the Messenger!" And they would say: "Our Lord! We obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they misled us as to the right Path." "Our Lord! Give them double Penalty and curse them with a very great Curse!"

O ye who believe! Be ye not like those who vexed and insulted Moses, but God cleared him of the calumnies they had uttered: and he was honorable in God's sight. O ye who believe! Fear God, and always say a word directed to the Right: That He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He that obeys God and His Messenger has already attained the highest achievement.

We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof: but man undertook it; he was indeed unjust and foolish. With the result that God has to punish the Hypocrites, men and women, and the Unbelievers, men and women, and God turns in Mercy to the Believers, men and women: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Chapter 34: SABA (SABA, SHEBA)
Total Verses: 54
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, to Whom belong all things in the heavens and on earth: to Him be Praise in the Hereafter: and He is Full of Wisdom, acquainted with all things. He knows all that goes into the earth, and all that comes out thereof; all that comes down from the sky and all that ascends thereto and He is the Most Merciful, the Oft-Forgiving.

The Unbelievers say, "Never to us will come the Hour": Say, "Nay! but most surely, by my Lord, it will come upon you; by Him Who knows the unseen; from Whom is not hidden the least little atom in the heavens or on earth: Nor is there anything less than that, or greater, but is in the Record Perspicuous." That He may reward those who believe and work deeds of righteousness: for such is Forgiveness and a Sustenance Most Generous. But those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them, for such will be a Penalty, a Punishment most humiliating.

And those to whom knowledge has come see that the Revelation sent down to thee from thy Lord is the Truth, and that it guides to the Path of the Exalted in might, Worthy of all praise. The Unbelievers say in ridicule: "Shall we point out to you a man that will tell you, when ye are all scattered to pieces in disintegration, that ye shall then be raised in a New Creation?" Has he invented a falsehood against God, or has a spirit seized him? Nay, it is those who believe not in the Hereafter, that are in real Penalty, and in farthest error.

See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turns to God in repentance.

We bestowed Grace aforetime on David from ourselves: "O ye Mountains! Sing ye back the Praises of God with him! and ye birds also! And We made the iron soft for him." Commanding, "Make thou coats of mail, balancing well the rings of chain armor, and work ye righteousness; for be sure I see clearly all that ye do.""espect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner. O ye who believe! If ye wed believing women and divorce them before ye have touched them, then there is no period that ye should reckon. But content them and release them handsomely. O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom God has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her; this only for thee, and not for the Believers at large; We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess; in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Thou mayest defer the turn of any of them that thou pleasest, and thou mayest receive any thou pleasest: and there is no blame on thee if thou invite one whose turn thou hadst set aside. This were nigher to the cooling of their eyes, the prevention of their grief, and their satisfaction with that which thou hast to give them: and God knows all that is in your hearts: and God is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. It is not lawful for thee to marry more women after this, nor to change them for other wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thy right hand should possess: and God doth watch over all things. O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses until leave is given you for a meal, and then not so early as to wait for its preparation: but when ye are invited, enter; and when ye have taken your meal, disperse, without seeking familiar talk. Such behavior annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss you, but God is not ashamed to tell you the truth. And when ye ask his ladies for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy God's Messenger, or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in God's sight an enormity. Whether ye reveal anything or conceal it, verily God has full knowledge of all things. There is no blame on these ladies if they appear before their fathers or their sons, their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess. And, ladies, fear God; for God is Witness to all things. God and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect. Those who annoy God and His Messenger, God has cursed them in this World and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating Punishment. And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, bear on themselves a calumny and a glaring sin. O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons when abroad: that is most convenient, that they should be known as such and not molested. And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbors for any length of time: They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain without mercy. Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a fierce slaughter."And to Solomon (We made) the Wind (obedient): Its early morning (stride) was a month's (journey), and its evening (stride) was a month's (journey); and We made a Font of molten brass to flow for him; and there were jinns that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord, and if any of them turned aside from Our command, We made him taste of the Penalty of the Blazing Fire.

They worked for him as he desired, making Arches, Images, Basins as large as Reservoirs, and cooking Cauldrons fixed in their places: "Work ye, sons of David, with thanks! but few of My servants are grateful!"

Then, when We decreed Solomon's death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the jinns saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty of their Task.

There was, for Saba, aforetime, a Sign in their homeland - two Gardens to the right and to the left. "Eat of the Sustenance provided by your Lord, and be grateful to Him: a territory fair and happy, and a Lord Oft-Forgiving!"

But they turned away from God, and We sent against them the Flood released from the dams, and We converted their two garden rows into gardens producing bitter fruit, tamarisks, and some few stunted Lote-trees.

That was the Requital We gave them because they ungratefully rejected Faith: and never do We give such requital except to such as are ungrateful rejecters.

Between them and the Cities on which We had poured our blessings, We had placed Cities in prominent positions, and between them We had appointed stages of journey in due proportion: "Travel therein, secure, by night and by day."

But they said: "Our Lord! Place longer distances between our journey-stages": but they wronged themselves therein. At length We made them as a tale that is told, and We dispersed them all in scattered fragments. Verily in this are Signs for every soul that is patiently constant and grateful.

And on them did Satan prove true his idea, and they followed him, all but a party that believed.

But he had no authority over them, except that We might test the man who believes in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt concerning it: and thy Lord doth watch over all things.

Say: "Call upon other gods whom ye fancy, besides God: They have no power, not the weight of an atom, in the heavens or on earth: No sort of share have they therein, nor is any of them a helper to God."

No intercession can avail in His Presence, except for those for whom He has granted permission. So far is this the case that, when terror is removed from their hearts at the Day of Judgment, then will they say, 'What is it that your Lord commanded?' they will say, 'That which is true and just'; and He is the Most High, Most Great.

Say: "Who gives you sustenance, from the heavens and the earth?" Say: "It is God; and certain it is that either we or ye are on right guidance or in manifest error!"

Say: "Ye shall not be questioned as to our sins, nor shall we be questioned as to what ye do."

Say: "Our Lord will gather us together and will in the end decide the matter between us and you in truth and justice: and He is the one to decide, the One Who knows all."

Say: "Show me those whom ye have joined with Him as partners: by no means can ye. Nay, He is God, the Exalted in Power, the Wise."

We have not sent thee but as a universal Messenger to men, giving them glad tidings, and warning them against sin, but most men understand not.

They say: "When will this promise come to pass if ye are telling the truth?"

Say: "The appointment to you is for a Day, which ye cannot put back for an hour nor put forward."

The Unbelievers say: "We shall neither believe in this scripture nor in any that came before it." Couldst thou but see when the wrong-doers will be made to stand before their Lord, throwing back the word of blame on one another! Those who had been despised will say to the arrogant ones: "Had it not been for...of God among those who lived aforetime: No change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of God. That was the way of God in the case of those who passed away of old; thou wilt not find for the way of God aught of power to change. Men ask thee concerning the Hour: Say, 'The knowledge thereof is with God (alone)': and what will make thee understand?- perchance the Hour is nigh! Men ask thee of the Hour. Say: The knowledge of it is with God only. What can convey (the knowledge) unto thee? It may be that the Hour is nigh. Men ask you about the hour; say: The knowledge of it is only with God, and what will make you comprehend that the hour may be nigh. Verily God has cursed the Unbelievers and prepared for them a Blazing Fire, to dwell therein forever: no protector will they find, nor helper. Wherein they will abide forever. They will find (then) no protecting friend nor helper. To abide therein for a long time; they shall not find a protector or a helper. The Day that their faces will be turned upside down in the Fire, they will say: 'Woe to us! Would that we had obeyed God and obeyed the Messenger!' On the day when their faces are turned over in the Fire, they say: Oh, would that we had obeyed God and had obeyed His messenger! On the day when their faces shall be turned back into the fire, they shall say: O would that we had obeyed God and obeyed the Messenger! And they would say: 'Our Lord! We obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they misled us as to the (right) Path.' And they say: Our Lord! Lo! we obeyed our princes and great men, and they misled us from the Way. And they shall say: O our Lord! surely we obeyed our leaders and our great men, so they led us astray from the path; 'Our Lord! Give them double Penalty and curse them with a very great Curse!' Our Lord! Oh, give them double torment and curse them with a mighty curse. O ye who believe! Be ye not like those who vexed and insulted Moses, but God cleared him of the (calumnies) they had uttered: and he was honorable in God's sight. O ye who believe! Be not as those who slandered Moses, but God proved his innocence of that which they alleged, and he was well esteemed in God's sight. O you who believe! be not like those who spoke evil things of Musa, but God cleared him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with God. O ye who believe! Fear God, and (always) say a word directed to the Right: O ye who believe! Guard your duty to God, and speak words straight to the point; O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) God and speak the right word, That He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He that obeys God and His Messenger, has already attained the highest achievement. He will adjust your works for you and will forgive you your sins. Whosoever obeyeth God and His messenger, he verily hath gained a signal victory. He will put your deeds into a right state for you, and forgive you your faults; and whoever obeys God and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty success. We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof: but man undertook it;- He was indeed unjust and foolish; Lo! We offered the trust unto the heavens and the earth and the hills, but they shrank from bearing it and were afraid of it. And man assumed it. Lo! he hath proved a tyrant and a fool. Surely We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to be unfaithful to it and feared from it, and man has turned unfaithful to it; surely he is unjust, ignorant; (With the result) that God has to punish the Hypocrites, men and women, and the Unbelievers, men and women, and God turns in Mercy to the Believers, men and women: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. So God punisheth hypocritical men and hypocritical women, and idolatrous men and idolatrous women. But God pardoneth believing men and believing women, and God is ever Forgiving, Merciful. So God will chastise the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the polytheistic men and the polytheistic women, and God will turn (mercifully) to the believing women, and God is Forgiving, Merciful. - Chapter 34: SABA (SABA, SHEBA) Total Verses: 54 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God, to Whom belong all things in the heavens and on earth: to Him be Praise in the Hereafter: and He is Full of Wisdom, acquainted with all things. Praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. His is the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the Wise, the Aware. (All) praise is due to God, Whose is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and to Him is due (all) praise in the hereafter; and He is the Wise, the Aware. He knows all that goes into the earth, and all that comes out thereof; all that comes down from the sky and all that ascends thereto and He is the Most Merciful, the Oft-Forgiving. He knoweth that which goeth into the earth and that which cometh forth from it, and that descendeth from the heaven and that which ascendeth into it. He is the Merciful, the Forgiving. He knows that which goes down into the earth and that which comes out of it, and that which comes down from the heaven and that goes up to it; and He is the Merciful, the Forgiving. The Unbelievers say, 'Never to us will come the Hour': Say, 'Nay! but most surely, by my Lord, it will come upon you;- by Him Who knows the unseen,- from Whom is not hidden the least little atom in the heavens or on earth: Nor is there anything less than that, or greater, but is in the Record Perspicuous:' Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay, by my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the Knower of the Unseen. Not an atom's weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth, but it is in a clear Record, And those who disbelieve say: The hour shall not come upon us. Say: Yea! by my Lord, the Knower of the unseen, it shall certainly come upon you; not the weight of an atom becomes absent from Him, in the heavens or in the earth, and neither less than that nor greater, but (all) is in a clear book, 'That He may reward those who believe and work deeds of righteousness: for such is Forgiveness and a Sustenance Most Generous.' That He may reward those who believe and do good works. For them is pardon and a rich provision. That He may reward those who believe and do good; these it is for whom is forgiveness and an honorable sustenance. But those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them,- for such will be a Penalty,- a Punishment most humiliating. But those who strive against Our revelations, challenging (Us), theirs will be a painful doom of wrath. And (as for) those who strive hard in opposing Our communications, these it is for whom is a painful chastisement of an evil kind. And those to whom knowledge has come see that the (Revelation) sent down to thee from thy Lord - that is the Truth, and that it guides to the Path of the Exalted (in might), Worthy of all praise. Those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth and leadeth unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of Praise. And those to whom the knowledge has been given see that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, that is the truth, and it guides into the path of the Mighty, the Praised. The Unbelievers say (in ridicule): 'Shall we point out to you a man that will tell you, when ye are all scattered to pieces in disintegration, that ye shall (then be raised) in a New Creation?' Those who disbelieve say: Shall we show you a man who will tell you (that) when ye have become dispersed in dust with most complete dispersal still, even then, ye will be created anew? And those who disbelieve say: Shall we point out to you a man who informs you that when you are scattered the utmost scattering you shall then be most surely (raised) in (to) a new creation? 'Has he invented a falsehood against God, or has a spirit (seized) him?'- Nay, it is those who believe not in the Hereafter, that are in (real) Penalty, and in farthest error. Hath he invented a lie concerning God, or is there in him a madness? Nay, but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are in torment and far error. He has forged a lie against God or there is madness in him. Nay! those who do not believe in the hereafter are in torment and in great error. See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turns to God (in repentance). Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the sky and the earth? If We will, We can make the earth swallow them, or cause obliteration from the sky to fall on them. Lo! herein surely is a portent for every slave who turneth (to God) repentant. Do they not then consider what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We please We will make them disappear in the land or bring down upon them a portion from the heaven; most surely there is a sign in this for every servant turning (to God). We bestowed Grace aforetime on David from ourselves: 'O ye Mountains! Sing ye back the Praises of God with him! and ye birds (also)! And We made the iron soft for him;' And assuredly We gave David grace from Us, (saying): O ye hills and birds, echo his psalms of praise! And We made the iron supple unto him, And certainly We gave to Dawood excellence from Us: O mountains! sing praises with him, and the birds; and We made the iron pliant to him, (Commanding), 'Make thou coats of mail, balancing well the rings of chain armor, and work ye righteousness; for be sure I see (clearly) all that ye do.' Saying: Make thou long coats of mail and measure the links (thereof). And do ye right. Lo! I am Seer of what ye do. Saying: Make ample (coats of mail), and assign a time to the making of coats of mail and do good; surely I am Seeing w""you, we should certainly have been believers!" And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that which was before it; but oh, if thou couldst see, when the wrong-doers are brought up before their Lord, how they cast the blame one to another; how those who were despised (in the earth) say unto those who were proud: But for you, we should have been believers. And those who disbelieve say: By no means will we believe in this Quran, nor in that which is before it; and could you see when the unjust shall be made to stand before their Lord, bandying words one with another! Those who were reckoned weak shall say to those who were proud: Had it not been for you we would certainly have been believers. The arrogant ones will say to those who had been despised: "Was it we who kept you back from Guidance after it reached you? Nay, rather, it was ye who transgressed." Those who were proud say unto those who were despised: Did we drive you away from the guidance after it had come unto you? Nay, but ye were guilty. Those who were proud shall say to those who were deemed weak: Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you? Nay, you (yourselves) were guilty. Those who had been despised will say to the arrogant ones: "Nay! it was a plot (of yours) by day and by night: Behold! Ye (constantly) ordered us to be ungrateful to God and to attribute equals to Him!" They will declare (their) repentance when they see the Penalty: We shall put yokes on the necks of the Unbelievers: It would only be a requital for their (ill) Deeds. Those who were despised say unto those who were proud: Nay but (it was your) scheming night and day, when ye commanded us to disbelieve in God and set up rivals unto Him. And they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom; and We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught save what they used to do? And those who were deemed weak shall say to those who were proud. Nay, (it was) planning by night and day when you told us to disbelieve in God and to set up likes with Him. And they shall conceal regret when they shall see the punishment; and We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved; they shall not be requited but what they did. Never did We send a warner to a population, but the wealthy ones among them said: "We believe not in the (Message) with which ye have been sent." And We sent not unto any township a warner, but its pampered ones declared: Lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent. And We never sent a warner to a town but those who led lives in ease in it said: We are surely disbelievers in what you are sent with. They said: "We have more in wealth and in sons, and we cannot be punished." And they say: We are more (than you) in wealth and children. We are not the punished! And they say: We have more wealth and children, and we shall not be punished. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Provision to whom He pleases, but most men understand not." Say (O Muhammad): Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will and narroweth it (for whom He will). But most of mankind know not. Say: Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and straitens (for whom He pleases), but most men do not know. It is not your wealth nor your sons, that will bring you nearer to Us in degree: but only those who believe and work righteousness - these are the ones for whom there is a multiplied Reward for their deeds, while secure they (reside) in the dwellings on high! And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto Us, but he who believeth and doeth good (he draweth near). As for such, theirs will be twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty halls. And not your wealth nor your children, are the things which bring you near Us in station, but whoever believes and does good, these it is for whom is a double reward for what they do, and they shall be secure in the highest places. Those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them, will be given over into Punishment. And as for those who strive against Our revelations, challenging, they will be brought to the doom. And (as for) those who strive in opposing Our communications, they shall be caused to be brought to the chastisement. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Sustenance to such of his servants as He pleases: and nothing do ye spend in the least (in His cause) but He replaces it: for He is the Best of those who grant Sustenance." Say: Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen, and narroweth (it) for him. And whatsoever ye spend (for good) He replaceth it. And He is the Best of Providers. Say: Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants and straitens (them) for whom (He pleases), and whatever thing you spend, He exceeds it in reward, and He is the best of Sustainers. One Day He will gather them all together, and say to the angels, "Was it you that these men used to worship?" And on the day when He will gather them all together, He will say unto the angels: Did these worship you? And on the day when He will gather them all together, then will He say to the angels: Did these worship you? They will say, "Glory to Thee! our (tie) is with Thee - as Protector - not with them. Nay, but they worshipped the jinns: most of them believed in them." They will say: Be Thou Glorified. Thou (alone) art our Guardian, not them! Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them. They shall say: Glory be to Thee! Thou art our Guardian, not they; nay! they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them. So on that Day no power shall they have over each other, for profit or harm: and We shall say to the wrong-doers, "Taste ye the Penalty of the Fire,- the which ye were wont to deny!" That day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another. And We shall say unto those who did wrong: Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny. So on that day one of you shall not control profit or harm for another, and We will say to those who were unjust: Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie. When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, they say, "This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from the (worship) which your fathers practised." And they say, "This is only a falsehood invented!" and the Unbelievers say of the Truth when it comes to them, "This is nothing but evident magic!" And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms, they say: This is naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to worship; and they say: This is naught else than an invented lie. Those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them: This is naught else than mere magic. And when Our clear communications are recited to them, they say: This is naught but a man who desires to turn you away from that which your fathers worshipped. And they say: This is naught but a lie that is forged. And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them: This is only clear enchantment. But We had not given them Books which they could study, nor sent messengers to them before thee as Warners. And We have given them no scriptures which they study, nor sent We unto them, before thee, any warner. And We have not given them any books which they read, nor did We send to them before you a warner. And their predecessors rejected (the Truth); these have not received a tenth of what We had granted to those: yet when they rejected My messengers, how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)! Those before them denied, and these have not attained a tithe of that which We bestowed on them (of old); yet they denied My messengers. How intense then was My abhorrence (of them)! And those before them rejected (the truth), and these have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave them, but they gave the lie to My messengers, then how was the manifestation of My disapproval? Say: "I do admonish you on one point: that ye do stand up before God,- (It may be) in pairs, or (it may be) singly,- and reflect (within yourselves): your Companion is not possessed: he is no less than a warner to you, in face of a terrible Penalty." Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I exhort you unto one thing only: that ye awake, for God's sake, by twos and singly, and then reflect: There is no madness in your comrade. He is naught else than a warner unto you in face of a terrific doom. Say: I exhort you only to one thing, that rise up for God's sake in twos and singly, then ponder: there is no madness in your fellow-citizen; he is only a warner to you before a severe chastisement. Say: "No reward do I ask of you: it is (all) in your interest: my reward is only due from God: And He is witness to all things." Say: Whatever reward I might have asked of you is yours. My reward is the affair of God only. He is Witness over all things. Say: Whatever reward I have asked of you, that is only for yourselves; my reward is only with God, and He is a witness of all things. Say: "Verily my Lord doth cast the (mantle of) Truth (over His servants),- He that has full knowledge of (all) that is hidden." Say: Lo! my Lord hurleth the truth. (He is) the Knower of Things Hidden. Say: Surely my Lord utters the truth, the great Knower of the unseen. Say: "The Truth has arrived, and Falsehood neither creates anything new, nor restores anything." Say: The Truth hath come, and falsehood showeth not its face and will not return. Say: The truth has come, and the falsehood shall vanish and shall not come back. Say: "If I am astray, I only stray to the loss of my own soul: but if I receive guidance, it is because of the inspiration of my Lord to me: it is He Who hears all things, and is (ever) near." Say: If I err, I err only to my own loss, and if I am rightly guided it is because of that which my Lord hath revealed unto me. Lo! He is Hearer, Nigh. Say: If I err, I err only against my own soul, and if I follow a right direction, it is because of what my Lord reveals to me; surely He is Hearing, Nigh. If thou couldst but see when they will quake with terror; but then there will be no escape (for them), and they will be seized from a position (quite) near. Couldst thou but see when they are terrified with no escape, and are seized from near at hand, And could you see when they shall become terrified, but (then) there shall be no escape and they shall be seized upon from a near place, And they will say, "We do believe (now) in the (Truth)"; but how could they receiveAnd to Solomon (We made) the Wind (obedient): Its early morning (stride) was a month's (journey), and its evening (stride) was a month's (journey); and We made a Font of molten brass to flow for him; and there were jinns that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord, and if any of them turned aside from Our command, We made him taste of the Penalty of the Blazing Fire. They worked for him as he desired, making Arches, Images, Basins as large as Reservoirs, and cooking Cauldrons fixed in their places: "Work ye, sons of David, with thanks! but few of My servants are grateful!" Then, when We decreed Solomon's death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the jinns saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty of their Task. There was, for Saba, aforetime, a Sign in their homeland - two Gardens to the right and to the left. "Eat of the Sustenance provided by your Lord, and be grateful to Him: a territory fair and happy, and a Lord Oft-Forgiving!" But they turned away from God, and We sent against them the Flood released from the dams, and We converted their two garden rows into gardens producing bitter fruit, and tamarisks, and some few stunted Lote-trees. That was the Requital We gave them because they ungratefully rejected Faith: and never do We give such requital except to such as are ungrateful rejecters. Between them and the Cities on which We had poured our blessings, We had placed Cities in prominent positions, and between them We had appointed stages of journey in due proportion: "Travel therein, secure, by night and by day."

At length We made them as a tale that is told, and We dispersed them all in scattered fragments. Verily in this are Signs for every soul that is patiently constant and grateful.

No intercession can avail in His Presence, except for those for whom He has granted permission.

Say: "Our Lord will gather us together and will in the end decide the matter between us and you in truth and justice: and He is the one to decide, the One Who knows all." Say: "Show me those whom ye have joined with Him as partners: by no means can ye. Nay, He is God, the Exalted in Power, the Wise." We have not sent thee but as a universal Messenger to men, giving them glad tidings, and warning them against sin, but most men understand not. They say: "When will this promise come to pass if ye are telling the truth?" Say: "The appointment to you is for a Day, which ye cannot put back for an hour nor put forward." The Unbelievers say: "We shall neither believe in this scripture nor in any that came before it." Couldst thou but see when the wrong-doers will be made to stand before their Lord, throwing back the word of blame on one another! Those who had been despised will say to the arrogant ones: "Had it not been for..."Those who disbelieve say: 'We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that which was before it.' But if you could see when the wrong-doers are brought before their Lord, how they cast the blame on one another! Those who were despised will say to the arrogant ones: 'Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers!' The arrogant ones will reply: 'Was it we who kept you back from Guidance after it reached you? Nay, rather, it was you who transgressed.' Those who had been despised will say: 'Nay! It was a plot of yours by day and by night: You constantly ordered us to be ungrateful to God and to attribute equals to Him!' They will declare their repentance when they see the Penalty: We shall put yokes on the necks of the Unbelievers: It would only be a requital for their deeds. Never did We send a warner to a population, but the wealthy ones among them said: 'We believe not in the Message with which you have been sent.' They said: 'We have more in wealth and in sons, and we cannot be punished.' Say: 'Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Provision to whom He pleases, but most men understand not.' It is not your wealth nor your sons that will bring you nearer to Us in degree: but only those who believe and work righteousness - these are the ones for whom there is a multiplied Reward for their deeds, while secure they reside in the dwellings on high! Those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them, will be given over into Punishment. Say: 'Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Sustenance to such of His servants as He pleases: and nothing do you spend in the least in His cause but He replaces it: for He is the Best of those who grant Sustenance.' One Day He will gather them all together, and say to the angels, 'Was it you that these men used to worship?' They will say, 'Glory to You! Our tie is with You - as Protector - not with them. Nay, but they worshipped the jinns: most of them believed in them.' So on that Day no power shall they have over each other, for profit or harm: and We shall say to the wrong-doers, 'Taste the Penalty of the Fire, which you were wont to deny!' When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, they say, 'This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from the worship which your fathers practiced.' And they say, 'This is only a falsehood invented!' and the Unbelievers say of the Truth when it comes to them, 'This is nothing but evident magic!' But We had not given them Books which they could study, nor sent messengers to them before you as Warners. And their predecessors rejected the Truth; these have not received a tenth of what We had granted to those: yet when they rejected My messengers, how terrible was My rejection of them! Say: 'I do admonish you on one point: that you do stand up before God, in pairs or singly, and reflect within yourselves: your Companion is not possessed: he is no less than a warner to you, in face of a terrible Penalty.' Say: 'No reward do I ask of you: it is all in your interest: my reward is only due from God: And He is witness to all things.' Say: 'Verily my Lord casts the mantle of Truth over His servants, He that has full knowledge of all that is hidden.' Say: 'The Truth has arrived, and Falsehood neither creates anything new, nor restores anything.' Say: 'If I am astray, I only stray to the loss of my own soul: but if I receive guidance, it is because of the inspiration of my Lord to me: it is He Who hears all things, and is ever near.' If you could see when they will quake with terror; but then there will be no escape for them, and they will be seized from a position quite near. And they will say, 'We do believe now in the Truth'; but how could they receive it?""Faith) from a position (so) far off,- P: And say: We (now) believe therein. But how can they reach (faith) from afar off, S: And they shall say: We believe in it. And how shall the attaining (of faith) be possible to them from a distant place? 034.053 Y: Seeing that they did reject Faith (entirely) before, and that they (continually) cast (slanders) on the unseen from a position far off? P: When they disbelieved in it of yore. They aim at the unseen from afar off. S: And they disbelieved in it before, and they utter conjectures with regard to the unseen from a distant place. 034.054 Y: And between them and their desires, is placed a barrier, as was done in the past with their partisans: for they were indeed in suspicious (disquieting) doubt. P: And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire, as was done for people of their kind of old. Lo! they were in hopeless doubt. S: And a barrier shall be placed between them and that which they desire, as was done with the likes of them before: surely they are in a disquieting doubt. - Chapter 35: FATIR (THE ANGELS, ORIGINATOR) Total Verses: 45 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 035.001 Y: Praise be to God, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels, messengers with wings,- two, or three, or four (pairs): He adds to Creation as He pleases: for God has power over all things. P: Praise be to God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who appointeth the angels messengers having wings two, three and four. He multiplieth in creation what He will. Lo! God is Able to do all things. S: All praise is due to God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Maker of the angels, messengers flying on wings, two, and three, and four; He increases in creation what He pleases; surely God has power over all things. 035.002 Y: What God out of his Mercy doth bestow on mankind there is none can withhold: what He doth withhold, there is none can grant, apart from Him: and He is the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. P: That which God openeth unto mankind of mercy none can withhold it; and that which He withholdeth none can release thereafter. He is the Mighty, the Wise. S: Whatever God grants to men of (His) mercy, there is none to withhold it, and what He withholds there is none to send it forth after that, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. 035.003 Y: O men! Call to mind the grace of God unto you! is there a creator, other than God, to give you sustenance from heaven or earth? There is no god but He: how then are ye deluded away from the Truth? P: O mankind! Remember God's grace toward you! Is there any creator other than God who provideth for you from the sky and the earth? There is no God save Him. Whither then are ye turned? S: O men! call to mind the favor of God on you; is there any creator besides God who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? There is no god but He; whence are you then turned away? 035.004 Y: And if they reject thee, so were messengers rejected before thee: to God go back for decision all affairs. P: And if they deny thee, (O Muhammad), messengers (of God) were denied before thee. Unto God all things are brought back. S: And if they call you a liar, truly messengers before you were called liars, and to God are all affairs returned. 035.005 Y: O men! Certainly the promise of God is true. Let not then this present life deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver deceive you about God. P: O mankind! Lo! the promise of God is true. So let not the life of the world beguile you, and let not the (avowed) beguiler beguile you with regard to God. S: O men! surely the promise of God is true, therefore let not the life of this world deceive you, and let not the archdeceiver deceive you respecting God. 035.006 Y: Verily Satan is an enemy to you: so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his adherents, that they may become Companions of the Blazing Fire. P: Lo! the devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy. He only summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming Fire. S: Surely the Shaitan is your enemy, so take him for an enemy; he only invites his party that they may be inmates of the burning fire. 035.007 Y: For those who reject God, is a terrible Penalty: but for those who believe and work righteous deeds, is Forgiveness, and a magnificent Reward. P: Those who disbelieve, theirs will be an awful doom; and those who believe and do good works, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward. S: (As for) those who disbelieve, they shall have a severe punishment, and (as for) those who believe and do good, they shall have forgiveness and a great reward. 035.008 Y: Is he, then, to whom the evil of his conduct is made alluring, so that he looks upon it as good, (equal to one who is rightly guided)? For God leaves to stray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. So let not thy soul go out in (vainly) sighing after them: for God knows well all that they do! P: Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it good, (other than Satan's dupe)? God verily sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will; so let not thy soul expire in sighings for them. Lo! God is Aware of what they do! S: What! is he whose evil deed is made fairseeming to him so much so that he considers it good? Now surely God makes err whom He pleases and guides aright whom He pleases, so let not your soul waste away in grief for them; surely God is Cognizant of what they do. 035.009 Y: It is God Who sends forth the Winds, so that they raise up the Clouds, and We drive them to a land that is dead, and revive the earth therewith after its death: even so (will be) the Resurrection! P: And God it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead it unto a dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death. Such is the Resurrection. S: And God is He Who sends the winds so they raise a cloud, then We drive it on to a dead country, and therewith We give life to the earth after its death; even so is the quickening. 035.010 Y: If any do seek for glory and power,- to God belong all glory and power. To Him mount up (all) Words of Purity: It is He Who exalts each Deed of Righteousness. Those that lay Plots of Evil,- for them is a Penalty terrible; and the plotting of such will be void (of result). P: Whoso desireth power (should know that) all power belongeth to God. Unto Him good words ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt; but those who plot iniquities, theirs will be an awful doom; and the plotting of such (folk) will come to naught. S: Whoever desires honor, then to God belongs the honor wholly. To Him do ascend the good words; and the good deeds, lift them up, and (as for) those who plan evil deeds, they shall have a severe chastisement; and (as for) their plan, it shall perish. 035.011 Y: And God did create you from dust; then from a sperm-drop; then He made you in pairs. And no female conceives, or lays down (her load), but with His knowledge. Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days, nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Decree (ordained). All this is easy to God. P: God created you from dust, then from a little fluid, then He made you pairs (the male and female). No female beareth or bringeth forth save with His knowledge. And no-one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his life, but it is recorded in a Book, Lo! that is easy for God. S: And God created you of dust, then of the life-germ, then He made you pairs; and no female bears, nor does she bring forth, except with His knowledge; and no one whose life is lengthened has his life lengthened, nor is aught diminished of one's life, but it is all in a book; surely this is easy to God. 035.012 Y: Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike,- the one palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, and the other, salt and bitter. Yet from each (kind of water) do ye eat flesh fresh and tender, and ye extract ornaments to wear; and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves, that ye may seek (thus) of the Bounty of God that ye may be grateful. P: And the two seas are not alike: this, fresh, sweet, good to drink, this (other) bitter, salt. And from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the ornament that ye wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye may give thanks. S: And the two seas are not alike: the one sweet, that subdues thirst by its excessive sweetness, pleasant to drink; and the other salt, that burns by its saltness; yet from each of them you eat fresh flesh and bring forth ornaments which you wear; and you see the ships cleave through it that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful. 035.013 Y: He merges Night into Day, and he merges Day into Night, and he has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law): each one runs its course for a term appointed. Such is God your Lord: to Him belongs all Dominion. And those whom ye invoke besides Him have not the least power. P: He maketh the night to pass into the day and He maketh the day to pass into the night. He hath subdued the sun and moon to service. Each runneth unto an appointed term. Such is God, your Lord; His is the Sovereignty; and those unto whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white spot on a date-stone. S: He causes the night to enter in upon the day, and He causes the day to enter in upon the night, and He has made subservient (to you) the sun and the moon; each one follows its course to an appointed time; this is God, your Lord, His is the kingdom; and those whom you call upon besides Him do not control a straw. 035.014 Y: If ye invoke them, they will not listen to your call, and if they were to listen, they cannot answer your (prayer). On the Day of Judgment they will reject your "Partnership". and none, (O man!) can tell thee (the Truth) like the One Who is acquainted with all things. P: If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they heard they could not grant it you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with you. None can inform you like Him Who is Aware. S: If you call on them they shall not hear your call, and even if they could hear they shall not answer you; and on the resurrection day they will deny your associating them (with God); and none can inform you like the One Who is Aware. 035.015 Y: O ye men! It is ye that have need of God: but God is the One Free of all wants, worthy of all praise. P: O mankind! Ye are the poor in your relation to God. And God! He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. S: O men! you are they who stand in need of God, and God is He Who is the Self-sufficient, the Praised One. 035.016 Y: If He so pleased, He could blot you out and bring in a New Creation. P: If He will, He can be rid of you and bring (instead of you) some new creation.""Faith) from a position (so) far off,- P: And say: We (now) believe therein. But how can they reach (faith) from afar off, S: And they shall say: We believe in it. And how shall the attaining (of faith) be possible to them from a distant place? 034.053 Y: Seeing that they did reject Faith (entirely) before, and that they (continually) cast (slanders) on the unseen from a position far off?

P: That is not a hard thing for God. S: And this is not hard to God. 035.018 Y: Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another's burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and the destination (of all) is to God. P: And no burdened soul can bear another's burden, and if one heavy laden crieth for (help with) his load, naught of it will be lifted even though he (unto whom he crieth) be of kin. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in secret, and have established worship. He who groweth (in goodness), groweth only for himself, (he cannot by his merit redeem others). Unto God is the journeying. S: And a burdened soul cannot bear the burden of another and if one weighed down by burden should cry for (another to carry) its burden, not aught of it shall be carried, even though he be near of kin. You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer; and whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the good of) his own soul; and to God is the eventual coming. 035.019 Y: The blind and the seeing are not alike; P: The blind man is not equal with the seer; S: And the blind and the seeing are not alike 035.020 Y: Nor are the depths of Darkness and the Light; P: Nor is darkness (tantamount to) light; S: Nor the darkness and the light, 035.021 Y: Nor are the (chilly) shade and the (genial) heat of the sun: P: Nor is the shadow equal with the sun's full heat; S: Nor the shade and the heat, 035.022 Y: Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. God can make any that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are (buried) in graves. P: Nor are the living equal with the dead. Lo! God maketh whom He will to hear. Thou canst not reach those who are in the graves. S: Neither are the living and the dead alike. Surely God makes whom He pleases hear, and you cannot make those hear who are in the graves. 035.023 Y: Thou art no other than a warner. P: Thou art but a warner. S: You are naught but a warner. 035.024 Y: Verily We have sent thee in truth, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner: and there never was a people, without a warner having lived among them (in the past). P: Lo! We have sent thee with the Truth, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner; and there is not a nation but a warner hath passed among them. S: Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner; and there is not a people but a warner has gone among them. 035.025 Y: And if they reject thee, so did their predecessors, to whom came their messengers with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment. P: And if they deny thee, those before them also denied. Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty), and with the Psalms and the Scripture giving light. S: And if they call you a liar, so did those before them indeed call (their messengers) liars; their messengers had come to them with clear arguments, and with scriptures, and with the illuminating book. 035.026 Y: In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith: and how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)! P: Then seized I those who disbelieved, and how intense was My abhorrence! S: Then did I punish those who disbelieved, so how was the manifestation of My disapproval? 035.027 Y: Seest thou not that God sends down rain from the sky? With it We then bring out produce of various colours. And in the mountains are tracts white and red, of various shades of colour, and black intense in hue. P: Hast thou not seen that God causeth water to fall from the sky, and We produce therewith fruit of divers hues; and among the hills are streaks white and red, of divers hues, and (others) raven-black; S: Do you not see that God sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth therewith fruits of various colors; and in the mountains are streaks, white and red, of various hues and (others) intensely black? 035.028 Y: And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle, are they of various colours. Those truly fear God, among His Servants, who have knowledge: for God is Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving. P: And of men and beasts and cattle, in like manner, divers hues? The erudite among His bondmen fear God alone. Lo! God is Mighty, Forgiving. S: And of men and beasts and cattle are various species of it likewise; those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear God; surely God is Mighty, Forgiving. 035.029 Y: Those who rehearse the Book of God, establish regular Prayer, and spend (in Charity) out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a commerce that will never fail: P: Lo! those who read the Scripture of God, and establish worship, and spend of that which We have bestowed on them secretly and openly, they look forward to imperishable gain, S: Surely they who recite the Book of God and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly, hope for a gain which will not perish. 035.030 Y: For He will pay them their meed, nay, He will give them (even) more out of His Bounty: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (service). P: That He will pay them their wages and increase them of His grace. Lo! He is Forgiving, Responsive. S: That He may pay them back fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace: surely He is Forgiving, Multiplier of rewards. 035.031 Y: That which We have revealed to thee of the Book is the Truth,- confirming what was (revealed) before it: for God is assuredly- with respect to His Servants - well acquainted and Fully Observant. P: As for that which We inspire in thee of the Scripture, it is the Truth confirming that which was (revealed) before it. Lo! God is indeed Observer, Seer of His slaves. S: And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, that is the truth verifying that which is before it; most surely with respect to His servants God is Aware, Seeing. 035.032 Y: Then We have given the Book for inheritance to such of Our Servants as We have chosen: but there are among them some who wrong their own souls; some who follow a middle course; and some who are, by God's leave, foremost in good deeds that is the highest Grace. P: Then We gave the Scripture as inheritance unto those whom We elected of Our bondmen. But of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who are lukewarm, and of them are some who outstrip (others) through good deeds, by God's leave. That is the great favour! S: Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants; but of them is he who makes his soul to suffer a loss, and of them is he who takes a middle course, and of them is he who is foremost in deeds of goodness by God's permission; this is the great excellence. 035.033 Y: Gardens of Eternity will they enter: therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk. P: Gardens of Eden! They enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl and their raiment therein is silk.

P: Who, of His grace, hath installed us in the mansion of eternity, where toil toucheth us not nor can weariness affect us. S: Who has made us alight in a house abiding forever out of His grace; toil shall not touch us therein, nor shall fatigue therein afflict us. 035.036 Y: But those who reject (God) - for them will be the Fire of Hell: No term shall be determined for them, so they should die, nor shall its Penalty be lightened for them. Thus do We reward every ungrateful one! P: But as for those who disbelieve, for them is fire of hell; it taketh not complete effect upon them so that they can die, nor is its torment lightened for them. Thus We punish every ingrate. S: And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is the fire of hell; it shall not be finished with them entirely so that they should die, nor shall the chastisement thereof be lightened to them: even thus do We retribute every ungrateful one. 035.037 Y: Therein will they cry aloud (for assistance): "Our Lord! Bring us out: we shall work righteousness, not the (deeds) we used to do!" - "Did We not give you long enough life so that he that would should receive admonition? and (moreover) the warner came to you. So taste ye (the fruits of your deeds): for the wrong-doers there is no helper." P: And they cry for help there, (saying): Our Lord! Release us; we will do right, not (the wrong) that we used to do. Did not We grant you a life long enough for him who reflected to reflect therein? And the warner came unto you. Now taste (the flavour of your deeds), for evil-doers have no helper. S: And they shall cry therein for succour: O our Lord! take us out, we will do good deeds other than those which we used to do. Did We not preserve you alive long enough, so that he who would be mindful in it should mind? And there came to you the warner; therefore taste; because for the unjust, there is no helper. 035.038 Y: Verily God knows (all) the hidden things of the heavens and the earth: verily He has full knowledge of all that is in (men's) hearts.

S: Surely God is the Knower of what is unseen in the heavens and the earth; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the hearts. 035.039 Y: He it is that has made you inheritors in the earth: if, then, any do reject (God), their rejection (works) against themselves: their rejection but adds to the odium for the Unbelievers in the sight of their Lord: their rejection but adds to (their own) undoing. P: He it is Who hath made you regents in the earth; so he who disbelieveth, his disbelief be on his own head. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers, in their Lord's sight, naught save abhorrence. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers naught save loss. S: He it is Who made you rulers""S: If He please, He will take you off and bring a new generation. 035.017 Y: Nor is that (at all) difficult for God. P: That is not a hard thing for God. S: And this is not hard to God. 035.018 Y: Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another's burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and the destination (of all) is to God. P: And no burdened soul can bear another's burden, and if one heavy laden crieth for (help with) his load, naught of it will be lifted even though he (unto whom he crieth) be of kin. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in secret, and have established worship. He who groweth (in goodness), groweth only for himself, (he cannot by his merit redeem others). Unto God is the journeying. S: And a burdened soul cannot bear the burden of another and if one weighed down by burden should cry for (another to carry) its burden, not aught of it shall be carried, even though he be near of kin. You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer; and whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the good of) his own soul; and to God is the eventual coming. 035.019 Y: The blind and the seeing are not alike; P: The blind man is not equal with the seer; S: And the blind and the seeing are not alike 035.020 Y: Nor are the depths of Darkness and the Light; P: Nor is darkness (tantamount to) light; S: Nor the darkness and the light, 035.021 Y: Nor are the (chilly) shade and the (genial) heat of the sun: P: Nor is the shadow equal with the sun's full heat; S: Nor the shade and the heat, 035.022 Y: Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. God can make any that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are (buried) in graves. P: Nor are the living equal with the dead. Lo! God maketh whom He will to hear. Thou canst not reach those who are in the graves. S: Neither are the living and the dead alike. Surely God makes whom He pleases hear, and you cannot make those hear who are in the graves. 035.023 Y: Thou art no other than a warner. P: Thou art but a warner. S: You are naught but a warner. 035.024 Y: Verily We have sent thee in truth, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner: and there never was a people, without a warner having lived among them (in the past). P: Lo! We have sent thee with the Truth, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner; and there is not a nation but a warner hath passed among them. S: Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner; and there is not a people but a warner has gone among them. 035.025 Y: And if they reject thee, so did their predecessors, to whom came their messengers with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment. P: And if they deny thee, those before them also denied. Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty), and with the Psalms and the Scripture giving light. S: And if they call you a liar, so did those before them indeed call (their messengers) liars; their messengers had come to them with clear arguments, and with scriptures, and with the illuminating book. 035.026 Y: In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith: and how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)! P: Then seized I those who disbelieved, and how intense was My abhorrence! S: Then did I punish those who disbelieved, so how was the manifestation of My disapproval? 035.027 Y: Seest thou not that God sends down rain from the sky? With it We then bring out produce of various colours. And in the mountains are tracts white and red, of various shades of colour, and black intense in hue. P: Hast thou not seen that God causeth water to fall from the sky, and We produce therewith fruit of divers hues; and among the hills are streaks white and red, of divers hues, and (others) raven-black; S: Do you not see that God sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth therewith fruits of various colors; and in the mountains are streaks, white and red, of various hues and (others) intensely black? 035.028 Y: And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle, are they of various colours. Those truly fear God, among His Servants, who have knowledge: for God is Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving. P: And of men and beasts and cattle, in like manner, divers hues? The erudite among His bondmen fear God alone. Lo! God is Mighty, Forgiving.

He would not leave on the back of the (earth) a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: when their Term expires, verily God has in His sight all His Servants. P: If God took mankind to task by that which they deserve, He would not leave a living creature on the surface of the earth; but He reprieveth them unto an appointed term, and when their term cometh - then verily (they will know that) God is ever Seer of His slaves. S: And were God to punish men for what they earn, He would not leave on the back of it any creature, but He respites them till an appointed term; so when their doom shall come, then surely God is Seeing with respect to His servants. - Chapter 36: YA-SEEN (YA-SEEN)Total Verses: 83 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 036.001 Y: Ya Sin.

S: Follow him who does not ask you for reward, and they are the followers of the right course; 036.022 Y: "It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me, and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back." P: For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye will be brought back? S: And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who brought me into existence? And to Him you shall be brought back; 036.023 Y: "Shall I take (other) gods besides Him? If (God) Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me, of no use whatever will be their intercession for me, nor can they deliver me." P: Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save? S: What! shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession, if the Beneficent God should desire to afflict me with a harm, shall not avail me aught, nor shall they be able to deliver me? 036.024 Y: "I would indeed, if I were to do so, be in manifest Error." P: Then truly I should be in error manifest. S: In that case I shall most surely be in clear error: 036.025 Y: "For me, I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen, then, to me!" P: Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me! S: Surely I believe in your Lord, therefore hear me. 036.026 Y: It was said: "Enter thou the Garden." He said: "Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!" P: It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew, S: It was said: Enter the garden. He said: O would that my people had known, 036.027 Y: "For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour!" P: With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones! S: Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored ones! 036.028 Y: And We sent not down against his People, after him, any hosts from heaven, nor was it needful for Us so to do. P: We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do We ever send. S: And We did not send down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven, nor do We ever send down. 036.029 Y: It was no more than a single mighty Blast, and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent. P: It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. S: It was naught but a single cry, and lo! they were still. 036.030 Y: Ah! Alas for (My) Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him! P: Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him! S: Alas for the servants! there comes not to them a messenger but they mock at him. 036.031 Y: See they not how many generations before them we destroyed? Not to them will they return: P: Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them; S: Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, because they do not turn to them? 036.032 Y: But each one of them all - will be brought before Us (for judgment). P: But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. S: And all of them shall surely be brought before Us. 036.033 Y: A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat. P: A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it grain so that they eat thereof; S: And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and bring forth from it grain so they eat of it. 036.034 Y: And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines, and We cause springs to gush forth therein: P: And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, S: And We make therein gardens of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth in it, 036.035 Y: That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks? P: That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks? S: That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands did not make it; will they not then be grateful? 036.036 Y: Glory to God, Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces, as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge. P: Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not! S: Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of their kind and of what they do not know. 036.037 Y: And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day, and behold they are plunged in darkness; P: A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in darkness. S: And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! they are in the dark; 036.038 Y: And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the decree of (Him), the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing. P: And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. S: And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing. 036.039 Y: And the Moon,- We have measured for her mansions (to traverse) till she returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk. P: And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf. S: And (as for) the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an old dry palm branch. 036.040 Y: It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law). P: It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit. S: Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day; and all float on in a sphere. 036.041 Y: And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark; P: And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship, S: And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship. 036.042 Y: And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride. P: And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. S: And We have created for them the like of it, what they will ride on. 036.043 Y: If it were Our Will, We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry), nor could they be delivered, P: And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can they be saved; S: And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no succorer for them, nor shall they be rescued, 036.044 Y: Except by way of Mercy from Us, and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time. P: Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. S: But (by) mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time. 036.045 Y: When they are told, "Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you, in order that ye may receive Mercy," (they turn back). P: When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). S: And when it is said to them: Guard against what is before you and what is behind you, that mercy may be had on you. 036.046 Y: Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom. P: Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn away from it! S: And there comes not to them a communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it. 036.047 Y: And when they are told, "Spend ye of (the bounties) with which God has provided you," the Unbelievers say to those who believe: "Shall we then feed those whom, if God had so willed, He would have fed, (Himself)?- Ye are in nothing but manifest error." P: And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith God hath provided you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom God, if He willed, would feed? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. S: And when it is said to them: Spend out of what God has given you, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Shall we feed him whom, if God please, He could feed? You are in naught but clear error. 036.048 Y: Further, they say, "When will this promise (come to pass), if what ye say is true?" P: And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful? S: And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful? 036.049 Y: They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves! P: They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. S: They wait not for aught but a single cry which will overtake them while they yet contend with one another. 036.050 Y: No (chance) will they then have, by will, to dispose (of their affairs), nor to return to their own people! P: Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk. S: So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families. 036.051 Y: The trumpet shall be sounded, when behold! from the sepulchres (men) will rush forth to their Lord! P: And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord, S: And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! from their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord. 036.052 Y: They will say: "Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose?" (A voice will say:) "This is what (God) Most Gracious had promised. And true was the word of the messengers!" P: Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep? This is that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth. S: They shall say: O woe to us! who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is what the Beneficent God promised and the messengers told the truth. 036.053 Y: It will be no more than a single Blast, when lo! they will all be brought up before Us! P: It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us! S: There would be naught but a single cry, when lo! they shall all be brought before Us. 036.054 Y: Then, on that Day, not a soul will be wronged in the least, and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds. P: This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye used to do. S: So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you used to do.Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do; those who merit paradise this day are happily employed. Surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in an occupation quite happy. They and their associates will be in groves of (cool) shade, reclining on Thrones (of dignity); they and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining. They shall have fruits therein, and they shall have whatever they desire. "Peace!" - a word (of salutation) from a Lord Most Merciful! "And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day!" "Did I not enjoin on you, O ye Children of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed?" "And that ye should worship Me, (for that) this was the Straight Way?" "But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not, then, understand?" "This is the Hell of which ye were (repeatedly) warned!" "Embrace ye the (fire) this Day, for that ye (persistently) rejected (Truth)." That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak to us, and their feet bear witness, to all that they did. If it had been our Will, We could surely have blotted out their eyes; then should they have run about groping for the Path, but how could they have seen? And if it had been Our Will, We could have transformed them (to remain) in their places; then should they have been unable to move about, nor could they have returned (after error). If We grant long life to any, We cause him to be reversed in nature: Will they not then understand? We have not instructed the (Prophet) in Poetry, nor is it meet for him: this is no less than a Message and a Qur'an making things clear: That it may give admonition to any (who are) alive, and that the charge may be proved against those who reject (Truth). See they not that it is We Who have created for them - among the things which Our hands have fashioned - cattle, which are under their dominion? And that We have subjected them to their (use)? of them some do carry them and some they eat: And they have (other) profits from them (besides), and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful? Yet they take (for worship) gods other than God, (hoping) that they might be helped! They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up (before Our Judgment-seat) as a troop (to be condemned). Let not their speech, then, grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose. Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? yet behold! he (stands forth) as an open adversary! And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own (origin and) Creation: He says, "Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)?" Say, "He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He is Well-versed in every kind of creation!" "The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold! ye kindle therewith (your own fires)!" "Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof?" - Yea, indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme, of skill and knowledge (infinite)! Verily, when He intends a thing, His Command is, "be", and it is! So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him will ye be all brought back.th him a piercing flame. S: Except him who snatches off but once, then there follows him a brightly shining flame. 037.011 Y: Just ask their opinion: are they the more difficult to create, or the (other) beings We have created? Them have We created out of a sticky clay! P: Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those (others) whom we have created? Lo! We created them of plastic clay. S: Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those (others) whom We have created. Surely We created them of firm clay. 037.012 Y: Truly dost thou marvel, while they ridicule, P: Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock S: Nay! you wonder while they mock, 037.013 Y: And, when they are admonished, pay no heed,- P: And heed not when they are reminded, S: And when they are reminded, they mind not, 037.014 Y: And, when they see a Sign, turn it to mockery, P: And seek to scoff when they behold a portent. S: And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff, 037.015 Y: And say, "This is nothing but evident sorcery!" P: And they say: Lo! this is mere magic; S: And they say: This is nothing but clear magic: 037.016 Y: "What! when we die, and become dust and bones, shall we (then) be raised up (again)?" P: When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised (again)? S: What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then certainly be raised, 037.017 Y: "And also our fathers of old?" P: And our forefathers? S: Or our fathers of yore? 037.018 Y: Say thou: "Yea, and ye shall then be humiliated (on account of your evil)." P: Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. S: Say: Aye! and you shall be abject. 037.019 Y: Then it will be a single (compelling) cry; and behold, they will begin to see! P: There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold, S: So it shall only be a single cry, when lo! they shall see. 037.020 Y: They will say, "Ah! Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!" P: And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment. S: And they shall say: O woe to us! this is the day of requital. 037.021 Y: (A voice will say,) "This is the Day of Sorting Out, whose truth ye (once) denied!" P: This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. S: This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie. 037.022 Y: "Bring ye up", it shall be said, "The wrong-doers and their wives, and the things they worshipped-" P: (And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together with their wives and what they used to worship S: Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to worship 037.023 Y: "Besides God, and lead them to the Way to the (Fierce) Fire!" P: Instead of God, and lead them to the path to hell; S: Besides God, then lead them to the way to hell. 037.024 Y: "But stop them, for they must be asked:" P: And stop them, for they must be questioned. S: And stop them, for they shall be questioned: 037.025 Y: "'What is the matter with you that ye help not each other?'" P: What aileth you that ye help not one another? S: What is the matter with you that you do not help each other? 037.026 Y: Nay, but that day they shall submit (to Judgment); P: Nay, but this day they make full submission. S: Nay! on that day they shall be submissive. 037.027 Y: And they will turn to one another, and question one another. P: And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. S: And some of them shall advance towards others, questioning each other. 037.028 Y: They will say: "It was ye who used to come to us from the right hand (of power and authority)!" P: They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke the truth). S: They shall say: Surely you used to come to us from the right side. 037.029 Y: They will reply: "Nay, ye yourselves had no Faith!" P: They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers. S: They shall say: Nay, you (yourselves) were not believers; 037.030 Y: "Nor had we any authority over you. Nay, it was ye who were a people in obstinate rebellion!" P: We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. S: And we had no authority over you, but you were an inordinate people; 037.031 Y: "So now has been proved true, against us, the word of our Lord that we shall indeed (have to) taste (the punishment of our sins)." P: Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are about to taste (the doom). S: So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us: (now) we shall surely taste; 037.032 Y: "We led you astray: for truly we were ourselves astray." P: Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. S: So we led you astray, for we ourselves were erring. 037.033 Y: Truly, that Day, they will (all) share in the Penalty. P: Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. S: So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement one with another. 037.034 Y: Verily that is how We shall deal with Sinners. P: Lo! thus deal We with the guilty. S: Surely thus do We deal with the guilty. 037.035 Y: For they, when they were told that there is no god except God, would puff themselves up with Pride, P: For when it was said unto them, There is no God save God, they were scornful S: Surely they used to behave proudly when it was said to them: There is no god but God; 037.036 Y: And say: "What! shall we give up our gods for the sake of a Poet possessed?" P: And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet? S: And to say: What! shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet? 037.037 Y: Nay! he has come with the (very) Truth, and he confirms (the Message of) the messengers (before him). P: Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). S: Nay: he has come with the truth and verified the messengers. 037.038 Y: Ye shall indeed taste of the Grievous Penalty;- P: Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - S: Most surely you will taste the painful punishment. 037.039 Y: But it will be no more than the retribution of (the Evil) that ye have wrought;- P: Ye are requited naught save what ye did - S: And you shall not be rewarded except (for) what you did. 037.040 Y: But the sincere (and devoted) Servants of God,- P: Save single-minded slaves of God; S: Save the servants of God, the purified ones. 037.041 Y: For them is a Sustenance determined, P: For them there is a known provision, S: For them is a known sustenance, 037.042 Y: Fruits (Delights); and they (shall enjoy) honour and dignity, P: Fruits.

S: Who said: What! are you indeed of those who accept (the truth)? 037.053 Y: "'When we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed receive rewards and punishments?'" P: Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we (then) verily be brought to book? S: What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be certainly brought to judgment? 037.054 Y: (A voice) said: "Would ye like to look down?" P: He saith: Will ye look? S: He shall say: Will you look on? 037.055 Y: He looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire. P: Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell.

S: Or our fathers of yore? 037.018 Y: Say thou: "Yea, and ye shall then be humiliated (on account of your evil)." P: Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. S: Say: Aye! and you shall be abject. 037.019 Y: Then it will be a single (compelling) cry; and behold, they will begin to see!

P: This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. S: This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie. 037.022 Y: "Bring ye up", it shall be said, "The wrong-doers and their wives, and the things they worshipped-" P: (And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together with their wives and what they used to worship S: Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to worship 037.023 Y: "Besides God, and lead them to the Way to the (Fierce) Fire!"

P: He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised; S: He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised. 037.145 Y: But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness, P: Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick; S: Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he was sick. 037.146 Y: And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind. P: And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him; S: And We caused to grow up for him a gourd plant. 037.147 Y: And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more. P: And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more S: And We sent him to a hundred thousand, rather they exceeded. 037.148 Y: And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while. P: And they believed, therefore We gave them comfort for a while. S: And they believed, so We gave them provision till a time. 037.149 Y: Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has (only) daughters, and they have sons?- P: Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have sons? S: Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they have sons. 037.150 Y: Or that We created the angels female, and they are witnesses (thereto)? P: Or created We the angels females while they were present? S: Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses? 037.151 Y: Is it not that they say, from their own invention, P: Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say: S: Now surely it is of their own lie that they say: 037.152 Y: "God has begotten children"? but they are liars! P: God hath begotten. God! verily they tell a lie. S: God has begotten; and most surely they are liars. 037.153 Y: Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons? P: (And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons. S: Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons? 037.154 Y: What is the matter with you? How judge ye? P: What aileth you? How judge ye? S: What is the matter with you, how is it that you judge? 037.155 Y: Will ye not then receive admonition? P: Will ye not then reflect? S: Will you not then mind? 037.156 Y: Or have ye an authority manifest? P: Or have ye a clear warrant? S: Or have you a clear authority? 037.157 Y: Then bring ye your Book (of authority) if ye be truthful! P: Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful. S: Then bring your book, if you are truthful. 037.158 Y: And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the jinns: but the jinns know (quite well) that they have indeed to appear (before his Judgment-Seat)! P: And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before (Him). S: And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn; and certainly the jinn do know that they shall surely be brought up; 037.159 Y: Glory to God! (He is free) from the things they ascribe (to Him)! P: Glorified be God from that which they attribute (unto Him), S: Glory be to God (for freedom) from what they describe; 037.160 Y: Not (so do) the Servants of God, sincere and devoted. P: Save single-minded slaves of God. S: But not so the servants of God, the purified ones. 037.161 Y: For, verily, neither ye nor those ye worship- P: Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship, S: So surely you and what you worship, 037.162 Y: Can lead (any) into temptation concerning God, P: Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him. S: Not against Him can you cause (any) to fall into trial, 037.163 Y: Except such as are (themselves) going to the blazing Fire! P: Save him who is to burn in hell.

S: And there is none of us but has an assigned place, 037.165 Y: "And we are verily ranged in ranks (for service);" P: Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks, S: And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in ranks, 037.166 Y: "And we are verily those who declare (God's) glory!" P: Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise S: And we are most surely they who declare the glory (of God). 037.167 Y: And there were those who said, P: And indeed they used to say: S: And surely they used to say: 037.168 Y: "If only we had had before us a Message from those of old," P: If we had but a reminder from the men of old S: Had we a reminder from those of yore, 037.169 Y: "We should certainly have been Servants of God, sincere (and devoted)!" P: We would be single-minded slaves of God. S: We would certainly have been the servants of God the purified ones. 037.170 Y: But (now that the Qur'an has come), they reject it: But soon will they know! P: Yet (now that it is come) they disbelieve therein; but they will come to know. S: But (now) they disbelieve in it, so they will come to know. 037.171 Y: Already has Our Word been passed before (this) to our Servants sent (by Us), P: And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent (to warn) S: And certainly Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the messengers: 037.172 Y: That they would certainly be assisted, P: That they verily would be helped, S: Most surely they shall be the assisted ones 037.173 Y: And that Our forces,- they surely must conquer. P: And that Our host, they verily would be the victors. S: And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones. 037.174 Y: So turn thou away from them for a little while, P: So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) awhile, S: Therefore turn away from them till a time, 037.175 Y: And watch them (how they fare), and they soon shall see (how thou farest)! P: And watch, for they will (soon) see. S: And (then) see them, so they too shall see. 037.176 Y: Do they wish (indeed) to hurry on our Punishment? P: Would they hasten on Our doom? S: What! would they then hasten on Our chastisement? 037.177 Y: But when it descends into the open space before them, evil will be the morning for those who were warned (and heeded not)! P: But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morning for those who have been warned. S: But when it shall descend in their court, evil shall then be the morning of the warned ones. 037.178 Y: So turn thou away from them for a little while, P: Withdraw from them awhile S: And turn away from them till a time 037.179 Y: And watch (how they fare) and they soon shall see (how thou farest)!

...they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. 037.067 Then on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water. 037.068 Then shall their return be to the Blazing Fire. 037.069 Truly they found their fathers on the wrong path; 037.070 So they too were rushed down on their footsteps! 037.071 And truly before them, many of the ancients went astray; 037.072 But We sent among them messengers to admonish them; 037.073 Then see what was the end of those who were admonished but heeded not, 037.074 Except the sincere and devoted servants of God. 037.075 In the days of old, Noah cried to Us, and We are the best to hear prayer. 037.076 And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity, 037.077 And made his progeny to endure on this earth; 037.078 And We left this blessing for him among generations to come in later times: 037.079 "Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations!" 037.080 Thus indeed do we reward those who do right. 037.081 For he was one of our believing servants. 037.082 Then the rest we overwhelmed in the Flood. 037.083 Verily among those who followed his way was Abraham. 037.084 Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart. 037.085 Behold! he said to his father and to his people, "What is that which ye worship?" 037.086 "Is it a falsehood- gods other than God- that ye desire?" 037.087 "Then what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?" 037.088 Then did he cast a glance at the stars. 037.089 And he said, "I am indeed sick at heart!" 037.090 So they turned away from him, and departed. 037.091 Then did he turn to their gods and said, "Will ye not eat of the offerings before you?" 037.092 "What is the matter with you that ye speak not intelligently?" 037.093 Then did he turn upon them, striking them with the right hand. 037.094 Then came the worshippers with hurried steps, and faced him. 037.095 He said: "Worship ye that which ye have yourselves carved?" 037.096 "But God has created you and your handwork!" 037.097 They said, "Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!" 037.098 This failing, they then sought a stratagem against him, but We made them the ones most humiliated! 037.099 He said: "I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me!" 037.100 "O my Lord! Grant me a righteous son!" 037.101 So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear. 037.102 Then, when the son reached the age of serious work with him, he said: "O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!" The son said: "O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if God so wills, one practicing patience and constancy!" 037.103 So when they had both submitted their wills to God, and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead for sacrifice, 037.104 We called out to him "O Abraham!" 037.105 "Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed do We reward those who do right. 037.106 For this was obviously a trial- 037.107 And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice: 037.108 And We left this blessing for him among generations to come in later times: 037.109 "Peace and salutation to Abraham!" 037.110 Thus indeed do We reward those who do right. 037.111 For he was one of our believing servants. 037.112 And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet, one of the righteous. 037.113 We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are some that do right, and some that obviously do wrong, to their own souls. 037.114 Again of old We bestowed Our favor on Moses and Aaron, 037.115 And We delivered them and their people from their Great Calamity; 037.116 And We helped them, so they overcame their troubles; 037.117 And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear; 037.118 And We guided them to the Straight Way. 037.119 And We left this blessing for them among generations to come in later times: 037.120 "Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron!" 037.121 Thus indeed do We reward those who do right. 037.122 For they were two of our believing servants.

S: Even thus do We reward the doers of good. 037.132 Y: For he was one of our believing Servants. P: Lo! he is one of our believing slaves.

S: And Lut was most surely of the messengers. 037.134 Y: Behold, We delivered him and his adherents, all P: When We saved him and his household, every one, S: When We delivered him and his followers, all 037.135 Y: Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind: P: Save an old woman among those who stayed behind; S: Except an old woman (who was) amongst those who tarried. 037.136 Y: Then We destroyed the rest. P: Then We destroyed the others.

P: And at night-time; have ye then no sense? S: And at night; do you not then understand? 037.139 Y: So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us). P: And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn) S: And Yunus was most surely of the messengers. 037.140 Y: When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden, P: When he fled unto the laden ship, S: When he ran away to a ship completely laden, 037.141 Y: He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned: P: And then drew lots and was of those rejected; S: So he shared (with them), but was of those who are cast off. 037.142 Y: Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame. P: And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy; S: So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself. 037.143 Y: Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified God, P: And had he not been one of those who glorify (God) S: But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us), 037.144 Y: He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.

P: And they believed, therefore We gave them comfort for a while.

P: Sad.By the renowned Qur'an, full of admonition. But the Unbelievers are steeped in self-glory and Separatism. How many generations before them did We destroy? In the end, they cried for mercy when there was no longer time for being saved! So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! And the Unbelievers say, "This is a sorcerer telling lies!" "Has he made the gods all into one God? Truly this is a wonderful thing!" And the leaders among them go away impatiently, saying, "Walk away, and remain constant to your gods! For this is truly a thing designed against you!" "We never heard the like of this among the people of these latter days: this is nothing but a made-up tale!" "What! Has the Message been sent to him of all persons among us?" But they are in doubt concerning My Message! Nay, they have not yet tasted My Punishment! Or have they the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Exalted in Power, the Grantor of Bounties without measure? Or have they the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all between? If so, let them mount up with the ropes and means to reach that end! But there will be put to flight even a host of confederates. Before them were many who rejected messengers: the people of Noah, 'Ad, and Pharaoh, the Lord of Stakes, and Thamud, and the people of Lut, and the Companions of the Wood; such were the Confederates. Not one of them but rejected the messengers, but My punishment came justly and inevitably on them. These today only wait for a single mighty Blast, which when it comes will brook no delay. They say, "Our Lord! Hasten to us our sentence even before the Day of Account!" Have patience at what they say, and remember our servant David, the man of strength: for he ever turned to God. It was We that made the hills declare, in unison with him, Our Praises, at eventide and at break of day, and the birds gathered in assemblies: all with him did turn to God. We strengthened his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech and decision. Has the Story of the Disputants reached thee? Behold, they climbed over the wall of the private chamber; when they entered the presence of David, and he was terrified of them, they said: "Fear not: we are two disputants, one of whom has wronged the other: Decide now between us with truth, and treat us not with injustice, but guide us to the even Path." "This man is my brother: He has ninety-nine ewes, and I have but one: Yet he says, 'commit her to my care,' and is moreover harsh to me in speech." David said: "He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy single ewe to be added to his flock of ewes: truly many are the partners in business who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and how few are they?" And David gathered that We had tried him: he asked forgiveness of his Lord, fell down, bowing in prostration, and turned to God in repentance. So We forgave him this lapse: he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful place of Final Return. O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth: so judge thou between men in truth and justice: Nor follow thou the lusts of thy heart, for they will mislead thee from the Path of God: for those who wander astray from the Path of God, is a Penalty Grievous, for that they forget the Day of Account. Not without purpose did We create heaven and earth and all between! That were the thought of Unbelievers! But woe to the Unbelievers because of the Fire of Hell! Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the same as those who do mischief on earth? Shall We treat those who guard against evil, the same as those who turn aside from the right? Here is a Book which We have sent down unto thee.By the renowned Qur'an, S: Suad, I swear by the Quran, full of admonition. 038.002 Y: But the Unbelievers (are steeped) in self-glory and Separatism. P: Nay, but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism. S: Nay! those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation and opposition. 038.003 Y: How many generations before them did We destroy? In the end they cried (for mercy)- when there was no longer time for being saved! P: How many a generation We destroyed before them, and they cried out when it was no longer the time for escape! S: How many did We destroy before them of the generations, then they cried while the time of escaping had passed away. 038.004 Y: So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! and the Unbelievers say, "This is a sorcerer telling lies!" P: And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them, and the disbelievers say: This is a wizard, a charlatan. S: And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves, and the disbelievers say: This is an enchanter, a liar. 038.005 Y: "Has he made the gods (all) into one God? Truly this is a wonderful thing!" P: Maketh he the gods One God? Lo! that is an astounding thing. S: What! makes he the gods a single God? A strange thing is this, to be sure! 038.006 Y: And the leader among them go away (impatiently), (saying), "Walk ye away, and remain constant to your gods! For this is truly a thing designed (against you)!" P: The chiefs among them go about, exhorting: Go and be staunch to your gods! Lo! this is a thing designed. S: And the chief persons of them break forth, saying: Go and steadily adhere to your gods; this is most surely a thing sought after. 038.007 Y: "We never heard (the like) of this among the people of these latter days: this is nothing but a made-up tale!" P: We have not heard of this in later religion. This is naught but an invention. S: We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but a forgery: 038.008 Y: "What! has the Message been sent to him - (Of all persons) among us?" but they are in doubt concerning My (Own) Message! Nay, they have not yet tasted My Punishment! P: Hath the reminder been unto him (alone) among us? Nay, but they are in doubt concerning My reminder; nay but they have not yet tasted My doom. S: Has the reminder been revealed to him from among us? Nay! they are in doubt as to My reminder. Nay! they have not yet tasted My chastisement! 038.009 Y: Or have they the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord,- the Exalted in Power, the Grantor of Bounties without measure? P: Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower? S: Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the great Giver? 038.010 Y: Or have they the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all between? If so, let them mount up with the ropes and means (to reach that end)! P: Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them theirs? Then let them ascend by ropes! S: Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Then let them ascend by any means. 038.011 Y: But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates. P: A defeated host are (all) the factions that are there. S: A host of deserters of the allies shall be here put to flight. 038.012 Y: Before them (were many who) rejected messengers,- the people of Noah, and 'Ad, and Pharaoh, the Lord of Stakes, P: The folk of Noah before them denied (their messenger) and (so did the tribe of) A'ad, and Pharaoh firmly planted, S: The people of Nuh and Ad, and Firon, the lord of spikes, rejected (messengers) before them. 038.013 Y: And Thamud, and the people of Lut, and the Companions of the Wood; - such were the Confederates. P: And (the tribe of) Thamud, and the folk of Lot, and the dwellers in the wood: these were the factions. S: And Samood and the people of Lut and the dwellers of the thicket; these were the parties. 038.014 Y: Not one (of them) but rejected the messengers, but My punishment came justly and inevitably (on them). P: Not one of them but did deny the messengers, therefore My doom was justified, S: There was none of them but called the messengers liars, so just was My retribution. 038.015 Y: These (today) only wait for a single mighty Blast, which (when it comes) will brook no delay. P: These wait for but one Shout, there will be no second thereto. S: Nor do these await aught but a single cry, there being no delay in it. 038.016 Y: They say: "Our Lord! hasten to us our sentence (even) before the Day of Account!" P: They say: Our Lord! Hasten on for us our fate before the Day of Reckoning. S: And they say: O our Lord! hasten on to us our portion before the day of reckoning. 038.017 Y: Have patience at what they say, and remember our servant David, the man of strength: for he ever turned (to God). P: Bear with what they say, and remember Our bondman David, lord of might, Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (toward God). S: Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant Dawood, the possessor of power; surely he was frequent in returning (to God). 038.018 Y: It was We that made the hills declare, in unison with him, Our Praises, at eventide and at break of day, P: Lo! We subdued the hills to hymn the praises (of their Lord) with him at nightfall and sunrise, S: Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory (of God) in unison with him at the evening and the sunrise, 038.019 Y: And the birds gathered (in assemblies): all with him did turn (to God). P: And the birds assembled; all were turning unto Him.

P: We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech. S: And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment. 038.021 Y: Has the Story of the Disputants reached thee? Behold, they climbed over the wall of the private chamber; P: And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee? How they climbed the wall into the royal chamber; S: And has there come to you the story of the litigants, when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascending over the walls? 038.022 Y: When they entered the presence of David, and he was terrified of them, they said: "Fear not: we are two disputants, one of whom has wronged the other: Decide now between us with truth, and treat us not with injustice, but guide us to the even Path" P: How they burst in upon David, and he was afraid of them. They said: Be not afraid! (We are) two litigants, one of whom hath wronged the other, therefore judge aright between us; be not unjust; and show us the fair way. S: When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened at them, they said: Fear not; two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right way. 038.023 Y: "This man is my brother: He has nine and ninety ewes, and I have (but) one: Yet he says, 'commit her to my care,' and is (moreover) harsh to me in speech." P: Lo! this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes while I had one ewe; and he said: Entrust it to me, and he conquered me in speech. S: Surely this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe; but he said: Make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in discourse. 038.024 Y: (David) said: "He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy (single) ewe to be added to his (flock of) ewes: truly many are the partners (in business) who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and how few are they?" and David gathered that We had tried him: he asked forgiveness of his Lord, fell down, bowing (in prostration), and turned (to God in repentance). P: (David) said: He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe in addition to his ewes, and lo! many partners oppress one another, save such as believe and do good works, and they are few. And David guessed that We had tried him, and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented. S: He said: Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own ewes; and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another, save those who believe and do good, and very few are they; and Dawood was sure that We had tried him, so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned time after time (to Him). 038.025 Y: So We forgave him this (lapse): he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful place of (Final) Return. P: So We forgave him that; and lo! he had access to Our presence and a happy journey's end. S: Therefore We rectified for him this, and most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort. 038.026 Y: O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth: so judge thou between men in truth (and justice): Nor follow thou the lusts (of thy heart), for they will mislead thee from the Path of God: for those who wander astray from the Path of God, is a Penalty Grievous, for that they forget the Day of Account. P: (And it was said unto him): O David! Lo! We have set thee as a viceroy in the earth; therefore judge aright between mankind, and follow not desire that it beguile thee from the way of God. Lo! those who wander from the way of God have an awful doom, forasmuch as they forgot the Day of Reckoning. S: O Dawood! surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so judge between men with justice and do not follow desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of God; (as for) those who go astray from the path of God, they shall surely have a severe punishment because they forgot the day of reckoning. 038.027 Y: Not without purpose did We create heaven and earth and all between! that were the thought of Unbelievers! but woe to the Unbelievers because of the Fire (of Hell)! P: And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in vain. That is the opinion of those who disbelieve. And woe unto those who disbelieve, from the Fire! S: And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain; that is the opinion of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account of the fire. 038.028 Y: Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the same as those who do mischief on earth? Shall We treat those who guard against evil, the same as those who turn aside from the right? P: Shall We treat those who believe and do good works as those who spread corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the pious as the wicked? S: Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers in the earth? Or shall We make those who guard (against evil) like the wicked? 038.029 Y: (Here is) a Book which We have sent down unto thee", full of blessings, that they may meditate on its Signs, and that men of understanding may receive admonition. This is a Scripture that We have revealed unto thee, full of blessing, that they may ponder its revelations, and that men of understanding may reflect. It is a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over its verses, and that those endowed with understanding may be mindful.

To David We gave Solomon (for a son),- How excellent in Our service! Ever did he turn (to Us)! And We bestowed on David, Solomon. How excellent a slave! Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (toward God). And We gave to Dawood Sulaiman, most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent in returning (to God).

Behold, there were brought before him, at eventide coursers of the highest breeding, and swift of foot; When there were shown to him at eventide lightfooted coursers When there were brought to him in the evening (horses) still when standing, swift when running. And he said, "Truly do I love the love of good, with a view to the glory of my Lord,"- until (the sun) was hidden in the veil (of night): And he said: Lo! I have preferred the good things (of the world) to the remembrance of my Lord; till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain. Then he said: Surely I preferred the good things to the remembrance of my Lord until the sun set and time for Asr prayer was over, (he said): "Bring them back to me." then began he to pass his hand over (their) legs and their necks. (Then he said): Bring them back to me, and fell to slashing (with his sword their) legs and necks. Bring them back to me; so he began to slash (their) legs and necks.

And We did try Solomon: We placed on his throne a body (without life); but he did turn (to Us in true devotion): And verily We tried Solomon, and set upon his throne a (mere) body. Then did he repent. And certainly We tried Sulaiman, and We put on his throne a (mere) body, so he turned (to God). He said, "O my Lord! Forgive me, and grant me a kingdom which, (it may be), suits not another after me: for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties (without measure)." He said: My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me sovereignty such as shall not belong to any after me. Lo! Thou art the Bestower. He said: My Lord! do Thou forgive me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for (being inherited by) anyone after me; Then We subjected the wind to his power, to flow gently to his order, Whithersoever he willed,- So We made the wind subservient unto him, setting fair by his command whithersoever he intended. Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever he desired, As also the evil ones, (including) every kind of builder and diver,- And the unruly, every builder and diver (made We subservient), And the shaitans, every builder and diver, As also others bound together in fetters. And others linked together in chains, And others fettered in chains. "Such are Our Bounties: whether thou bestow them (on others) or withhold them, no account will be asked." (Saying): This is Our gift, so bestow thou, or withhold, without reckoning. This is Our free gift, therefore give freely or withhold, without reckoning. And he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful Place of (Final) Return. And lo! he hath favour with Us, and a happy journey's end. And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort.

Commemorate Our Servant Job. Behold he cried to his Lord: "The Evil One has afflicted me with distress and suffering!" And make mention (O Muhammad) of Our bondman Job, when he cried unto his Lord (saying): Lo! the devil doth afflict me with distress and torment. And remember Our servant Ayyub, when he called upon his Lord: The Shaitan has afflicted me with toil and torment. (The command was given:) "Strike with thy foot: here is (water) wherein to wash, cool and refreshing, and (water) to drink." (And it was said unto him): Strike the ground with thy foot. This (spring) is a cool bath and a refreshing drink. Urge with your foot; here is a cool washing-place and a drink. And We gave him (back) his people, and doubled their number,- as a Grace from Ourselves, and a thing for commemoration, for all who have Understanding. And We bestowed on him (again) his household and therewith the like thereof, a mercy from Us, and a memorial for men of understanding. And We gave him his family and the like of them with them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to those possessed of understanding. "And take in thy hand a little grass, and strike therewith: and break not (thy oath)." Truly We found him full of patience and constancy. How excellent in Our service! ever did he turn (to Us)! And (it was said unto him): Take in thine hand a branch and smite therewith, and break not thine oath. Lo! We found him steadfast, how excellent a slave! Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (to his Lord). And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with it and do not break your oath; surely We found him patient; most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent in returning (to God).

And commemorate Our Servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, possessors of Power and Vision. And make mention of Our bondmen, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of parts and vision. And remember Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub, men of power and insight. Verily We did choose them for a special (purpose)- proclaiming the Message of the Hereafter. Lo! We purified them with a pure thought, remembrance of the Home (of the Hereafter). Surely We purified them by a pure quality, the keeping in mind of the (final) abode. They were, in Our sight, truly, of the company of the Elect and the Good. Lo! in Our sight they are verily of the elect, the excellent. And most surely they were with Us, of the elect, the best. And commemorate Isma'il, Elisha, and Zul-Kifl: Each of them was of the Company of the Good. And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. All are of the chosen. And remember Ismail and Al-Yasha and Zulkifl; and they were all of the best.

This is a Message (of admonition): and verily, for the righteous, is a beautiful Place of (Final) Return,- This is a reminder. And lo! for those who ward off (evil) is a happy journey's end, This is a reminder; and most surely there is an excellent resort for those who guard (against evil), Gardens of Eternity, whose doors will (ever) be open to them; Gardens of Eden, whereof the gates are opened for them, The gardens of perpetuity, the doors are opened for them. Therein will they recline (at ease): Therein can they call (at pleasure) for fruit in abundance, and (delicious) drink; Wherein, reclining, they call for plenteous fruit and cool drink (that is) therein. Reclining therein, calling therein for many fruits and drink. And beside them will be chaste women restraining their glances, (companions) of equal age. And with them are those of modest gaze, companions. And with them shall be those restraining their eyes, equals in age. Such is the Promise made, to you for the Day of Account! This it is that ye are promised for the Day of Reckoning. This is what you are promised for the day of reckoning. Truly such will be Our Bounty (to you); it will never fail;- Lo! this in truth is Our provision, which will never waste away. Most surely this is Our sustenance; it shall never come to an end;

Yea, such! but - for the wrong-doers will be an evil place of (Final) Return!- This (is for the righteous). And lo! for the transgressors there will be an evil journey's end, This (shall be so); and most surely there is an evil resort for the inordinate ones; Hell!- they will burn therein, - an evil bed (indeed, to lie on)!- Hell, where they will burn, an evil resting-place. Hell; they shall enter it, so evil is the resting-place. Yea, such! - then shall they taste it,- a boiling fluid, and a fluid dark, murky, intensely cold!- Here is a boiling and an ice-cold draught, so let them taste it, This (shall be so); so let them taste it, boiling and intensely cold (drink). And other Penalties of a similar kind, to match them! And other (torment) of the kind in pairs (the two extremes)! And other (punishment) of the same kind of various sorts. Here is a troop rushing headlong with you! No welcome for them! truly, they shall burn in the Fire! Here is an army rushing blindly with you. (Those who are already in the Fire say): No word of welcome for them. Lo! they will roast at the Fire. This is an army plunging in without consideration along with you; no welcome for them, surely they shall enter fire. (The followers shall cry to the misleaders:) "Nay, ye (too)! No welcome for you! It is ye who have brought this upon us! Now evil is (this) place to stay in!" They say: Nay, but you (misleaders), for you there is no word of welcome. Ye prepared this for us (by your misleading). Now hapless is the plight. They shall say: Nay! you no welcome to you: you did proffer it to us, so evil is the resting-place. They will say: "Our Lord! whoever brought this upon us,- Add to him a double Penalty in the Fire!" They say: Our Lord! Whoever did prepare this for us, oh, give him double portion of the Fire! They shall say: Our Lord! whoever prepared it first for us, add Thou to him a double chastisement in the fire. And they will say: "What has happened to us that we see not men whom we used to number among the bad ones?" And they say: What aileth us that we behold not men whom we were wont to count among the wicked? And they shall say: What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the vicious? "Did we treat them (as such) in ridicule, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them?" Did we take them (wrongly) for a laughing-stock, or have our eyes missed them? Was it that we (only) took them in scorn, or have our eyes (now) turned aside from them? Truly that is just and fitting,- the mutual recriminations of the People of the Fire! Lo! that is very truth: the wrangling of the dwellers in the Fire. That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire.

Say: "Truly am I a Warner: no god is there but the one God, Supreme and Irresistible,"- Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I am only a warner, and there is no God save God, the One, the Absolute, Say: I am only a warner, and there is no god but God, the One, the Subduer."", full of blessings, that they may meditate on its Signs, and that men of understanding may receive admonition.

S: And they shall say: What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the vicious? 038.063 Y: "Did we treat them (as such) in ridicule, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them?" P: Did we take them (wrongly) for a laughing-stock, or have our eyes missed them? S: Was it that we (only) took them in scorn, or have our eyes (now) turned aside from them? 038.064 Y: Truly that is just and fitting,- the mutual recriminations of the People of the Fire! P: Lo! that is very truth: the wrangling of the dwellers in the Fire. S: That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire. 038.065 Y: Say: "Truly am I a Warner: no god is there but the one God, Supreme and Irresistible,"- P: Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I am only a warner, and there is no God save God, the One, the Absolute, S: Say: I am only a warner, and there is no god but God, the One, the Subduer 
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- Exalted in Might, able to enforce His Will, forgiving again and again." Say: "That is a Message Supreme (above all)," "From which ye do turn away!" "No knowledge have I of the Chiefs on high, when they discuss (matters) among themselves." "Only this has been revealed to me: that I am to give warning plainly and publicly." Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I am about to create man from clay:" "When I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him." So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together: Not so Iblis: he was haughty, and became one of those who reject Faith. (God) said: "O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of the high (and mighty) ones?" (Iblis) said: "I am better than he: thou createdst me from fire, and him thou createdst from clay." (God) said: "Then get thee out from here: for thou art rejected, accursed." "And My curse shall be on thee till the Day of Judgment." (Iblis) said: "O my Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised." (God) said: "Respite then is granted thee-" "Till the Day of the Time Appointed." (Iblis) said: "Then, by Thy power, I will put them all in the wrong,"- "Except Thy Servants amongst them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace)." (God) said: "Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting-" "That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee,- every one." Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this (Qur'an), nor am I a pretender." "This is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds." "And ye shall certainly know the truth of it (all) after a while." - Chapter 39: AZ-ZUMAR (THE TROOPS, THRONGS) Total Verses: 75 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. The revelation of this Book is from God, the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth: so serve God, offering Him sincere devotion. Is it not to God that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than God (say): "We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to God." Truly God will judge between them in that wherein they differ. But God guides not such as are false and ungrateful. Had God wished to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He doth create: but Glory be to Him! (He is above such things.) He is God, the One, the Irresistible. He created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He makes the Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected the sun and the moon (to His law): Each one follows a course for a time appointed. Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again? He created you (all) from a single person: then created, of like nature, his mate; and he sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He makes you, in the wombs of your mothers, in stages, one after another, in three veils of darkness. Such is God, your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs (all) dominion. There is no god but He: then how are ye turned away (from your true Centre)? If ye reject (God), Truly God hath no need of you; but He liketh not ingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful, He is pleased with you. No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. In the end, to your Lord is your Return, when He will tell you the truth of all that ye did (in this life). For He knoweth well all that is in (men's) hearts. When some trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning to Him in repentance: but when He bestoweth a favour upon him as from Himself, (man) doth forget what he cried and prayed for before, and he doth set up rivals unto God, thus misleading others from God's Path. Say, "Enjoy thy blasphemy for a little while: verily thou art (one) of the Companions of the Fire! 
038.066 Y: 'The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- Exalted in Might, able to enforce His Will, forgiving again and again.' P: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty, the Pardoning. S: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Mighty, the most Forgiving. 038.067 Y: Say: 'That is a Message Supreme (above all),' P: Say: It is tremendous tidings S: Say: It is a message of importance, 038.068 Y: 'From which ye do turn away!' P: Whence ye turn away! S: (And) you are turning aside from it: 038.069 Y: 'No knowledge have I of the Chiefs on high, when they discuss (matters) among themselves.' P: I had no knowledge of the Highest Chiefs when they disputed; S: I had no knowledge of the exalted chiefs when they contended: 038.070 Y: 'Only this has been revealed to me: that I am to give warning plainly and publicly.' P: It is revealed unto me only that I may be a plain warner. S: Naught is revealed to me save that I am a plain warner. 038.071 Y: Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: 'I am about to create man from clay:' P: When thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to create a mortal out of mire, S: When your Lord said to the angels; Surely I am going to create a mortal from dust: 038.072 Y: 'When I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him.' P: And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit, then fall down before him prostrate, S: So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down making obeisance to him. 038.073 Y: So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together: P: The angels fell down prostrate, every one, S: And the angels did obeisance, all of them, 038.074 Y: Not so Iblis: he was haughty, and became one of those who reject Faith. P: Saving Iblis; he was scornful and became one of the disbelievers. S: But not Iblis: he was proud and he was one of the unbelievers. 038.075 Y: (God) said: 'O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of the high (and mighty) ones?' P: He said: O Iblis! What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that which I have created with both My hands? Art thou too proud or art thou of the high exalted? S: He said: O Iblis! what prevented you that you should do obeisance to him whom I created with My two hands? Are you proud or are you of the exalted ones? 038.076 Y: (Iblis) said: 'I am better than he: thou createdst me from fire, and him thou createdst from clay.' P: He said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire, whilst him Thou didst create of clay. S: He said: I am better than he; Thou hast created me of fire, and him Thou didst create of dust. 038.077 Y: (God) said: 'Then get thee out from here: for thou art rejected, accursed.' P: He said: Go forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast, S: He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away: 038.078 Y: 'And My curse shall be on thee till the Day of Judgment.' P: And lo! My curse is on thee till the Day of Judgment. S: And surely My curse is on you to the Day of Judgment. 038.079 Y: (Iblis) said: 'O my Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised.' P: He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised. S: He said: My Lord! then respite me to the day that they are raised. 038.080 Y: (God) said: 'Respite then is granted thee-' P: He said: Lo! thou art of those reprieved S: He said: Surely you are of the respited ones, 038.081 Y: 'Till the Day of the Time Appointed.' P: Until the day of the time appointed. S: Till the period of the time made known. 038.082 Y: (Iblis) said: 'Then, by Thy power, I will put them all in the wrong,'- P: He said: Then, by Thy might, I surely will beguile them every one, S: He said: Then by Thy Might I will surely make them live an evil life, all, 038.083 Y: 'Except Thy Servants amongst them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace).' P: Save Thy single-minded slaves among them. S: Except Thy servants from among them, the purified ones. 038.084 Y: (God) said: 'Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting-' P: He said: The Truth is, and the Truth I speak, S: He said: The truth then is and the truth do I speak: 038.085 Y: 'That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee,- every one.' P: That I shall fill hell with thee and with such of them as follow thee, together. S: That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with those among them who follow you, all. 038.086 Y: Say: 'No reward do I ask of you for this (Qur'an), nor am I a pretender.' P: Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee for this, and I am no simulating. S: Say: I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of those who affect: 038.087 Y: 'This is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds.' P: Lo! it is naught else than a reminder for all peoples S: It is nothing but a reminder to the nations; 038.088 Y: 'And ye shall certainly know the truth of it (all) after a while.' P: And ye will come in time to know the truth thereof. S: And most certainly you will come to know about it after a time. - Chapter 39: AZ-ZUMAR (THE TROOPS, THRONGS) Total Verses: 75 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 039.001 Y: The revelation of this Book is from God, the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. P: The revelation of the Scripture is from God, the Mighty, the Wise. S: The revelation of the Book is from God, the Mighty, the Wise. 039.002 Y: Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth: so serve God, offering Him sincere devotion. P: Lo! We have revealed the Scripture unto thee (Muhammad) with truth; so worship God, making religion pure for Him (only). S: Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, therefore serve God, being sincere to Him in obedience. 039.003 Y: Is it not to God that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than God (say): 'We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to God.' Truly God will judge between them in that wherein they differ. But God guides not such as are false and ungrateful. P: Surely pure religion is for God only. And those who choose protecting friends beside Him (say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto God. Lo! God will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Lo! God guideth not him who is a liar, an ingrate. S: Now, surely, sincere obedience is due to God (alone) and (as for) those who take guardians besides Him, (saying), We do not serve them save that they may make us nearer to God, surely God will judge between them in that in which they differ; surely God does not guide him aright who is a liar, ungrateful. 039.004 Y: Had God wished to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He doth create: but Glory be to Him! (He is above such things.) He is God, the One, the Irresistible. P: If God had willed to choose a son, He could have chosen what He would of that which He hath created. Be He Glorified! He is God, the One, the Absolute. S: If God desire to take a son to Himself, He will surely choose those He pleases from what He has created. Glory be to Him: He is God, the One, the Subduer (of all). 039.005 Y: He created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He makes the Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected the sun and the moon (to His law): Each one follows a course for a time appointed. Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again? P: He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. He maketh night to succeed day, and He maketh day to succeed night, and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service, each running on for an appointed term. Is not He the Mighty, the Forgiver? S: He has created the heavens and the earth with the truth; He makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake the night, and He has made the sun and the moon subservient; each one runs on to an assigned term; now surely He is the Mighty, the great Forgiver. 039.006 Y: He created you (all) from a single person: then created, of like nature, his mate; and he sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He makes you, in the wombs of your mothers, in stages, one after another, in three veils of darkness. Such is God, your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs (all) dominion. There is no god but He: then how are ye turned away (from your true Centre)? P: He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its mate; and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in a threefold gloom. Such is God, your Lord. His is the Sovereignty. There is no God save Him. How then are ye turned away? S: He has created you from a single being, then made its mate of the same (kind), and He has made for you eight of the cattle in pairs. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers a creation after a creation in triple darkness; that is God your Lord, His is the kingdom; there is no god but He; whence are you then turned away? 039.007 Y: If ye reject (God), Truly God hath no need of you; but He liketh not ingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful, He is pleased with you. No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. In the end, to your Lord is your Return, when He will tell you the truth of all that ye did (in this life). For He knoweth well all that is in (men's) hearts. P: If ye are thankless, yet God is Independent of you, though He is not pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith for you. No laden soul will bear another's load. Then unto your Lord is your return; and He will tell you what ye used to do. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men). S: If you are ungrateful, then surely God is Self-sufficient above all need of you; and He does not like ungratefulness in His servants; and if you are grateful, He likes it in you; and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, then will He inform you of what you did; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts. 039.008 Y: When some trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning to Him in repentance: but when He bestoweth a favour upon him as from Himself, (man) doth forget what he cried and prayed for before, and he doth set up rivals unto God, thus misleading others from God's Path. Say, 'Enjoy thy blasphemy for a little while: verily thou art (one) of the Companions of the Fire!' P: And when some hurt toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning unto Him (repentant). Then, when He granteth him a boon from Him he forgetteth that for which he cried unto Him before, and setteth up rivals to God t""hat he may beguile (men) from his way. Say (O Muhammad, unto such a one): Take pleasure in thy disbelief a while. Lo! thou art of the owners of the Fire. And when distress afflicts a man he calls upon his Lord turning to Him frequently; then when He makes him possess a favor from Him, he forgets that for which he called upon Him before, and sets up rivals to God that he may cause (men) to stray off from His path. Say: Enjoy yourself in your ungratefulness a little, surely you are of the inmates of the fire. Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself or standing (in adoration), who takes heed of the Hereafter, and who places his hope in the Mercy of his Lord - (like one who does not)? Say: Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition. Is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night, prostrate and standing, bewaring of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, (to be accounted equal with a disbeliever)? Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Are those who know equal with those who know not? But only men of understanding will pay heed. What! he who is obedient during hours of the night, prostrating himself and standing, takes care of the hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord! Say: Are those who know and those who do not know alike? Only the men of understanding are mindful. Say: O ye my servants who believe! Fear your Lord, good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world. Spacious is God's earth! those who patiently persevere will truly receive a reward without measure! Say: O My bondmen who believe! Observe your duty to your Lord. For those who do good in this world there is good, and God's earth is spacious. Verily the steadfast will be paid their wages without stint. Say: O my servants who believe! be careful of (your duty to) your Lord; for those who do good in this world is good, and God's earth is spacious; only the patient will be paid back their reward in full without measure. Say: Verily, I am commanded to serve God with sincere devotion; Say (O Muhammad): Lo! I am commanded to worship God, making religion pure for Him (only). Say: I am commanded that I should serve God, being sincere to Him in obedience. And I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to God in Islam. And I am commanded to be the first of those who are Muslims (surrender unto Him). And I am commanded that I shall be the first of those who submit. Say: I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the Penalty of a Mighty Day. Say: Lo! if I should disobey my Lord, I fear the doom of a tremendous Day. Say: I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the chastisement of a grievous day. Say: It is God I serve, with my sincere (and exclusive) devotion: Say: God I worship, making my religion pure for Him (only). Say: God (it is Whom) I serve, being sincere to Him in my obedience: Serve ye what ye will besides him. Say: Truly, those in loss are those who lose their own souls and their People on the Day of Judgment: Ah! that is indeed the (real and) evident Loss! Then worship what ye will beside Him. Say: The losers will be those who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Ah, that will be the manifest loss! Serve then what you like besides Him. Say: The losers surely are those who shall have lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection; now surely that is the clear loss. They shall have Layers of Fire above them, and Layers (of Fire) below them: with this doth God warn off his servants: O My Servants! then fear ye Me! They have an awning of fire above them and beneath them a dais (of fire). With this doth God appall His bondmen. O My bondmen, therefore fear Me! They shall have coverings of fire above them and coverings beneath them; with that God makes His servants to fear, so be careful of (your duty to) Me, O My servants! Those who eschew Evil,- and fall not into its worship,- and turn to God (in repentance),- for them is Good News: so announce the Good News to My Servants,- And those who put away false gods lest they should worship them and turn to God in repentance, for them there are glad tidings. Therefore give good tidings (O Muhammad) to My bondmen And (as for) those who keep off from the worship of the idols and turn to God, they shall have good news, therefore give good news to My servants, Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best (meaning) in it: those are the ones whom God has guided, and those are the ones endued with understanding. Who hear advice and follow the best thereof. Such are those whom God guideth, and such are men of understanding. Those who listen to the word, then follow the best of it; those are they whom God has guided, and those it is who are the men of understanding. Is, then, one against whom the decree of Punishment is justly due (equal to one who eschews Evil)? Wouldst thou, then, deliver one (who is) in the Fire? Is he on whom the word of doom is fulfilled (to be helped), and canst thou (O Muhammad) rescue him who is in the Fire? What! as for him then against whom the sentence of chastisement is due: What! can you save him who is in the fire? But it is for those who fear their Lord. That lofty mansions, one above another, have been built: beneath them flow rivers (of delight): (such is) the Promise of God: never doth God fail in (His) promise. But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are lofty halls with lofty halls above them, built (for them), beneath which rivers flow. (It is) a promise of God. God faileth not His promise. But (as for) those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have high places, above them higher places, built (for them), beneath which flow rivers; (this is) the promise of God: God will not fail in (His) promise. Seest thou not that God sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through springs in the earth? Then He causes to grow, therewith, produce of various colours: then it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it dry up and crumble away. Truly, in this, is a Message of remembrance to men of understanding. Hast thou not seen how God hath sent down water from the sky and hath caused it to penetrate the earth as watersprings, and afterward thereby produceth crops of divers hues; and afterward they wither and thou seest them turn yellow; then He maketh them chaff. Lo! herein verily is a reminder for men of understanding. Do you not see that God sends down water from the cloud, then makes it go along in the earth in springs, then brings forth therewith herbage of various colors, then it withers so that you see it becoming yellow, then He makes it a thing crushed and broken into pieces? Most surely there is a reminder in this for the men of understanding. Is one whose heart God has opened to Islam, so that he has received Enlightenment from God, (no better than one hard-hearted)? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against celebrating the praises of God! they are manifestly wandering (in error)! Is he whose bosom God hath expanded for Al-Islam, so that he followeth a light from his Lord, (as he who disbelieveth)? Then woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of God. Such are in plain error. What! is he whose heart God has opened for Islam so that he is in a light from his Lord (like the hard-hearted)? Nay, woe to those whose hearts are hard against the remembrance of God; those are in clear error. God has revealed (from time to time) the most beautiful Message in the form of a Book, consistent with itself, (yet) repeating (its teaching in various aspects): the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat; then their skins and their hearts do soften to the celebration of God's praises. Such is the guidance of God: He guides therewith whom He pleases, but such as God leaves to stray, can have none to guide. God hath (now) revealed the fairest of statements, a Scripture consistent, (wherein promises of reward are) paired (with threats of punishment), whereat doth creep the flesh of those who fear their Lord, so that their flesh and their hearts soften to God's reminder. Such is God's guidance, wherewith He guideth whom He will. And him whom God sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. God has revealed the best announcement, a book conformable in its various parts, repeating, whereat do shudder the skins of those who fear their Lord, then their skins and their hearts become pliant to the remembrance of God; this is God's guidance, He guides with it whom He pleases; and (as for) him whom God makes err, there is no guide for him. Is, then, one who has to fear the brunt of the Penalty on the Day of Judgment (and receive it) on his face, (like one guarded therefrom)? It will be said to the wrong-doers: Taste ye (the fruits of) what ye earned! Is he then, who will strike his face against the awful doom upon the Day of Resurrection (as he who doeth right)? And it will be said unto the wrong-doers: Taste what ye used to earn. Is he then who has to guard himself with his own person against the evil chastisement on the resurrection day? And it will be said to the unjust: Taste what you earned. Those before them (also) rejected (revelation), and so the Punishment came to them from directions they did not perceive. Those before them denied, and so the doom came on them whence they knew not. Those before them rejected (prophets), therefore there came to them the chastisement from whence they perceived not. So God gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life, but greater is the punishment of the Hereafter, if they only knew! Thus God made them taste humiliation in the life of the world, and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be greater if they did but know. So God made them taste the disgrace in this world's life, and certainly the punishment of the hereafter is greater; did they but know! We have put forth for men, in this Qur'an every kind of Parable, in order that they may receive admonition. And verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of similitudes, that haply they may reflect; And certainly We have set forth to men in this Quran similitudes of every sort that they may mind. (It is) a Qur'an in Arabic, without any crookedness (therein): in order that they may guard against Evil. A Lecture in Arabic, containing no crookedness, that haply they may ward off (evil). An Arabic Quran without any crookedness, that they may guard (against evil).God puts forth a parable: a man belonging to many partners at variance with each other, and a man belonging entirely to one master. Are those two equal in comparison? Praise be to God! But most of them have no knowledge.

Truly, you will die (one day), and they (too) will die (one day). In the end, on the Day of Judgment, you will settle your disputes in the presence of your Lord.

Who does more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning God and rejects the Truth when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell an abode for blasphemers? And he who brings the Truth and he who confirms it—such are the men who do right. They shall have all that they wish for in the presence of their Lord; such is the reward of those who do good. So that God will turn off from them the worst in their deeds and give them their reward according to the best of what they have done.

Is not God enough for His servant? But they try to frighten you with other gods besides Him! For such as God leaves to stray, there can be no guide. And such as God guides, there can be none to lead astray. Is not God Exalted in Power, Able to enforce His Will, Lord of Retribution?

If you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they would say, "God." Say: "See then, the things that you invoke besides God—can they, if God wills some penalty for me, remove His penalty? Or if He wills some grace for me, can they keep back His grace?" Say: "Sufficient is God for me! In Him trust those who put their trust."

Say: "O my people! Do whatever you can; I will do my part. But soon you will know who it is to whom comes a penalty of ignominy, and on whom descends a penalty that abides."

Verily, We have revealed the Book to you in Truth, for instructing mankind. He who receives guidance benefits his own soul, but he who strays injures his own soul. Nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs.

It is God that takes the souls of men at death and those that die not during their sleep. Those on whom He has passed the decree of death, He keeps back, but the rest He sends back for a term appointed. Verily, in this are signs for those who reflect.

What! Do they take for intercessors others besides God? Say: "Even if they have no power whatever and no intelligence?" Say: "To God belongs exclusively the right to grant intercession. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. In the end, it is to Him that you shall be brought back."

When God, the One and Only, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are filled with disgust and horror. But when gods other than He are mentioned, they are filled with joy.

Say: "O God! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of all that is hidden and open! It is You who will judge between Your servants in those matters about which they have differed."

Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth and as much more, they would offer it for ransom from the pain of the penalty on the Day of Judgment. But something will confront them from God, which they could never have counted upon. For the evils of their deeds will confront them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at.

Now, when trouble touches man, he cries to Us. But when We bestow a favor upon him as from Ourselves, he says, "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge I have!" Nay, but this is a trial, but most of them understand not. Thus did the generations before them say! But all that they did was of no profit to them. The evil results of their deeds overtook them.hat he may beguile (men) from his way. Say (O Muhammad, unto such a one): Take pleasure in thy disbelief a while. Lo! thou art of the owners of the Fire. S: And when distress afflicts a man he calls upon his Lord turning to Him frequently; then when He makes him possess a favor from Him, he forgets that for which he called upon Him before, and sets up rivals to God that he may cause (men) to stray off from His path. Say: Enjoy yourself in your ungratefulness a little, surely you are of the inmates of the fire. 039.009 Y: Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself or standing (in adoration), who takes heed of the Hereafter, and who places his hope in the Mercy of his Lord - (like one who does not)? Say: "Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition." P: Is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night, prostrate and standing, bewaring of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, (to be accounted equal with a disbeliever)? Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Are those who know equal with those who know not? But only men of understanding will pay heed. S: What! he who is obedient during hours of the night, prostrating himself and standing, takes care of the hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord! Say: Are those who know and those who do not know alike? Only the men of understanding are mindful. 039.010 Y: Say: "O ye my servants who believe! Fear your Lord, good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world. Spacious is God's earth! those who patiently persevere will truly receive a reward without measure!" P: Say: O My bondmen who believe! Observe your duty to your Lord. For those who do good in this world there is good, and God's earth is spacious. Verily the steadfast will be paid their wages without stint. S: Say: O my servants who believe! be careful of (your duty to) your Lord; for those who do good in this world is good, and God's earth is spacious; only the patient will be paid back their reward in full without measure. 039.011 Y: Say: "Verily, I am commanded to serve God with sincere devotion;" P: Say (O Muhammad): Lo! I am commanded to worship God, making religion pure for Him (only). S: Say: I am commanded that I should serve God, being sincere to Him in obedience. 039.012Y: "And I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to God in Islam." P: And I am commanded to be the first of those who are Muslims (surrender unto Him). S: And I am commanded that I shall be the first of those who submit. 039.013Y: Say: "I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the Penalty of a Mighty Day." P: Say: Lo! if I should disobey my Lord, I fear the doom of a tremendous Day. S: Say: I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the chastisement of a grievous day. 039.014 Y: Say: "It is God I serve, with my sincere (and exclusive) devotion:" P: Say: God I worship, making my religion pure for Him (only). S: Say: God (it is Whom) I serve, being sincere to Him in my obedience: 039.015Y: "Serve ye what ye will besides him." Say: "Truly, those in loss are those who lose their own souls and their People on the Day of Judgment: Ah! that is indeed the (real and) evident Loss!" P: Then worship what ye will beside Him. Say: The losers will be those who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Ah, that will be the manifest loss! S: Serve then what you like besides Him. Say: The losers surely are those who shall have lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection; now surely that is the clear loss. 039.016 Y: They shall have Layers of Fire above them, and Layers (of Fire) below them: with this doth God warn off his servants: "O My Servants! then fear ye Me!" P: They have an awning of fire above them and beneath them a dais (of fire). With this doth God appall His bondmen. O My bondmen, therefore fear Me! S: They shall have coverings of fire above them and coverings beneath them; with that God makes His servants to fear, so be careful of (your duty to) Me, O My servants! 039.017Y: Those who eschew Evil,- and fall not into its worship,- and turn to God (in repentance),- for them is Good News: so announce the Good News to My Servants,- P: And those who put away false gods lest they should worship them and turn to God in repentance, for them there are glad tidings. Therefore give good tidings (O Muhammad) to My bondmen S: And (as for) those who keep off from the worship of the idols and turn to God, they shall have good news, therefore give good news to My servants, 039.018 Y: Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best (meaning) in it: those are the ones whom God has guided, and those are the ones endued with understanding. P: Who hear advice and follow the best thereof. Such are those whom God guideth, and such are men of understanding. S: Those who listen to the word, then follow the best of it; those are they whom God has guided, and those it is who are the men of understanding. 039.019 Y: Is, then, one against whom the decree of Punishment is justly due (equal to one who eschews Evil)? Wouldst thou, then, deliver one (who is) in the Fire? P: Is he on whom the word of doom is fulfilled (to be helped), and canst thou (O Muhammad) rescue him who is in the Fire? S: What! as for him then against whom the sentence of chastisement is due: What! can you save him who is in the fire? 039.020 Y: But it is for those who fear their Lord. That lofty mansions, one above another, have been built: beneath them flow rivers (of delight): (such is) the Promise of God: never doth God fail in (His) promise. P: But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are lofty halls with lofty halls above them, built (for them), beneath which rivers flow. (It is) a promise of God. God faileth not His promise. S: But (as for) those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have high places, above them higher places, built (for them), beneath which flow rivers; (this is) the promise of God: God will not fail in (His) promise. 039.021 Y: Seest thou not that God sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through springs in the earth? Then He causes to grow, therewith, produce of various colours: then it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it dry up and crumble away. Truly, in this, is a Message of remembrance to men of understanding. P: Hast thou not seen how God hath sent down water from the sky and hath caused it to penetrate the earth as watersprings, and afterward thereby produceth crops of divers hues; and afterward they wither and thou seest them turn yellow; then He maketh them chaff. Lo! herein verily is a reminder for men of understanding. S: Do you not see that God sends down water from the cloud, then makes it go along in the earth in springs, then brings forth therewith herbage of various colors, then it withers so that you see it becoming yellow, then He makes it a thing crushed and broken into pieces? Most surely there is a reminder in this for the men of understanding. 039.022Y: Is one whose heart God has opened to Islam, so that he has received Enlightenment from God, (no better than one hard-hearted)? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against celebrating the praises of God! they are manifestly wandering (in error)! P: Is he whose bosom God hath expanded for Al-Islam, so that he followeth a light from his Lord, (as he who disbelieveth)? Then woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of God. Such are in plain error. S: What! is he whose heart God has opened for Islam so that he is in a light from his Lord (like the hard-hearted)? Nay, woe to those whose hearts are hard against the remembrance of God; those are in clear error. 039.023 Y: God has revealed (from time to time) the most beautiful Message in the form of a Book, consistent with itself, (yet) repeating (its teaching in various aspects): the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat; then their skins and their hearts do soften to the celebration of God's praises. Such is the guidance of God: He guides therewith whom He pleases, but such as God leaves to stray, can have none to guide. P: God hath (now) revealed the fairest of statements, a Scripture consistent, (wherein promises of reward are) paired (with threats of punishment), whereat doth creep the flesh of those who fear their Lord, so that their flesh and their hearts soften to God's reminder. Such is God's guidance, wherewith He guideth whom He will. And him whom God sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. S: God has revealed the best announcement, a book conformable in its various parts, repeating, whereat do shudder the skins of those who fear their Lord, then their skins and their hearts become pliant to the remembrance of God; this is God's guidance, He guides with it whom He pleases; and (as for) him whom God makes err, there is no guide for him. 039.024 Y: Is, then, one who has to fear the brunt of the Penalty on the Day of Judgment (and receive it) on his face, (like one guarded therefrom)? It will be said to the wrong-doers: "Taste ye (the fruits of) what ye earned!" P: Is he then, who will strike his face against the awful doom upon the Day of Resurrection (as he who doeth right)? And it will be said unto the wrong-doers: Taste what ye used to earn. S: Is he then who has to guard himself with his own person against the evil chastisement on the resurrection day? And it will be said to the unjust: Taste what you earned. 039.025 Y: Those before them (also) rejected (revelation), and so the Punishment came to them from directions they did not perceive. P: Those before them denied, and so the doom came on them whence they knew not. S: Those before them rejected (prophets), therefore there came to them the chastisement from whence they perceived not. 039.026 Y: So God gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life, but greater is the punishment of the Hereafter, if they only knew! P: Thus God made them taste humiliation in the life of the world, and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be greater if they did but know. S: So God made them taste the disgrace in this world's life, and certainly the punishment of the hereafter is greater; did they but know! 039.027 Y: We have put forth for men, in this Qur'an every kind of Parable, in order that they may receive admonition. P: And verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of similitudes, that haply they may reflect; S: And certainly We have set forth to men in this Quran similitudes of every sort that they may mind. 039.028 Y: (It is) a Qur'an in Arabic, without any crookedness (therein): in order that they may guard against Evil. P: A Lecture in Arabic, containing no crookedness, that haply they may ward off (evil). S: An Arabic Quran without any crookedness, that they may guard (against evil). 039.029 Y:-doers of this generation- the evil results of their deeds will soon overtake them too, and they will never be able to frustrate Our Plan! But the evils that they earned smote them; and such of these as do wrong, the evils that they earn will smite them; they cannot escape. So there befell them the evil consequences of what they earned; and as for those who are unjust from among these, there shall befall them the evil consequences of what they earn, and they shall not escape.

Know they not that God enlarges the provision or restricts it, for any He pleases? Verily, in this are Signs for those who believe! Do they not know that God makes ample the means of subsistence to whom He pleases, and He straitens; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.

Say: "O my Servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of God: for God forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." Say: O My slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt! Despair not of the mercy of God, Who forgiveth all sins. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say: O my servants! who have acted extravagantly against their own souls, do not despair of the mercy of God; surely God forgives the faults altogether; surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful.

"Turn ye to our Lord in repentance and bow to His Will, before the Penalty comes on you: after that ye shall not be helped." Turn unto your Lord repentant, and surrender unto Him, before there come unto you the doom, when ye cannot be helped. And return to your Lord time after time and submit to Him before there comes to you the punishment, then you shall not be helped.

"And follow the best of the courses revealed to you from your Lord, before the Penalty comes on you - of a sudden while ye perceive not!" And follow the better guidance of that which is revealed unto you from your Lord, before the doom cometh on you suddenly when ye know not, And follow the best that has been revealed to you from your Lord before there comes to you the punishment all of a sudden while you do not even perceive;

"Lest the soul should then say: 'Ah! Woe is me!- In that I neglected my duty towards God, and was but among those who mocked!'" Lest any soul should say: Alas, my grief that I was unmindful of God, and I was indeed among the scoffers! Lest a soul should say: O woe to me! for what I fell short of my duty to God, and most surely I was of those who laughed to scorn;

"Or lest it should say: 'If only God had guided me, I should certainly have been among the righteous!'" Or should say: If God had but guided me I should have been among the dutiful! Or it should say: Had God guided me, I would certainly have been of those who guard against evil;

"Or lest it should say when it actually sees the penalty: 'If only I had another chance, I should certainly be among those who do good!'" Or should say, when it seeth the doom: Oh, that I had but a second chance that I might be among the righteous! Or it should say when it sees the punishment: Were there only a returning for me, I should be of the doers of good.

"The reply will be: 'Nay, but there came to thee my Signs, and thou didst reject them: thou wast Haughty, and became one of those who reject faith!'" But now the answer will be: Nay, for My revelations came unto thee, but thou didst deny them and wast scornful and wast among the disbelievers. Aye! My communications came to you, but you rejected them, and you were proud and you were one of the unbelievers.

On the Day of Judgment wilt thou see those who told lies against God; their faces will be turned black; is there not in Hell an abode for the Haughty? And on the Day of Resurrection thou seest those who lied concerning God with their faces blackened. Is not the home of the scorners in hell? And on the day of resurrection you shall see those who lied against God; their faces shall be blackened. Is there not in hell an abode for the proud?

But God will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation: no evil shall touch them, nor shall they grieve. And God delivereth those who ward off evil because of their deserts. Evil toucheth them not, nor do they grieve. And God shall deliver those who guard against evil with their achievement; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve.

God is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all affairs. God is Creator of all things, and He is Guardian over all things. God is the Creator of every thing and He has charge over every thing.

To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: and those who reject the Signs of God, it is they who will be in loss. His are the keys of the heavens and the earth, and they who disbelieve the revelations of God - such are they who are the losers. His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; and as for those who disbelieve in the communications of God, these it is that are the losers.

Say: "Is it some one other than God that ye order me to worship, O ye ignorant ones?" Say O Muhammad, to the disbelievers: Do ye bid me serve other than God? O ye fools! Say: What! Do you then bid me serve others than God, O ignorant men?

But it has already been revealed to thee, as it was to those before thee, "If thou wert to join gods with God, truly fruitless will be thy work in life, and thou wilt surely be in the ranks of those who lose all spiritual good." And verily it hath been revealed unto thee as unto those before thee saying: If thou ascribe a partner to God thy work will fail and thou indeed wilt be among the losers. And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those before you: Surely if you associate with God, your work would certainly come to naught and you would certainly be of the losers.

Nay, but worship God, and be of those who give thanks. Nay, but God must thou serve, and be among the thankful! Nay! but serve God alone and be of the thankful.

No just estimate have they made of God, such as is due to Him: On the Day of Judgment the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the heavens will be rolled up in His right hand: Glory to Him! High is He above the Partners they attribute to Him! And they esteem not God as He hath the right to be esteemed, when the whole earth is His handful on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens are rolled in His right hand. Glorified is He and High Exalted from all that they ascribe as partner unto Him. And they have not honored God with the honor that is due to Him; and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right hand; glory be to Him, and may He be exalted above what they associate with Him.

The Trumpet will just be sounded, when all that are in the heavens and on earth will swoon, except such as it will please God to exempt. Then will a second one be sounded, when, behold, they will be standing and looking on! And the trumpet is blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth swoon away, save him whom God willeth. Then it is blown a second time, and behold them standing waiting! And the trumpet shall be blown, so all those that are in the heavens and all those that are in the earth shall swoon, except such as God please; then it shall be blown again, then lo! they shall stand up awaiting.

And the Earth will shine with the Glory of its Lord: the Record of Deeds will be placed open; the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward and a just decision pronounced between them; and they will not be wronged in the least. And the earth shineth with the light of her Lord, and the Book is set up, and the prophets and the witnesses are brought, and it is judged between them with truth, and they are not wronged. And the earth shall beam with the light of its Lord, and the Book shall be laid down, and the prophets and the witnesses shall be brought up, and judgment shall be given between them with justice, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.

And to every soul will be paid in full the fruit of its Deeds; and God knoweth best all that they do. And each soul is paid in full for what it did. And He is Best Aware of what they do. And every soul shall be paid back fully what it has done, and He knows best what they do.

The Unbelievers will be led to Hell in crowd: until, when they arrive, there, its gates will be opened. And its keepers will say, "Did not messengers come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of This Day of yours?" The answer will be: "True: but the Decree of Punishment has been proved true against the Unbelievers!" And those who disbelieve are driven unto hell in troops till, when they reach it and the gates thereof are opened, and the warders thereof say unto them: Came there not unto you messengers of your own, reciting unto you the revelations of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this your Day? they say: Yea, verily. But the word of doom of disbelievers is fulfilled. And those who disbelieve shall be driven to hell in companies; until, when they come to it, its doors shall be opened, and the keepers of it shall say to them: Did not there come to you messengers from among you reciting to you the communications of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours? They shall say: Yea! But the sentence of punishment was due against the unbelievers.

To them will be said: "Enter ye the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: and evil is this Abode of the Arrogant!" It is said unto them: Enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein. Thus hapless is the journey's end of the scorners. It shall be said: Enter the gates of hell to abide therein; so evil is the abode of the proud.

And those who feared their Lord will be led to the Garden in crowds: until behold, they arrive there; its gates will be opened; and its keepers will say: "Peace be upon you! well have ye done! enter ye here, to dwell therein." And those who keep their duty to their Lord are driven unto the Garden in troops till, when they reach it, and the gates thereof are opened, and the warders thereof say unto them: Peace be unto you! Ye are good, so enter ye the Garden of delight, to dwell therein; And those who are careful of their duty to their Lord shall be conveyed to the"God puts forth a parable: a man belonging to many partners at variance with each other, and a man belonging entirely to one master. Are those two equal in comparison? Praise be to God! But most of them have no knowledge. Truly, you will die (one day), and they (too) will die (one day). In the end, on the Day of Judgment, you will settle your disputes in the presence of your Lord. Who does more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning God and rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell an abode for blasphemers? And he who brings the truth and he who confirms it - such are the men who do right. They shall have all that they wish for in the presence of their Lord: such is the reward of those who do good. So that God will turn off from them the worst in their deeds and give them their reward according to the best of what they have done. Is not God enough for His servant? But they try to frighten you with other (gods) besides Him! For such as God leaves to stray, there can be no guide. And such as God guides, there can be none to lead astray. Is not God Exalted in Power, Able to enforce His Will, Lord of Retribution? If you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they would say, 'God.' Say: 'See then? The things that you invoke besides God, can they, if God wills some penalty for me, remove His penalty? Or if He wills some grace for me, can they keep back His grace?' Say: 'Sufficient is God for me! In Him trust those who put their trust.' Say: 'O my people! Do whatever you can: I will do my part: but soon you will know who it is to whom comes a penalty of ignominy, and on whom descends a penalty that abides.' Verily, We have revealed the Book to you in truth, for instructing mankind. He who receives guidance benefits his own soul, but he who strays injures his own soul. Nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs. It is God that takes the souls of men at death, and those that die not (He takes) during their sleep. Those on whom He has passed the decree of death, He keeps back, but the rest He sends to their bodies for a term appointed. Verily, in this are signs for those who reflect. What! Do they take for intercessors others besides God? Say: 'Even if they have no power whatever and no intelligence?' Say: 'To God belongs exclusively the right to grant intercession: to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: in the end, it is to Him that you shall be brought back.' When God, the One and Only, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are filled with disgust and horror; but when gods other than He are mentioned, they are filled with joy! Say: 'O God! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of all that is hidden and open! It is You who will judge between Your servants in those matters about which they have differed.' Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth, and as much more, they would offer it for ransom from the pain of the penalty on the Day of Judgment. But something will confront them from God, which they could never have counted upon! For the evils of their deeds will confront them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at! Now, when trouble touches man, he cries to Us. But when We bestow a favor upon him as from Ourselves, he says, 'This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge I have!' Nay, but this is but a trial, but most of them understand not! Thus did the generations before them say! But all that they did was of no profit to them. Nay, the evil results of their deeds overtook them."garden in companies; until when they come to it, and its doors shall be opened, and the keepers of it shall say to them: Peace be on you, you shall be happy; therefore enter it to abide. They will say: "Praise be to God, Who has truly fulfilled His Promise to us, and has given us this land in heritage: We can dwell in the Garden as we will: how excellent a reward for those who work righteousness!" And thou wilt see the angels surrounding the Throne on all sides, singing Glory and Praise to their Lord. The Decision between them will be in perfect justice, and the cry will be, "Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds!" 

Chapter 40: AL-GHAFIR (THE FORGIVER) Total Verses: 85 Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Ha Mim. The revelation of this Book is from God, Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge, Who forgiveth sin, accepteth repentance, is strict in punishment, and hath a long reach in all things. There is no god but He: to Him is the final goal. None can dispute about the Signs of God but the Unbelievers. Let not, then, their strutting about through the land deceive thee! But there were people before them, who denied the Signs, the People of Noah, and the Confederates of Evil after them; and every People plotted against their prophet, to seize him, and disputed by means of vanities, therewith to condemn the Truth; but it was I that seized them! And how terrible was My Requital! Thus was the Decree of thy Lord proved true against the Unbelievers; that truly they are Companions of the Fire!

Those who sustain the Throne of God and those around it sing Glory and Praise to their Lord; believe in Him; and implore Forgiveness for those who believe: "Our Lord! Thy Reach is over all things, in Mercy and Knowledge. Forgive, then, those who turn in Repentance, and follow Thy Path; and preserve them from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire! And grant, our Lord, that they enter the Gardens of Eternity, which Thou hast promised to them, and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their posterity! For Thou art He, the Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom. And preserve them from all ills; and any whom Thou dost preserve from ills that Day, on them wilt Thou have bestowed Mercy indeed: and that will be truly for them the highest Achievement."

The Unbelievers will be addressed: "Greater was the aversion of God to you than is your aversion to yourselves, seeing that ye were called to the Faith and ye used to refuse." They will say: "Our Lord! twice hast Thou made us without life, and twice hast Thou given us Life! Now have we recognized our sins: Is there any way out of this?" The answer will be: "This is because, when God was invoked as the Only object of worship, ye did reject Faith, but when partners were joined to Him, ye believed! The Command is with God, Most High, Most Great!"

He it is Who showeth you His Signs, and sendeth down sustenance for you from the sky: but only those receive admonition who turn to God. Call ye, then, upon God with sincere devotion to Him, even though the Unbelievers may detest it. Raised high above ranks, He is the Lord of the Throne of Authority: by His Command doth He send the Spirit of inspiration to any of His servants He pleases, that it may warn men of the Day of Mutual Meeting. The Day whereon they will all come forth: not a single thing concerning them is hidden from God. Whose will be the dominion that Day? That of God, the One the Irresistible! That Day will every soul be requited for what it earned; no injustice will there be that Day, for God is Swift in taking account. Warn them of the Day that is ever drawing near, when the hearts will come right up to the throats to choke them; No intimate friend nor intercessor will the wrong-doers have, who could be listened to. God knows of the tricks that deceive with the eyes, and all that the hearts of men conceal.-doers of this generation- the evil results of their deeds will soon overtake them, and they will never be able to frustrate Our Plan! But the evils that they earned smote them; and such of these as do wrong, the evils that they earn will smite them; they cannot escape. Know they not that God enlarges the provision or restricts it, for any He pleases? Verily, in this are Signs for those who believe! Say: "O my Servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of God: for God forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." Turn to your Lord in repentance and bow to His Will, before the Penalty comes on you: after that, you shall not be helped. And follow the best of the courses revealed to you from your Lord, before the Penalty comes on you suddenly while you perceive not! Lest the soul should then say: 'Ah! Woe is me! In that I neglected my duty towards God, and was among those who mocked!' Or it should say: 'If only God had guided me, I should certainly have been among the righteous!' Or it should say when it actually sees the penalty: 'If only I had another chance, I should certainly be among those who do good!' The reply will be: 'Nay, but there came to you My Signs, and you did reject them: you were haughty and became one of those who reject faith!' On the Day of Judgment, you will see those who told lies against God; their faces will be turned black. Is there not in Hell an abode for the haughty? But God will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation: no evil shall touch them, nor shall they grieve. God is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all affairs. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: and those who reject the Signs of God, it is they who will be in loss. Say: "Is it someone other than God that you order me to worship, O ignorant ones?" But it has already been revealed to you, as it was to those before you: "If you were to join gods with God, truly fruitless will be your work in life, and you will surely be in the ranks of those who lose all spiritual good." Nay, but worship God, and be of those who give thanks. No just estimate have they made of God, such as is due to Him: On the Day of Judgment, the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the heavens will be rolled up in His right hand. Glory to Him! High is He above the partners they attribute to Him! The Trumpet will be sounded, when all that are in the heavens and on earth will swoon, except such as it will please God to exempt. Then a second one will be sounded, when, behold, they will be standing and looking on! And the Earth will shine with the Glory of its Lord: the Record of Deeds will be placed open; the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward, and a just decision pronounced between them; and they will not be wronged in the least. And to every soul will be paid in full the fruit of its deeds; and God knows best all that they do. The Unbelievers will be led to Hell in crowds: until, when they arrive there, its gates will be opened. And its keepers will say, "Did not messengers come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of This Day of yours?" The answer will be: "True: but the Decree of Punishment has been proved true against the Unbelievers!" To them will be said: "Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: and evil is this Abode of the Arrogant!" And those who feared their Lord will be led to the Garden in crowds: until, behold, they arrive there; its gates will be opened; and its keepers will say: "Peace be upon you! Well have you done! Enter here, to dwell therein."He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal. And God will judge with justice and truth: but those whom men invoke besides Him will not judge at all. Verily it is God alone who hears and sees all things. Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them? They were even superior to them in strength and in the traces they have left in the land: but God called them to account for their sins, and none had they to defend them against God. That was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs, but they disbelieved; so God seized them. He is strong, severe in punishment. Of old, We sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority to Pharaoh, Haman, and Qarun; but they called him a sorcerer telling lies. When he came to them in truth from Us, they said, "Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and keep alive their females," but the plots of unbelievers end in nothing but errors. Pharaoh said, "Leave me to slay Moses; and let him call on his Lord! What I fear is lest he should change your religion, or cause mischief to appear in the land!" Moses said, "I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord for protection from every arrogant one who believes not in the Day of Account!" A believer from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said, "Will you slay a man because he says, 'My Lord is God'? If he is lying, on him is the sin of his lie: but if he is telling the truth, then something of the calamity of which he warns you will fall on you. Truly God guides not one who transgresses and lies!" "O my people! Yours is the dominion this day: you have the upper hand in the land: but who will help us from the punishment of God, should it befall us?" Pharaoh said, "I but point out to you that which I see myself; nor do I guide you but to the path of right!" Then said the man who believed, "O my people! Truly I fear for you something like the day of disaster of the Confederates in sin! Something like the fate of the people of Noah, the 'Ad, and the Thamud, and those who came after them: but God never wishes injustice to His servants." "And O my people! I fear for you a day when there will be mutual calling and wailing, a day when you shall turn your backs and flee: no defender shall you have from God: any whom God leaves to stray, there is none to guide." "And to you there came Joseph in times gone by, with clear signs, but you ceased not to doubt of the mission for which he had come: at length, when he died, you said: 'No messenger will God send after him.' Thus does God leave to stray such as transgress and live in doubt." "Those who dispute about the signs of God, without any authority that has reached them, grievous and odious is such conduct in the sight of God and of the believers. Thus does God seal up every heart of arrogant and obstinate transgressors." Pharaoh said, "O Haman! Build me a lofty palace, that I may attain the ways and means of reaching the heavens, and that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned, I think Moses is a liar!" Thus was made alluring, in Pharaoh's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the path; and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but perdition for him. The man who believed said further, "O my people! Follow me: I will lead you to the path of right. This life of the present is nothing but temporary convenience: it is the hereafter that is the home that will last. He that works evil will not be requited but by the like thereof: and he that works a righteous deed, whether man or woman, and is a believer, such will enter the garden of bliss: therein will they have abundance without measure.""Whoever does an evil, he shall not be recompensed but the like of it, and whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, these shall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure. And O my people! How strange it is for me to call you to salvation while you call me to the fire! You call upon me to blaspheme against God and to join with Him partners of whom I have no knowledge; and I call you to the Exalted in Power, Who forgives again and again! Without doubt, you call me to one who is not fit to be called to, whether in this world or in the Hereafter; our return will be to God, and the transgressors will be companions of the fire! Soon you will remember what I say to you now. My affair I commit to God: for God watches over His servants. Then God saved him from every ill that they plotted against him, but the penalty encompassed the people of Pharaoh. In front of the fire will they be brought, morning and evening: and on the day that judgment will be established: 'Cast the people of Pharaoh into the severest penalty!' Behold, they will dispute with each other in the fire! The weak ones will say to those who had been arrogant, 'We but followed you: can you then take from us some share of the fire?' Those who had been arrogant will say: 'We are all in this fire! Truly, God has judged between His servants!' Those in the fire will say to the keepers of hell: 'Pray to your Lord to lighten us the penalty for a day at least!' They will say: 'Did there not come to you your messengers with clear signs?' They will say, 'Yes.' They will reply, 'Then pray as you like! But the prayer of those without faith is nothing but futile wandering in mazes of error!' We will, without doubt, help our messengers and those who believe, both in this world's life and on the day when the witnesses will stand forth. The day when no profit will it be to wrong-doers to present their excuses, but they will only have the curse and the home of misery. We did aforetime give Moses the book of guidance, and we gave the book in inheritance to the children of Israel, a guide and a message to men of understanding. Patiently, then, persevere: for the promise of God is true: and ask forgiveness for your fault, and celebrate the praises of your Lord in the evening and in the morning. Those who dispute about the signs of God without any authority bestowed on them, there is nothing in their breasts but the quest of greatness, which they shall never attain to: seek refuge, then, in God: it is He who hears and sees all things. Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater matter than the creation of men: yet most men understand not. Not equal are the blind and those who clearly see: nor are equal those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and those who do evil. Little do you learn by admonition! The hour will certainly come: therein is no doubt: yet most men believe not. And your Lord says: 'Call on Me; I will answer your prayer: but those who are too arrogant to serve Me will surely find themselves in hell - in humiliation!' It is God who has made the night for you, that you may rest therein, and the day as that which helps you to see. Verily God is full of grace and bounty to men: yet most men give no thanks. Such is God, your Lord, the creator of all things, there is no god but He: then how are you deluded away from the truth! Thus are deluded those who are wont to reject the signs of God. It is God who has made for you the earth as a resting place, and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes beautiful, and has provided for you sustenance of things pure and good; such is God your Lord. So glory to God, the Lord of the worlds!"He is the Living One. There is no god but He: Call upon Him, giving Him sincere devotion. Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds! Say: "I have been forbidden to invoke those whom you invoke besides God, seeing that the Clear Signs have come to me from my Lord; and I have been commanded to bow to the Lord of the Worlds." It is He Who has created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a leech-like clot; then He brings you forth as a child, then lets you grow and reach your age of full strength; then lets you become old, though some of you die before; and lets you reach an appointed term, in order that you may learn wisdom. It is He Who gives Life and Death; and when He decides upon an affair, He says to it, "Be," and it is. Do you not see those who dispute concerning the Signs of God? How are they turned away? Those who reject the Book and the revelations with which We sent our messengers will soon know. When the yokes are around their necks and the chains, they shall be dragged along in the boiling fetid fluid, then in the Fire shall they be burned. Then it will be said to them: "Where are the deities to which you gave part-worship?" They will reply: "They have left us in the lurch: Nay, we invoked not, of old, anything that had real existence." Thus does God leave the Unbelievers to stray. "That was because you were wont to rejoice on the earth in things other than the Truth, and that you were wont to be insolent." "Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: and evil is this abode of the arrogant!" So persevere in patience; for the Promise of God is true: and whether We show you some part of what We promise them, or We take your soul before that, it is to Us that they shall all return. We did aforetime send messengers before you: of them, there are some whose story We have related to you, and some whose story We have not related to you. It was not possible for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of God: but when the Command of God issued, the matter was decided in truth and justice, and there perished those who stood on Falsehoods. It is God Who made cattle for you, that you may use some for riding and some for food; and there are other advantages in them for you besides; that you may through them attain to any need in your hearts; and on them and on ships you are carried. And He shows you His Signs: then which of the Signs of God will you deny? Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and in the traces they have left in the land: Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them. For when their messengers came to them with Clear Signs, they exulted in such knowledge and skill as they had; but that very Wrath at which they were wont to scoff hemmed them in. But when they saw Our Punishment, they said: "We believe in God, the one God, and we reject the partners we used to join with Him." But their professing the Faith when they saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them. This has been God's Way of dealing with His Servants from the most ancient times. And even thus did the Rejecters of God perish utterly!"Say: 'I am but a man like you: It is revealed to me by inspiration that your God is one God: so stand true to Him and ask for His forgiveness.' And woe to those who join gods with God, those who do not give charity and deny the Hereafter. For those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, there is a reward that will never fail. Say: 'Is it that you deny Him who created the earth in two days? And do you join equals with Him? He is the Lord of all the Worlds.' He set on the earth, mountains standing firm, high above it, and bestowed blessings on the earth, and measured therein all things to give them nourishment in due proportion, in four days, in accordance with the needs of those who seek sustenance. Moreover, He comprehended in His design the sky, and it had been as smoke: He said to it and to the earth: 'Come together, willingly or unwillingly.' They said: 'We come together, in willing obedience.' So He completed them as seven firmaments in two days, and He assigned to each heaven its duty and command. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights and provided it with guard. Such is the decree of the Exalted in Might, Full of Knowledge. But if they turn away, say: 'I have warned you of a stunning punishment like that which overtook the 'Ad and the Thamud!' Behold, the messengers came to them, from before them and behind them, preaching: 'Serve none but God.' They said, 'If our Lord had so pleased, He would certainly have sent down angels to preach. Now we reject your mission altogether.' The 'Ad behaved arrogantly through the land, against all truth and reason, and said: 'Who is superior to us in strength?' Did they not see that God, who created them, was superior to them in strength? But they continued to reject Our signs. So We sent against them a furious wind through days of disaster, that We might give them a taste of a penalty of humiliation in this life; but the penalty of the Hereafter will be more humiliating still, and they will find no help. As to the Thamud, We gave them guidance, but they preferred blindness of heart to guidance: so the stunning punishment of humiliation seized them because of what they had earned. But We delivered those who believed and practiced righteousness. On the day that the enemies of God will be gathered together to the Fire, they will be marched in ranks. At length, when they reach the Fire, their hearing, their sight, and their skins will bear witness against them as to all their deeds. They will say to their skins: 'Why bear witness against us?' They will say: 'God has given us speech, who gives speech to everything: He created you for the first time, and unto Him were you to return.' You did not seek to hide yourselves, lest your hearing, your sight, and your skins should bear witness against you! But you thought that God knew not many of the things that you used to do! But this thought of yours which you did entertain concerning your Lord has brought you to destruction, and now you have become of those utterly lost! If they have patience, the Fire will be a home for them! And if they beg to be received into favor, into favor will they not be received. We have destined for them intimate companions who made alluring to them what was before them and behind them; and the sentence among the previous generations of jinns and men, who have passed away, is proved against them; for they are utterly lost. The unbelievers say: 'Listen not to this Qur'an, but talk at random in the midst of its reading, that you may gain the upper hand.'"Those who disbelieve say: "Do not listen to this Qur'an and make noise therein, perhaps you may overcome." But We will certainly give the Unbelievers a taste of a severe penalty, and We will requite them for the worst of their deeds. Such is the requital of the enemies of God—the Fire: therein will be their Eternal Home, a fitting reward for rejecting Our Signs. The Unbelievers will say: "Our Lord! Show us those, among jinns and men, who misled us: We shall crush them beneath our feet, so they become the vilest." In the case of those who say, "Our Lord is God," and stand steadfast, the angels descend on them, saying: "Fear not! Nor grieve! Receive the Glad Tidings of the Garden (of Bliss) which you were promised! We are your protectors in this life and in the Hereafter: therein you shall have all that your souls desire; therein you shall have all that you ask for—a hospitable gift from One Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!" Who is better in speech than one who calls to God, works righteousness, and says, "I am of those who bow in Islam"? Nor can goodness and evil be equal. Repel evil with what is better: then he between whom and you was hatred will become as if he were your friend and intimate. And no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint—none but persons of the greatest good fortune. If an incitement to discord is made to you by the Evil One, seek refuge in God. He is the One Who hears and knows all things. Among His Signs are the Night and the Day, and the Sun and the Moon. Do not prostrate to the sun and the moon, but prostrate to God, Who created them, if it is Him you wish to serve. If they (Unbelievers) are arrogant, those who celebrate His praises by night and by day are in the presence of your Lord and never tire. Among His Signs is this: you see the earth barren and desolate; but when We send down rain to it, it is stirred to life and yields increase. Truly, He Who gives life to the dead earth can surely give life to men who are dead. For He has power over all things. Those who pervert the Truth in Our Signs are not hidden from Us. Which is better—he that is cast into the Fire, or he that comes safe through on the Day of Judgment? Do what you will: verily He sees all that you do. Those who reject the Message when it comes to them are not hidden from Us. It is a Book of exalted power. No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it: It is sent down by One Full of Wisdom, Worthy of all Praise. Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you: your Lord has at His Command all forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty. Had We sent this as a Qur'an in a language other than Arabic, they would have said: "Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! A Book not in Arabic and a Messenger an Arab?" Say: "It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their eyes: They are being called from a place far distant!" We certainly gave Moses the Book aforetime, but disputes arose therein. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, their differences would have been settled between them: but they remained in suspicious disquieting doubt thereon. Whoever works righteousness benefits his own soul; whoever works evil, it is against his own soul: nor is your Lord ever unjust to His Servants. To Him is referred the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment): He knows all. 
-doers of this generation- the evil results of their deeds will soon overtake them, and they will never be able to frustrate Our Plan! But the evils that they earned smote them; and such of these as do wrong, the evils that they earn will smite them; they cannot escape. Know they not that God enlarges the provision or restricts it, for any He pleases? Verily, in this are Signs for those who believe! Say: "O my Servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of God: for God forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." Turn to your Lord in repentance and bow to His Will, before the Penalty comes on you: after that, you shall not be helped. And follow the best of the courses revealed to you from your Lord, before the Penalty comes on you suddenly while you perceive not! Lest the soul should then say: 'Ah! Woe is me! In that I neglected my duty towards God, and was among those who mocked!' Or it should say: 'If only God had guided me, I should certainly have been among the righteous!' Or it should say when it actually sees the penalty: 'If only I had another chance, I should certainly be among those who do good!' The reply will be: 'Nay, but there came to you My Signs, and you did reject them: you were haughty and became one of those who reject faith!' On the Day of Judgment, you will see those who told lies against God; their faces will be turned black. Is there not in Hell an abode for the haughty? But God will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation: no evil shall touch them, nor shall they grieve. God is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all affairs. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: and those who reject the Signs of God, it is they who will be in loss. Say: "Is it someone other than God that you order me to worship, O ignorant ones?" But it has already been revealed to you, as it was to those before you: "If you were to join gods with God, truly fruitless will be your work in life, and you will surely be in the ranks of those who lose all spiritual good." Nay, but worship God, and be of those who give thanks. No just estimate have they made of God, such as is due to Him: On the Day of Judgment, the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the heavens will be rolled up in His right hand. Glory to Him! High is He above the partners they attribute to Him! The Trumpet will be sounded, when all that are in the heavens and on earth will swoon, except such as it will please God to exempt. Then a second one will be sounded, when, behold, they will be standing and looking on! And the Earth will shine with the Glory of its Lord: the Record of Deeds will be placed open; the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward, and a just decision pronounced between them; and they will not be wronged in the least. And to every soul will be paid in full the fruit of its deeds; and God knows best all that they do. The Unbelievers will be led to Hell in crowds: until, when they arrive there, its gates will be opened. And its keepers will say, "Did not messengers come to you from among yourselves, rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of This Day of yours?" The answer will be: "True: but the Decree of Punishment has been proved true against the Unbelievers!" To them will be said: "Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: and evil is this Abode of the Arrogant!" And those who feared their Lord will be led to the Garden in crowds: until, behold, they arrive there; its gates will be opened; and its keepers will say: "Peace be upon you! Well have you done! Enter here, to dwell therein."

"Garden in companies; until when they come to it, and its doors shall be opened, and the keepers of it shall say to them: Peace be on you, you shall be happy; therefore enter it to abide. 039.074 Y: They will say: 'Praise be to God, Who has truly fulfilled His Promise to us, and has given us (this) land in heritage: We can dwell in the Garden as we will: how excellent a reward for those who work (righteousness)!' P: They say: Praise be to God, Who hath fulfilled His promise unto us and hath made us inherit the land, sojourning in the Garden where we will! So bounteous is the wage of workers. S: And they shall say: (All) praise is due to God, Who has made good to us His promise, and He has made us inherit the land; we may abide in the garden where we please; so goodly is the reward of the workers. 039.075 Y: And thou wilt see the angels surrounding the Throne (Divine) on all sides, singing Glory and Praise to their Lord. The Decision between them (at Judgment) will be in (perfect) justice, and the cry (on all sides) will be, 'Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds!' P: And thou (O Muhammad) seest the angels thronging round the Throne, hymning the praises of their Lord. And they are judged aright. And it is said: Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds! S: And you shall see the angels going round about the throne glorifying the praise of their Lord; and judgment shall be given between them with justice, and it shall be said: All praise is due to God, the Lord of the worlds.

And how (terrible) was My Requital!

(on that day) those who disbelieve are informed by proclamation: Verily God's abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one of another, when ye were called unto the faith but did refuse.

040.011 Y: They will say: 'Our Lord! twice hast Thou made us without life, and twice hast Thou given us Life! Now have we recognised our sins: Is there any way out (of this)?' P: They say: Our Lord!

But the command belongeth only to God, the Sublime, the Majestic. S: That is because when God alone was called upon, you disbelieved, and when associates were given to Him, you believed; so judgment belongs to God, the High, the Great.

S: This day every soul shall be rewarded for what it has earned; no injustice (shall be done) this day; surely God is quick in reckoning.
040.018 Y: Warn them of the Day that is (ever) drawing near, when the hearts will (come) right up to the throats to choke (them); No intimate friend nor intercessor will the wrong-doers have, who could be listened to. P: Warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of the approaching (doom), when the hearts will be choking the throats, (when) there will be no friend for the wrong-doers, nor any intercessor who will be heard. S: And warn them of the day that draws near, when hearts shall rise up to the throats, grieving inwardly; the unjust shall not have any compassionate friend nor any intercessor who should be obeyed.
040.019 Y: (God) knows of (the tricks) that deceive with the eyes, and all that the hearts (of men) conceal. P: He knoweth the traitor of the eyes, and that which the bosoms conceal.To Him is referred all knowledge of the Hour. No fruits burst forth from their sheaths, and no female carries or brings forth but with His knowledge. On the day when He calls to them, "Where are My partners?" they will say, "We confess to You, none of us is a witness for them." The deities they used to invoke will leave them, and they will perceive they have no way of escape. Man does not tire of asking for good things, but if ill touches him, he gives up all hope and is lost in despair. When We give him a taste of some mercy from Ourselves after adversity, he says, "This is due to my merit. I think not that the Hour will ever be established; but if I am brought back to my Lord, I have much good in His sight!" But We will show the Unbelievers the truth of all they did, and We shall give them a taste of a severe penalty. When We bestow favors on man, he turns away, but when evil seizes him, he comes full of prolonged prayer. Say: "See if the Revelation is from God, and yet you reject it? Who is more astray than one who is in a schism far from any purpose?" Soon We will show them Our Signs in the furthest regions and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord witnesses all things? Are they in doubt concerning the Meeting with their Lord? Indeed, He encompasses all things.

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
Ha-Mim. 'Ain. Sin. Qaf. Thus does He send inspiration to you as He did to those before you—God, Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: He is Most High, Most Great. The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them by His Glory, and the angels celebrate the praises of their Lord and pray for forgiveness for all beings on earth. Verily, God is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Those who take protectors besides Him—God watches over them, and you are not the disposer of their affairs. Thus have We sent by inspiration to you an Arabic Qur'an, that you may warn the Mother of Cities and all around her, and warn them of the Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt: some will be in the Garden, and some in the Blazing Fire. If God had so willed, He could have made them a single people, but He admits whom He will to His Mercy; and the wrongdoers will have no protector nor helper. What! Have they taken protectors besides Him? But it is God—He is the Protector, and He gives life to the dead: He has power over all things. Whatever you differ in, the decision thereof is with God: such is God my Lord. In Him I trust, and to Him I turn. He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you. There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees all things. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges and restricts sustenance to whom He will, for He knows all things. The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah, and that which We have sent by inspiration to you, and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that you should remain steadfast in religion and make no divisions therein. To those who worship other things than God, hard is the way to which you call them. God chooses to Himself those whom He pleases and guides to Himself those who turn to Him.He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him), frequently. And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them, through selfish envy among themselves. Had it not been for a Word from your Lord, the matter would have been settled between them. Those who inherited the Book after them are in suspicious doubt concerning it. Now then, call them to the Faith, and stand steadfast as you are commanded, nor follow their vain desires; but say: "I believe in the Book which God has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justly between you. God is our Lord and your Lord: for us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. God will bring us together, and to Him is our Final Goal." But those who dispute concerning God after He has been accepted, their dispute is futile in the Sight of their Lord: on them will be a terrible penalty. It is God Who has sent down the Book in Truth, and the Balance (by which to weigh conduct). And what will make you realize that perhaps the Hour is close at hand? Only those who do not believe in it wish to hasten it: those who believe hold it in awe, and know that it is the Truth. Behold, those that dispute concerning the Hour are far astray. Gracious is God to His servants: He gives sustenance to whom He pleases, and He has power and can carry out His Will. To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter, We give increase in his tilth, and to any that desires the tilth of this world, We grant somewhat thereof, but he has no share in the Hereafter. What! Have they partners who have established for them some religion without the permission of God? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment, the matter would have been decided between them. But the wrongdoers will have a grievous penalty. You will see the wrongdoers in fear on account of what they have earned, and that must fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens: they shall have, before their Lord, all that they wish for. That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty of God. That is the Bounty whereof God gives glad tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin." And if anyone earns any good, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate service. What! Do they say, "He has forged a falsehood against God"? But if God willed, He could seal up your heart. And God blots out vanity, and proves the Truth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts. He is the One that accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins: and He knows all that you do. And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers, there is a terrible penalty. If God were to enlarge the provision for His servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but He sends it down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His servants well-acquainted, watchful. He is the One that sends down rain even after men have given up all hope, and scatters His Mercy far and wide. And He is the Protector, Worthy of all Praise. And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gather them together when He wills. Whatever misfortune happens to you is because of the things your hands have wrought, and for many of them, He grants forgiveness.Nor can you escape through the earth; nor have you, besides God, anyone to protect or to help. Among His Signs are the ships, smooth-running through the ocean, tall as mountains. If it be His Will, He can still the wind, making them motionless on the ocean's surface. In this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful. He can also cause them to perish because of the evil they have earned, but He forgives much. Those who dispute about Our Signs have no way of escape. Whatever you are given here is but a convenience of this life, but what is with God is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord. Those who avoid greater crimes and shameful deeds, and forgive when they are angry, hearken to their Lord, establish regular prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and spend out of what We bestow on them for sustenance. Those who, when wronged, defend themselves, and those who forgive and make reconciliation, their reward is due from God. If any help and defend themselves after a wrong done to them, there is no cause of blame. The blame is only against those who oppress men and transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice. For such, there will be a grievous penalty. If any show patience and forgive, that is an exercise of courageous will and resolution. For any whom God leaves astray, there is no protector thereafter. You will see the wrongdoers, when in sight of the penalty, saying, "Is there any way to return?" They will be brought forward to the penalty, in a humble frame of mind because of their disgrace, looking with a stealthy glance. The believers will say, "Those are indeed in loss, who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment." Truly, the wrongdoers are in a lasting penalty. They have no protectors to help them other than God. Hearken to your Lord before there comes a Day which there will be no putting back. That Day, there will be no place of refuge nor any room for denial of your sins. If they run away, We have not sent you as a guard over them. Your duty is but to convey the message. When We give man a taste of mercy from Us, he exults, but when some ill happens to him because of his deeds, he is ungrateful. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows children, male or female, according to His Will, or He bestows both males and females, and He leaves barren whom He will. He is full of Knowledge and Power. It is not fitting for a man that God should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal, with God's permission, what God wills. Thus have We, by Our Command, sent inspiration to you. You did not know what Revelation was, nor what Faith was, but We have made the Qur'an a Light, guiding whom We please of Our servants. You guide to the Straight Way, the Way of God, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Behold, all affairs tend towards God!ms hide. S: He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal.

040.020 Y: And God will judge with (justice and) Truth: but those whom (men) invoke besides Him, will not (be in a position) to judge at all. Verily it is God (alone) Who hears and sees (all things). P: God judgeth with truth, while those to whom they cry instead of Him judge not at all. Lo! God, He is the Hearer, the Seer. S: And God judges with the truth; and those whom they call upon besides Him cannot judge aught; surely God is the Hearing, the Seeing.

040.021 Y: Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were even superior to them in strength, and in the traces (they have left) in the land: but God did call them to account for their sins, and none had they to defend them against God. P: Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who disbelieved before them? They were mightier than these in power and (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. Yet God seized them for their sins, and they had no protector from God. S: Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those who were before them? Mightier than these were they in strength and in fortifications in the land, but God destroyed them for their sins; and there was not for them any defender against God.

040.022 Y: That was because there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs), but they rejected them: So God called them to account: for He is Full of Strength, Strict in Punishment. P: That was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs (of God's Sovereignty) but they disbelieved; so God seized them. Lo! He is Strong, severe in punishment. S: That was because there came to them their messengers with clear arguments, but they rejected (them), therefore God destroyed them; surely He is Strong, Severe in retribution.

040.023 Y: Of old We sent Moses, with Our Signs and an authority manifest, P: And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant S: And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and clear authority,

040.024 Y: To Pharaoh, Haman, and Qarun; but they called (him) "a sorcerer telling lies!" P: Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but they said: A lying sorcerer! S: To Firon and Haman and Qaroun, but they said: A lying magician.

040.025 Y: Now, when he came to them in Truth, from Us, they said, "Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and keep alive their females," but the plots of Unbelievers (end) in nothing but errors (and delusions)! P: And when he brought them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women. But the plot of disbelievers is in naught but error. S: So when he brought to them the truth from Us, they said: Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep their women alive; and the struggle of the unbelievers will only come to a state of perdition.

040.026 Y: Said Pharaoh: "Leave me to slay Moses; and let him call on his Lord! What I fear is lest he should change your religion, or lest he should cause mischief to appear in the land!" P: And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill Moses, and let him cry unto his Lord. Lo! I fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in the land. S: And Firon said: Let me alone that I may slay Musa and let him call upon his Lord; surely I fear that he will change your religion or that he will make mischief to appear in the land.

040.027 Y: Moses said: "I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord (for protection) from every arrogant one who believes not in the Day of Account!" P: Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning. S: And Musa said: Surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every proud one who does not believe in the day of reckoning.

040.028 Y: A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said: "Will ye slay a man because he says, 'My Lord is God'?- when he has indeed come to you with Clear (Signs) from your Lord? and if he be a liar, on him is (the sin of) his lie: but, if he is telling the Truth, then will fall on you something of the (calamity) of which he warns you: Truly God guides not one who transgresses and lies!" P: And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye kill a man because he saith: My Lord is God, and hath brought you clear proofs from your Lord? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful, then some of that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! God guideth not one who is a prodigal, a liar. S: And a believing man of Firon's people who hid his faith said: What! will you slay a man because he says: My Lord is God, and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be his lie, and if he be truthful, there will befall you some of that which he threatens you (with); surely God does not guide him who is extravagant, a liar:

040.029 Y: "O my People! Yours is the dominion this day: Ye have the upper hand in the land: but who will help us from the Punishment of God, should it befall us?" Pharaoh said: "I but point out to you that which I see (myself); Nor do I guide you but to the Path of Right!" P: O my people! Yours is the kingdom to-day, ye being uppermost in the land. But who would save us from the wrath of God should it reach us? Pharaoh said: I do but show you what I think, and I do but guide you to wise policy. S: O my people! yours is the kingdom this day, being masters in the land, but who will help us against the punishment of God if it come to us? Firon said: I do not show you aught but that which I see (myself), and I do not make you follow any but the right way.

040.030 Y: Then said the man who believed: "O my people! Truly I do fear for you something like the Day (of disaster) of the Confederates (in sin)!"- P: And he who believed said: O my people! Lo! I fear for you a fate like that of the factions (of old); S: And he who believed said: O my people! surely I fear for you the like of what befell the parties:

040.031 Y: "Something like the fate of the People of Noah, the 'Ad, and the Thamud, and those who came after them: but God never wishes injustice to his Servants." P: A plight like that of Noah's folk, and A'ad and Thamud, and those after them, and God willeth no injustice for (His) slaves. S: The like of what befell the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood and those after them, and God does not desire injustice for (His) servants;

040.032 Y: "And O my people! I fear for you a Day when there will be Mutual calling (and wailing)," - P: And, O my people! Lo! I fear for you a Day of Summoning, S: And, O my people! I fear for you the day of calling out,

040.033 Y: "A Day when ye shall turn your backs and flee: No defender shall ye have from God: Any whom God leaves to stray, there is none to guide" P: A day when ye will turn to flee, having no preserver from God: and he whom God sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. S: The day on which you will turn back retreating; there shall be no savior for you from God, and whomsoever God causes to err, there is no guide for him:

040.034 Y: "And to you there came Joseph in times gone by, with Clear Signs, but ye ceased not to doubt of the (Mission) for which he had come: At length, when he died, ye said: 'No messenger will God send after him.' thus doth God leave to stray such as transgress and live in doubt," - P: And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he brought you till, when he died, ye said: God will not send any messenger after him. Thus God deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter. S: And certainly Yusuf came to you before with clear arguments, but you ever remained in doubt as to what he brought; until when he died, you said: God will never raise a messenger after him. Thus does God cause him to err who is extravagant, a doubter,

040.035 Y: "(Such) as dispute about the Signs of God, without any authority that hath reached them, grievous and odious (is such conduct) in the sight of God and of the Believers. Thus doth God, seal up every heart - of arrogant and obstinate Transgressors." P: Those who wrangle concerning the revelations of God without any warrant that hath come unto them, it is greatly hateful in the sight of God and in the sight of those who believe. Thus doth God print on every arrogant, disdainful heart. S: Those who dispute concerning the communications of God without any authority that He has given them; greatly hated is it by God and by those who believe. Thus does God set a seal over the heart of every proud, haughty one.

040.036 Y: Pharaoh said: "O Haman! Build me a lofty palace, that I may attain the ways and means-" P: And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me a tower that haply I may reach the roads, S: And Firon said: O Haman! build for me a tower that I may attain the means of access,

040.037 Y: "The ways and means of (reaching) the heavens, and that I may mount up to the god of Moses: But as far as I am concerned, I think (Moses) is a liar!" Thus was made alluring, in Pharaoh's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the Path; and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but perdition (for him). P: The roads of the heavens, and may look upon the god of Moses, though verily I think him a liar. Thus was the evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh, and he was debarred from the (right) way. The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin. S: The means of access to the heavens, then reach the god of Musa, and I surely think him to be a liar. And thus the evil of his deed was made fairseeming to Firon, and he was turned away from the way; and the struggle of Firon was not (to end) in aught but destruction.

040.038 Y: The man who believed said further: "O my people! Follow me: I will lead you to the Path of Right." P: And he who believed said: O my people! Follow me. I will show you the way of right conduct. S: And he who believed said: O my people! follow me, I will guide you to the right course;

040.039 Y: "O my people! This life of the present is nothing but (temporary) convenience: It is the Hereafter that is the Home that will last." P: O my people! Lo! this life of the world is but a passing comfort, and lo! the Hereafter, that is the enduring home. S: O my people! this life of the world is only a (passing) enjoyment, and surely the hereafter is the abode to settle;

040.040 Y: "He that works evil will not be requited but by the like thereof: and he that works a righteous deed - whether man or woman - and is a Believer- such will enter the Garden (of Bliss): Therein will they have abundance without measure." P: Whoso doeth an ill-deed, he will be repaid the like thereof, while whoso doeth rig"Whoever does an evil deed will be repaid with the like of it, and whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, will enter the Garden, where they will be nourished without stint. O my people! How strange it is for me to call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire! You call upon me to blaspheme against God and to join with Him partners of whom I have no knowledge; and I call you to the Exalted in Power, Who forgives again and again! Without doubt, you call me to one who is not fit to be called to, whether in this world or in the Hereafter; our return will be to God, and the transgressors will be companions of the Fire! Soon you will remember what I say to you now. My affair I commit to God, for God watches over His servants. Then God saved him from every ill that they plotted against him, but the penalty encompassed the People of Pharaoh. In front of the Fire, they will be brought morning and evening, and on the Day that Judgment will be established: 'Cast the People of Pharaoh into the severest penalty!' They will dispute with each other in the Fire! The weak ones will say to those who had been arrogant, 'We but followed you; can you then take from us some share of the Fire?' Those who had been arrogant will say, 'We are all in this Fire! Truly, God has judged between His servants.' Those in the Fire will say to the Keepers of Hell, 'Pray to your Lord to lighten the penalty for a day at least!' They will say, 'Did your messengers not come to you with clear signs?' They will say, 'Yes.' They will reply, 'Then pray as you like, but the prayer of those without faith is futile.' We will, without doubt, help our messengers and those who believe, both in this world's life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth. The Day when no profit will it be to wrong-doers to present their excuses, but they will only have the curse and the home of misery. We did aforetime give Moses the Book of Guidance, and We gave the book in inheritance to the Children of Israel, a guide and a message to men of understanding. Patiently, then, persevere, for the promise of God is true. Ask forgiveness for your fault and celebrate the praises of your Lord in the evening and in the morning. Those who dispute about the signs of God without any authority bestowed on them have nothing in their breasts but the quest for greatness, which they shall never attain. Seek refuge in God; He hears and sees all things. Assuredly, the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater matter than the creation of men, yet most men understand not. Not equal are the blind and those who see, nor are those who believe and work deeds of righteousness equal to those who do evil. Little do you learn by admonition! The Hour will certainly come; there is no doubt about it, yet most men believe not. Your Lord says, 'Call on Me; I will answer your prayer. Those who are too arrogant to serve Me will surely find themselves in Hell, in humiliation!' It is God who has made the night for you to rest and the day to see. Verily, God is full of grace and bounty to men, yet most men give no thanks. Such is God, your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no god but He. How then are you deluded away from the truth? Thus are deluded those who reject the signs of God. It is God who has made for you the earth as a resting place and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes beautiful, and has provided for you sustenance of things pure and good. Such is God, your Lord. So glory to God, the Lord of the Worlds!"He is the Living One. There is no god but He. Call upon Him with sincere devotion. Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds! Say: "I have been forbidden to invoke those whom you invoke besides God, seeing that the Clear Signs have come to me from my Lord; and I have been commanded to bow to the Lord of the Worlds." It is He Who has created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a leech-like clot; then He brings you forth as a child, lets you grow to full strength, and then become old, though some die before reaching an appointed term, so that you may learn wisdom. It is He Who gives Life and Death; when He decides upon an affair, He says to it, "Be," and it is. Do you not see those who dispute concerning the Signs of God? How are they turned away? Those who reject the Book and the revelations sent with Our messengers will soon know. When yokes are around their necks and chains, they will be dragged through boiling water and then burned in the Fire. They will be asked, "Where are the deities you used to worship besides God?" They will reply, "They have left us; we did not invoke anything real." Thus does God leave the Unbelievers to stray. This is because you exulted in the earth without right and behaved insolently. Enter the gates of Hell to dwell therein; evil is the abode of the arrogant. So persevere in patience; the Promise of God is true. Whether We show you some part of what We promise them or take your soul before that, they will return to Us. We sent messengers before you; some whose stories We have related to you and some whose stories We have not. No messenger could bring a sign except by God's leave. When God's command comes, the matter is decided in truth and justice, and those who stood on falsehoods perish. God made cattle for you to ride and for food, and there are other advantages in them for you. He shows you His Signs; which of the Signs of God will you deny? Do they not travel through the earth and see the end of those before them? They were more numerous and stronger, yet all they accomplished was of no profit to them. When their messengers came with Clear Signs, they exulted in their knowledge, but the Wrath they scoffed at hemmed them in. When they saw Our Punishment, they said, "We believe in God and reject the partners we used to join with Him." But their faith did not profit them when they saw Our Punishment. This is God's way of dealing with His servants, and the Rejecters of God perish utterly. 

Chapter 41: FUSSILAT (EXPLAINED IN DETAIL)
In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
Ha Mim. A Revelation from God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. A Book whereof the verses are explained in detail; a Qur'an in Arabic for people who understand; giving good news and admonition.

P: Shall We utterly ignore you because ye are a wanton folk? S: What! shall We then turn away the reminder from you altogether because you are an extravagant people? 043.006 Y: But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old? P: How many a prophet did We send among the men of old! S: And how many a prophet have We sent among the ancients. 043.007 Y: And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him. P: And never came there unto them a prophet but they used to mock him. S: And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him. 043.008 Y: So We destroyed (them)- stronger in power than these;- and (thus) has passed on the Parable of the peoples of old. P: Then We destroyed men mightier than these in prowess; and the example of the men of old hath gone (before them). S: Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess, and the case of the ancients has gone before, 043.009 Y: If thou wert to question them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' They would be sure to reply, 'they were created by (Him), the Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge';- P: And if thou (Muhammad) ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer: The Mighty, the Knower created them; S: And if you should ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth? they would most certainly say: The Mighty, the Knowing One, has created them; 043.010 Y: (Yea, the same that) has made for you the earth (like a carpet) spread out, and has made for you roads (and channels) therein, in order that ye may find guidance (on the way); P: Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and placed roads for you therein, that haply ye may find your way; S: He Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and made in it ways for you that you may go aright; 043.011 Y: That sends down (from time to time) rain from the sky in due measure;- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised (from the dead);- P: And Who sendeth down water from the sky in (due) measure, and We revive a dead land therewith. Even so will ye be brought forth; S: And He Who sends down water from the cloud according to a measure, then We raise to life thereby a dead country, even thus shall you be brought forth; 043.012 Y: That has created pairs in all things, and has made for you ships and cattle on which ye ride, P: He Who created all the pairs, and appointed for you ships and cattle whereupon ye ride. S: And He Who created pairs of all things, and made for you of the ships and the cattle what you ride on, 043.013 Y: In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs, and when so seated, ye may celebrate the (kind) favour of your Lord, and say, "Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use), for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves)," P: That ye may mount upon their backs, and may remember your Lord's favour when ye mount thereon, and may say: Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto us, and we were not capable (of subduing them); S: That you may firmly sit on their backs, then remember the favor of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon, and say: Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us and we were not able to do it, 043.014 Y: "And to our Lord, surely, must we turn back!" P: And lo! unto our Lord we surely are returning. S: And surely to our Lord we must return. 043.015 Y: Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him (in his godhead)! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed! P: And they allot to Him a portion of His bondmen! Lo! man is verily a mere ingrate. S: And they assign to Him a part of His servants; man, to be sure, is clearly ungrateful. 043.016 Y: What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates, and granted to you sons for choice? P: Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created, and honoureth He you with sons? S: What! has He taken daughters to Himself of what He Himself creates and chosen you to have sons? 043.017 Y: When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (God) Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief! P: And if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the Beneficent One, his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage. S: And when one of them is given news of that of which he sets up as a likeness for the Beneficent God, his face becomes black and he is full of rage. 043.018 Y: Is then one brought up among trinkets, and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with God)? P: (Liken they then to God) that which is bred up in outward show, and in dispute cannot make itself plain? S: What! that which is made in ornaments and which in contention is unable to make plain speech! 043.019 Y: And they make into females angels who themselves serve God. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded, and they will be called to account! P: And they make the angels, who are the slaves of the Beneficent, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned. S: And they make the angels them who are the servants of the Beneficent God female (divinities). What! did they witness their creation? Their evidence shall be written down and they shall be questioned. 043.020 Y: ("Ah!") they say, "If it had been the will of (God) Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped such (deities)!" Of that they have no knowledge! they do nothing but lie! P: And they say: If the Beneficent One had (so) willed, we should not have worshipped them. They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do but guess. S: And they say: If the Beneficent God had pleased, we should never have worshipped them. They have no knowledge of this; they only lie. 043.021 Y: What! have We given them a Book before this, to which they are holding fast? P: Or have We given them any scripture before (this Qur'an) so that they are holding fast thereto? S: Or have We given them a book before it so that they hold fast to it? 043.022 Y: Nay! they say: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps." P: Nay, for they say only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are guided by their footprints. S: Nay! they say: We found our fathers on a course, and surely we are guided by their footsteps. 043.023 Y: Just in the same way, whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people, the wealthy ones among them said: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we will certainly follow in their footsteps." P: And even so We sent not a warner before thee (Muhammad) into any township but its luxurious ones said: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are following their footprints. S: And thus, We did not send before you any warner in a town, but those who led easy lives in it said: Surely we found our fathers on a course, and surely we are followers of their footsteps. 043.024 Y: He said: "What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following?" They said: "For us, we deny that ye (prophets) are sent (on a mission at all)." P: (And the warner) said: What! Even though I bring you better guidance than that ye found your fathers following? They answered: Lo! in what ye bring we are disbelievers. S: (The warner) said: What! even if I bring to you a better guide than that on which you found your fathers? They said: Surely we are unbelievers in that with which you are sent. 043.025 Y: So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected (Truth)! P: So We requited them. Then see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters! S: So We inflicted retribution on them, then see how was the end of the rejecters. 043.026 Y: Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: "I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship:" P: And when Abraham said unto his father and his folk: Lo! I am innocent of what ye worship S: And when Ibrahim said to his father and his people: Surely I am clear of what you worship, 043.027 Y: "(I worship) only Him Who made me, and He will certainly guide me." P: Save Him Who did create me, for He will surely guide me. S: Save Him Who created me, for surely He will guide me. 043.028 Y: And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him, that they may turn back (to God). P: And he made it a word enduring among his seed, that haply they might return. S: And he made it a word to continue in his posterity that they may return. 043.029 Y: Yea, I have given the good things of this life to these (men) and their fathers, until the Truth has come to them, and a messenger making things clear. P: Nay, but I let these and their fathers enjoy life (only) till there should come unto them the Truth and a messenger making plain. S: Nay! I gave them and their fathers to enjoy until there came to them the truth and a Messenger making manifest (the truth). 043.030 Y: But when the Truth came to them, they said: "This is sorcery, and we do reject it." P: And now that the Truth hath come unto them they say: This is mere magic, and lo! we are disbelievers therein. S: And when there came to them the truth they said: This is magic, and surely we are disbelievers in it. 043.031 Y: Also, they say: "Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities?" P: And they say: If only this Qur'an had been revealed to some great man of the two towns? S: And they say: Why was not this Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns? 043.032 Y: Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks, so that some may command work from others. But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the (wealth) which they amass. P: Is itThey say: "Our hearts are under coverings from that to which you call us, and there is a heaviness in our ears, and a veil hangs between us and you, so work, we too are working." Say: "I am but a man like you: It is revealed to me by inspiration, that your God is one God: so stand true to Him, and ask for His forgiveness." And woe to those who join gods with God, who do not give charity and deny the Hereafter. For those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, there is a reward that will never fail. Say: "Do you deny Him Who created the earth in two Days? And do you join equals with Him? He is the Lord of all the Worlds." He set on the earth, mountains standing firm, high above it, and bestowed blessings on the earth, and measured therein all things to give them nourishment in due proportion, in four Days, in accordance with the needs of those who seek sustenance. Moreover, He comprehended in His design the sky, and it had been as smoke: He said to it and to the earth: "Come together, willingly or unwillingly." They said: "We come in willing obedience." So He completed them as seven firmaments in two Days, and assigned to each heaven its duty and command. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights and provided it with guard. Such is the Decree of the Exalted in Might, Full of Knowledge. But if they turn away, say: "I have warned you of a stunning punishment like that which overtook the 'Ad and the Thamud!" Behold, the messengers came to them, from before them and behind them, preaching: "Serve none but God." They said, "If our Lord had so pleased, He would certainly have sent down angels to preach. Now we reject your mission altogether." The 'Ad behaved arrogantly through the land, against all truth and reason, and said: "Who is superior to us in strength?" Did they not see that God, Who created them, was superior to them in strength? But they continued to reject Our Signs. So We sent against them a furious wind through days of disaster, that We might give them a taste of a penalty of humiliation in this life; but the penalty of the Hereafter will be more humiliating still, and they will find no help. As to the Thamud, We gave them guidance, but they preferred blindness of heart to guidance, so the stunning punishment of humiliation seized them because of what they had earned. But We delivered those who believed and practiced righteousness. On the Day that the enemies of God will be gathered together to the Fire, they will be marched in ranks. At length, when they reach the Fire, their hearing, their sight, and their skins will bear witness against them as to all their deeds. They will say to their skins: "Why bear witness against us?" They will say: "God has given us speech, Who gives speech to everything: He created you for the first time, and unto Him you were to return." You did not seek to hide yourselves, lest your hearing, your sight, and your skins should bear witness against you! But you thought that God knew not many of the things that you used to do! This thought of yours which you entertained concerning your Lord has brought you to destruction, and now you have become of those utterly lost! If they have patience, the Fire will be a home for them! And if they beg to be received into favor, they will not be received. We have destined for them intimate companions who made alluring to them what was before them and behind them; and the sentence among the previous generations of jinns and men, who have passed away, is proved against them; for they are utterly lost. The Unbelievers say: "Listen not to this Qur'an, but talk at random in the midst of its reading, that you may gain the upper hand.""they who apportion thy Lord's mercy? We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in rank that some of them may take labor from others; and the mercy of thy Lord is better than (the wealth) that they amass. Will they distribute the mercy of your Lord? We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world, and We have exalted some of them above others in degrees, that some of them may take others in subjection; and the mercy of your Lord is better than what they amass.

And were it not that (all) men might become of one (evil) way of life, We would provide, for everyone that blasphemes against (God) Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses and (silver) stairways on which to go up, and (silver) doors to their houses, and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline, and also adornments of gold. But all this were nothing but conveniences of the present life: The Hereafter, in the sight of thy Lord, is for the Righteous.

If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of (God) Most Gracious, We appoint for him an evil one, to be an intimate companion to him. Such (evil ones) really hinder them from the Path, but they think that they are being guided aright! At length, when (such a one) comes to Us, he says (to his evil companion): "Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!" Ah! evil is the companion (indeed)! When ye have done wrong, it will avail you nothing, that Day, that ye shall be partners in Punishment!

Canst thou then make the deaf to hear, or give direction to the blind or to such as (wander) in manifest error? Even if We take thee away, We shall be sure to exact retribution from them, or We shall show thee that (accomplished) which We have promised them: for verily We shall prevail over them. So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee; verily thou art on a Straight Way. The (Qur'an) is indeed the message, for thee and for thy people; and soon shall ye (all) be brought to account.

And question thou our messengers whom We sent before thee; did We appoint any deities other than (God) Most Gracious, to be worshipped? We did send Moses aforetime, with Our Signs, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: He said, "I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds." But when he came to them with Our Signs, behold they ridiculed them. We showed them Sign after Sign, each greater than its fellow, and We seized them with Punishment, in order that they might turn (to Us).

And they said, "O thou sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord for us according to His covenant with thee; for we shall truly accept guidance." But when We removed the Penalty from them, behold, they broke their word. And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying: "O my people! Does not the dominion of Egypt belong to me, (witness) these streams flowing underneath my (palace)? What! see ye not then? Am I not better than this (Moses), who is a contemptible wretch and can scarcely express himself clearly? Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him, or (why) come (not) with him angels accompanying him in procession?"

Thus did he make fools of his people, and they obeyed him: truly were they a people rebellious (against God). When at length they provoked Us, We exacted retribution from them, and We drowned them all. And We made them (a people) of the Past and an Example to later ages.

When (Jesus) the son of Mary is held up as an example, behold, thy people raise a clamor thereat (in ridicule)! And they say, "Are our gods best, or he?" This they set forth to thee, only by way of disputation: yea, they are a contentious people. He was no more than a servant: We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel. And if it were Our Will, We could make angels from amongst you, succeeding each other on the earth.

And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour), but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way. Let not the Evil One hinder you: for he is to you an enemy avowed.""Those who disbelieve say: Do not listen to this Quran and make noise therein, perhaps you may overcome. But We will certainly give the Unbelievers a taste of a severe penalty, and We will requite them for the worst of their deeds. Such is the requital of the enemies of God—the Fire: therein will be for them the Eternal Home, a fit requital for rejecting Our Signs. And the Unbelievers will say: 'Our Lord! Show us those, among jinns and men, who misled us: We shall crush them beneath our feet, so that they become the vilest.' In the case of those who say, 'Our Lord is God,' and stand straight and steadfast, the angels descend on them, saying: 'Fear not! Nor grieve! but receive the Glad Tidings of the Garden (of Bliss), which you were promised! We are your protectors in this life and in the Hereafter: therein shall you have all that your souls desire; therein shall you have all that you ask for—a hospitable gift from One Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!' Who is better in speech than one who calls to God, works righteousness, and says, 'I am of those who bow in Islam'? Nor can goodness and evil be equal. Repel evil with what is better: then will he between whom and you was hatred become as it were your friend and intimate! And no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint—none but persons of the greatest good fortune. And if an incitement to discord is made to you by the Evil One, seek refuge in God. He is the One Who hears and knows all things. Among His Signs are the Night and the Day, and the Sun and the Moon. Do not prostrate to the sun and the moon, but prostrate to God, Who created them, if it is Him you wish to serve. But if they are arrogant, those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and they never tire. And among His Signs is this: you see the earth barren and desolate; but when We send down rain to it, it is stirred to life and yields increase. Truly, He Who gives life to the dead earth can surely give life to those who are dead. For He has power over all things. Those who pervert the Truth in Our Signs are not hidden from Us. Which is better—he that is cast into the Fire, or he that comes safe through on the Day of Judgment? Do what you will: verily He sees all that you do. Those who reject the Message when it comes to them are not hidden from Us. And indeed it is a Book of exalted power. No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it: It is sent down by One Full of Wisdom, Worthy of all Praise. Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you: your Lord has at His Command all forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty. Had We sent this as a Qur'an in a language other than Arabic, they would have said: 'Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! A Book not in Arabic and a Messenger an Arab?' Say: 'It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their eyes: They are being called from a place far distant!' We certainly gave Moses the Book aforetime, but disputes arose therein. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, their differences would have been settled between them, but they remained in suspicious disquieting doubt thereon. Whoever works righteousness benefits his own soul; whoever works evil, it is against his own soul: nor is your Lord ever unjust to His Servants. To Him is referred the Knowledge of the Hour of Judgment: He knows all. No date-fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive within her.""Let not Satan turn you aside. He is an open enemy for you. When Jesus came with clear signs, he said: 'Now I have come to you with wisdom, and to make clear to you some of the points on which you dispute: therefore fear God and obey me.' When Jesus came with clear proofs of God's sovereignty, he said: 'I have come to you with wisdom, and to make plain some of that concerning which you differ. So keep your duty to God, and obey me.' And when Jesus came with clear arguments, he said: 'I have come to you indeed with wisdom, and that I may make clear to you part of what you differ in; so be careful of your duty to God and obey me.'

'For God, He is my Lord and your Lord: so worship Him: this is a straight way.' But sects from among themselves fell into disagreement: then woe to the wrong-doers, from the penalty of a grievous day! Do they only wait for the Hour - that it should come on them all of a sudden, while they perceive not? Friends on that day will be foes, one to another, except the righteous. My devotees! No fear shall be on you that day, nor shall you grieve. Those who have believed in Our signs and bowed their wills to Ours in Islam. Enter the Garden, you and your wives, in beauty and rejoicing. To them will be passed round, dishes and goblets of gold: there will be all that the souls could desire, all that their eyes could delight in: and you shall abide therein forever.

Such will be the Garden of which you are made heirs for your good deeds in life. You shall have therein abundance of fruit, from which you shall have satisfaction. The sinners will be in the punishment of Hell, to dwell therein forever. The punishment will not be lightened for them, and in despair will they be there overwhelmed. We wronged them not, but they it was who did the wrong. They will cry: 'O Malik! Would that your Lord put an end to us!' He will say, 'Nay, but you shall abide!' Verily We have brought the Truth to you: but most of you have a hatred for Truth. What! Have they settled some plan among themselves? But it is We who settle things. Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels? Indeed, We do, and Our messengers are by them, to record.

Say: 'If God Most Gracious had a son, I would be the first to worship.' Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne of Authority! He is free from the things they attribute to Him! So leave them to babble and play with vanities until they meet that Day of theirs, which they have been promised. It is He Who is God in heaven and God on earth; and He is full of wisdom and knowledge. And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all between them: with Him is the knowledge of the Hour of Judgment: and to Him shall you be brought back. And those whom they invoke besides God have no power of intercession; only he who bears witness to the Truth, and they know him.

If you ask them, who created them, they will certainly say, God: How then are they deluded away from the Truth? God has knowledge of the Prophet's cry, 'O my Lord! Truly these are people who will not believe!' But turn away from them, and say 'Peace!' But soon shall they know."To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No fruits burst forth from their sheaths, and no female carries or brings forth but with His knowledge. On the day when He calls unto them: "Where are My partners?" they will say: "We confess unto Thee, not one of us is a witness for them." The deities they used to invoke aforetime will leave them, and they will perceive they have no way of escape. Man does not weary of asking for good things, but if ill touches him, he gives up all hope and is lost in despair. When we give him a taste of some Mercy from Ourselves, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say, "This is due to my merit: I think not that the Hour will ever be established; but if I am brought back to my Lord, I have much good stored in His sight!" But We will show the Unbelievers the truth of all that they did, and We shall give them the taste of a severe Penalty. When We bestow favors on man, he turns away, and gets himself remote on his side; and when evil seizes him, he comes full of prolonged prayer! Say: "See if the Revelation is really from God, and yet you reject it? Who is more astray than one who is in a schism far from any purpose?" Soon will We show them our Signs in the furthest regions of the earth, and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord witnesses all things? Are they in doubt concerning the Meeting with their Lord? Indeed, He encompasses all things! 

Chapter 42: ASH-SHURA (COUNCIL, CONSULTATION)
Total Verses: 53
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
Ha-Mim. 'Ain. Sin. Qaf. Thus does God, Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom, send inspiration to you as He did to those before you. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: and He is Most High, Most Great. The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them by His Glory: and the angels celebrate the Praises of their Lord, and pray for forgiveness for all beings on earth: Verily God is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Those who take as protectors others besides Him, God watches over them; and you are not the disposer of their affairs. Thus have We sent by inspiration to you an Arabic Qur'an: that you may warn the Mother of Cities and all around her, and warn them of the Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt: some will be in the Garden, and some in the Blazing Fire. If God had so willed, He could have made them a single people; but He admits whom He will to His Mercy; and the wrongdoers will have no protector nor helper. What! Have they taken for worship protectors besides Him? But it is God, He is the Protector, and He gives life to the dead: He has power over all things. Whatever it be wherein you differ, the decision thereof is with God: such is God my Lord: In Him I trust, and to Him I turn. He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees all things. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges and restricts the Sustenance to whom He will: for He knows full well all things. The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah, and that which We have sent by inspiration to you, and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that you should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than God, hard is the way to which you call them. God chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn to Him."Our Lord! Remove the penalty from us, for we truly believe!" They will say: "Our Lord, relieve us of the torment. We are believers." How can there be remembrance for them when a messenger making plain the truth had already come to them? Yet they turn away from him and say: "Tutored by others, a man possessed!" We shall indeed remove the penalty for a while, but truly they will revert to their ways. One day We shall seize you with a mighty onslaught and exact retribution! We did, before them, try the people of Pharaoh: there came to them a messenger most honorable, saying: "Restore to me the servants of God. I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust. And be not arrogant against God, for I come to you with clear authority. I have sought safety with my Lord and your Lord against your injuring me. If you believe me not, at least keep yourselves away from me." But they were aggressive, then he cried to his Lord: "These are indeed a people given to sin." The reply came: "March forth with My servants by night, for you are sure to be pursued. Leave the sea as a furrow divided, for they are a host destined to be drowned." How many were the gardens and springs they left behind, and cornfields and noble buildings, and wealth wherein they had taken such delight! Thus was their end, and We made other people inherit those things. Neither heaven nor earth shed a tear over them, nor were they given a respite. We did deliver aforetime the Children of Israel from humiliating punishment inflicted by Pharaoh, for he was arrogant among inordinate transgressors. We chose them aforetime above the nations, knowingly, and granted them signs in which there was a manifest trial. As to these (Quraish), they say: "There is nothing beyond our first death, and we shall not be raised again. Then bring back our forefathers if what you say is true!" Are they better than the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them because they were guilty of sin. We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, merely in idle sport. We created them not except for just ends, but most of them do not understand. Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them, the day when no protector can avail his client in aught, and no help can they receive, except such as receive God's mercy. For He is Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. Verily the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinful, like molten brass; it will boil in their insides like the boiling of scalding water. A voice will cry: "Seize him and drag him into the midst of the blazing fire! Then pour over his head the penalty of boiling water. Taste this! Truly you were mighty, full of honor! This is what you used to doubt!" As to the righteous, they will be in a position of security, among gardens and springs, dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing each other. We shall join them to fair women with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes. There they can call for every kind of fruit in peace and security. They will not taste death there, except the first death, and He will preserve them from the penalty of the blazing fire, as a bounty from your Lord. That will be the supreme achievement! Verily, We have made this Qur'an easy in your tongue, in order that they may give heed. So wait and watch, for they too are waiting.He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him), frequently. And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them, through selfish envy among themselves. Had it not been for a Word from your Lord, the matter would have been settled between them. Those who inherited the Book after them are in doubt concerning it. Now then, call them to the Faith, and stand steadfast as you are commanded. Say: "I believe in the Book which God has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justly between you. God is our Lord and your Lord: for us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. God will bring us together, and to Him is our Final Goal." But those who dispute concerning God after He has been accepted, their dispute is futile in the Sight of their Lord: on them will be a terrible Penalty. It is God Who has sent down the Book in Truth, and the Balance. And what will make you realize that perhaps the Hour is close at hand? Only those who do not believe in it wish to hasten it, while those who believe hold it in awe and know that it is the Truth. Behold, those who dispute concerning the Hour are far astray. Gracious is God to His servants: He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases, and He has power and can carry out His Will. To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter, We give increase in his tilth, and to any that desires the tilth of this world, We grant somewhat thereof, but he has no share in the Hereafter. What! Have they partners who have established for them some religion without the permission of God? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment, the matter would have been decided between them. But the wrongdoers will have a grievous Penalty. You will see the wrongdoers in fear on account of what they have earned, and that must fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens: they shall have, before their Lord, all that they wish for. That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty of God. That is the Bounty whereof God gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin." And if anyone earns any good, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate service. What! Do they say, "He has forged a falsehood against God"? But if God willed, He could seal up your heart. And God blots out Vanity and proves the Truth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts. He is the One that accepts repentance from His Servants and forgives sins: and He knows all that you do. And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers, there is a terrible Penalty. If God were to enlarge the provision for His Servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but He sends it down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well acquainted, Watchful. He is the One that sends down rain even after men have given up all hope, and scatters His Mercy far and wide. And He is the Protector, Worthy of all Praise. And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gather them together when He wills. Whatever misfortune happens to you is because of the things your hands have wrought, and for many of them, He grants forgiveness.Lo! in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers. In the creation of yourselves and the animals scattered through the earth, there are signs for those of assured faith. In the alternation of night and day, and the sustenance God sends from the sky, reviving the earth after its death, and the changing of the winds, are signs for those who are wise. These are the signs of God, which we rehearse in truth; then in what exposition will they believe after rejecting God and His signs?

Woe to each sinful liar who hears the signs of God but remains obstinate and lofty, as if he had not heard them. Announce to him a grievous penalty. When he learns something of Our signs, he takes them in jest; for such, there will be a humiliating penalty. In front of them is Hell, and nothing they have earned or any protectors they have taken besides God will benefit them. For them is a tremendous penalty.

This is true guidance, and for those who reject the signs of their Lord, there is a grievous penalty of abomination. God has subjected the sea to you, that ships may sail through it by His command, that you may seek His bounty and be grateful. He has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and on earth; in that are signs for those who reflect.

Tell those who believe to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of God; it is for Him to recompense each people according to what they have earned. Whoever does a righteous deed, it benefits his own soul; if he does evil, it works against his own soul. In the end, you will be brought back to your Lord.

We granted the Children of Israel the Book, the Power of Command, and Prophethood; We gave them good and pure sustenance and favored them above the nations. We granted them clear signs in religious affairs, but they fell into schisms through insolent envy among themselves. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences.

We put you on the right way of religion, so follow it and do not follow the desires of those who know not. They will be of no use to you in the sight of God; only wrong-doers stand as protectors to one another, but God is the Protector of the Righteous. These are clear evidences to men and a guidance and mercy to those of assured faith.

Do those who seek after evil ways think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous deeds? Ill is the judgment they make. God created the heavens and the earth for just ends, so that each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned, and none will be wronged.

Have you seen the one who takes his own vain desire as his god? God has left him astray, sealed his hearing and heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who will guide him after God has withdrawn guidance? Will you not then receive admonition?

They say: "What is there but our life in this world? We shall die and live, and nothing but time can destroy us." But they have no knowledge of that; they merely conjecture. When Our clear signs are rehearsed to them, their argument is nothing but this: "Bring back our forefathers if what you say is true!" Say: "It is God who gives you life, then gives you death.""Say: God gives you life, then causes you to die, then gathers you for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt. But most people do not understand. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and on the Day the Hour of Judgment is established, those who follow falsehood will perish. Every sect will be called to its record: 'This Day you shall be recompensed for all that you did!' This Our Record speaks about you with truth: We recorded all that you did. Those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to His Mercy, a manifest achievement. But those who rejected God will be told: 'Were not Our Signs rehearsed to you? But you were arrogant and sinful!' When it was said that the promise of God was true and the Hour was certain, you doubted it. The evil consequences of what they did will become manifest to them, and they will be encircled by what they mocked. It will be said: 'This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! Your abode is the Fire, and you have no helpers.' This is because you took the Signs of God in jest and were deceived by the life of the world. So, on that Day, they will not be taken out of the Fire, nor will they be received into Grace. Praise be to God, Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of all the Worlds. To Him belongs glory throughout the heavens and the earth, and He is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom."Nor can you escape through the earth; nor have you, besides God, anyone to protect or help. Among His Signs are the ships, smooth-running through the ocean, tall as mountains. If it be His Will, He can still the wind, making them motionless on the ocean. In this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful. He can cause them to perish because of the evil they have earned, but much does He forgive. Those who dispute about Our Signs have no way of escape. Whatever you are given is but a convenience of this life, but what is with God is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord. Those who avoid greater crimes and shameful deeds, and when they are angry, forgive. Those who hearken to their Lord, establish regular Prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and spend out of what We bestow on them for sustenance. Those who, when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them, help and defend themselves. The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto, but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from God. If any help and defend themselves after a wrong done to them, there is no cause of blame. The blame is only against those who oppress men and transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice. For such, there will be a grievous penalty. If any show patience and forgive, that is an exercise of courageous will and resolution. For any whom God leaves astray, there is no protector thereafter. You will see the wrongdoers, when in sight of the penalty, saying, "Is there any way to return?" They will be brought forward to the penalty, in a humble frame of mind because of their disgrace, looking with a stealthy glance. The believers will say, "Those are indeed in loss, who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment." Truly, the wrongdoers are in a lasting penalty. They have no protectors to help them, other than God. For any whom God leaves to stray, there is no way to the goal. Hearken to your Lord before there comes a Day which there will be no putting back. That Day, there will be no place of refuge nor any room for denial of your sins. If they run away, We have not sent you as a guard over them. Your duty is but to convey the message. When We give man a taste of mercy from Us, he exults thereat, but when some ill happens to him on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth, man is ungrateful. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills and bestows children, male or female, according to His Will. He bestows both males and females, and leaves barren whom He will. He is full of Knowledge and Power. It is not fitting for a man that God should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal, with God's permission, what God wills. He is Most High, Most Wise. Thus have We, by Our Command, sent inspiration to you. You did not know what was Revelation, nor what was Faith, but We have made the Qur'an a Light, guiding whom We will of Our servants. You guide men to the Straight Way, the Way of God, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth. All affairs tend towards God.And since they will not be guided by it, they say: This is an ancient lie. Those who disbelieve say concerning those who believe: If it had been good, they would not have gone ahead of us therein. And as they do not seek to be rightly directed thereby, they say: It is an old lie.

Before this, was the Book of Moses as a guide and a mercy: And this Book confirms it in the Arabic tongue; to admonish the unjust, and as Glad Tidings to those who do right. When before it there was the Scripture of Moses, an example and a mercy; and this is a confirming Scripture in the Arabic language, that it may warn those who do wrong and bring good tidings for the righteous.

Verily those who say, "Our Lord is God," and remain firm on that path, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who say: Our Lord is God, and thereafter walk aright, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. Surely those who say, Our Lord is God, then they continue on the right way, they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.

Such shall be Companions of the Gardens, dwelling therein forever: a recompense for their good deeds. Such are rightful owners of the Garden, immortal therein, as a reward for what they used to do. These are the dwellers of the garden, abiding therein: a reward for what they did.

We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: In pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth. The carrying of the child to his weaning is a period of thirty months. At length, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years, he says, "O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favor which Thou has bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and be gracious to me in my issue. Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow in Islam." And We have commended unto man kindness toward parents. His mother bears him with reluctance, and brings him forth with reluctance, and the bearing of him and the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attains full strength and reaches forty years, he says: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for the favor wherewith Thou hast favored me and my parents, and that I may do right acceptable unto Thee. And be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed. Lo! I have turned unto Thee repentant, and lo! I am of those who surrender unto Thee. And We have enjoined on man doing of good to his parents; with trouble did his mother bear him and with trouble did she bring him forth; and the bearing of him and the weaning of him was thirty months; until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years, he says: My Lord! grant me that I may give thanks for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do good which pleases Thee and do good to me in respect of my offspring; surely I turn to Thee, and surely I am of those who submit.

Such are they from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and pass by their ill deeds: They shall be among the Companions of the Garden: a promise of truth, which was made to them in this life. Those are they from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook their evil deeds. They are among the owners of the Garden. This is the true promise which they were promised in the world. These are they from whom We accept the best of what they have done and pass over their evil deeds, among the dwellers of the garden; the promise of truth which they were promised.

But there is one who says to his parents, "Fie on you! Do you hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up, even though generations have passed before me without rising again?" And they two seek God's aid, and rebuke the son: "Woe to thee! Have faith! for the promise of God is true." But he says, "This is nothing but tales of the ancients!" And whoso says unto his parents: Fie upon you both! Do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth again when generations before me have passed away? And they cry unto God for help and say: Woe unto thee! Believe! Lo! the promise of God is true. But he says: This is naught save fables of the men of old. And he who says to his parents: Fie on you! Do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations have already passed away before me? And they both call for God's aid: Woe to you! Believe, surely the promise of God is true. But he says: This is nothing but stories of the ancients.

Such are they against whom is proved the sentence among the previous generations of jinns and men, that have passed away; for they will be utterly lost. Such are those on whom the Word concerning nations of the jinn and mankind which have passed away before them has effect. Lo! they are the losers. These are they against whom the word has proved true among nations of the jinn and the men that have already passed away before them; surely they are losers.

And to all are assigned degrees according to the deeds which they have done, and in order that God may recompense their deeds, and no injustice be done to them. And for all there will be ranks from what they do, that He may pay them for their deeds; and they will not be wronged. And for all are degrees according to what they did, and that He may pay them back fully their deeds and they shall not be wronged.

And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, it will be said to them: "You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure out of them: but today you shall be recompensed with a Penalty of humiliation: for that you were arrogant on earth without just cause, and that you ever transgressed." And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire it will be said: You squandered your good things in the life of the world and sought comfort therein. Now this day you are rewarded with the doom of ignominy because you were disdainful in the land without a right, and because you used to transgress. And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire: You did away with your good things in your life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while, so today you shall be rewarded with the punishment of abasement because you were unjustly proud in the land and because you transgressed.

Mention Hud, one of 'Ad's own brethren: Behold, he warned his people about the winding Sand-tracts: but there have been warners before him and after him: "Worship none other than God: Truly I fear for you the Penalty of a Mighty Day." And make mention of the brother of A'ad when he warned his folk among the wind-curved sandhills - and verily warners came and went before and after him - saying: Serve none but God. Lo! I fear for you the doom of a tremendous Day. And mention the brother of Ad; when he warned his people in the sandy plains, and indeed warners came before him and after him saying Serve none but God; surely I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day.

They said: "Have you come in order to turn us aside from our gods? Then bring upon us the calamity with which you threaten us, if you are telling the truth?" They said: Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Then bring upon us that wherewith you threaten us, if you are of the truthful. They said: Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods; then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones.

He said: "The Knowledge of when it will come is only with God: I proclaim to you the mission on which I have been sent: But I see that you are a people in ignorance!" He said: The knowledge is with God only. I convey unto you that wherewith I have been sent, but I see you are a folk that know not. He said: The knowledge is only with God, and I deliver to you the message with which I am sent, but I see you are a people who are ignorant.

Then, when they saw the Penalty in the shape of a cloud traversing the sky, coming to meet their valleys, they said, "This cloud will give us rain!" "Nay, it is the Calamity you were asking to be hastened! A wind wherein is a Grievous Penalty!" Then, when they beheld it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys, they said: Here is a cloud bringing us rain. Nay, but it is that which you did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is painful torment. So when they saw it as a cloud appearing in the sky advancing towards their valleys, they said: This is a cloud which will give us rain. Nay! it is what you sought to hasten on, a blast of wind in which is a painful punishment.

"Everything will it destroy by the command of its Lord!" Then by the morning they - nothing was to be seen but the ruins of their houses! Thus do We recompense those given to sin! Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord. And morning found them so that naught could be seen save their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty folk. Destroying everything by the command of its Lord, so they became such that naught could be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty people.

And We had firmly established them in a prosperity and power which We have not given to you, and We had endowed them with faculties of hearing, seeing, heart and intellect: but of no profit to them were their faculties of hearing, sight, and heart and intellect, when they went on rejecting the Signs of God; and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at! And verily We had empowered them with that wherewith We have not empowered you, and had assigned them ears and eyes and hearts; but their ears and eyes and hearts availed them naught since they denied the revelations of God; and what they used to mock befell them. And certainly We had established them in what We have not established you in, and We had given them ears and eyes and hearts, but neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts availed them aught, since they denied the communications of God, and that which they mocked encompassed them.

We destroyed aforetime populations round about you; and We have shown the Signs in various ways, that they may turn to Us. And verily We have destroyed townships round about you, and displayed for them Our revelation, that haply they might return. And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around you, and We repeat the communications that they might turn.is in the earth; now surely to God do all affairs eventually come. - Chapter 43: AZ-ZUKHRUF (ORNAMENTS OF GOLD, LUXURY) Total Verses: 89 Revealed At: MAKKA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 043.001 Y: Ha-Mim.

P: And never came there unto them a prophet but they used to mock him. S: And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him. 043.008 Y: So We destroyed (them)- stronger in power than these;- and (thus) has passed on the Parable of the peoples of old. P: Then We destroyed men mightier than these in prowess; and the example of the men of old hath gone (before them). S: Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess, and the case of the ancients has gone before, 043.009 Y: If thou wert to question them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' They would be sure to reply, 'they were created by (Him), the Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge';- P: And if thou (Muhammad) ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer: The Mighty, the Knower created them; S: And if you should ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth? they would most certainly say: The Mighty, the Knowing One, has created them; 043.010 Y: (Yea, the same that) has made for you the earth (like a carpet) spread out, and has made for you roads (and channels) therein, in order that ye may find guidance (on the way); P: Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and placed roads for you therein, that haply ye may find your way; S: He Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and made in it ways for you that you may go aright; 043.011 Y: That sends down (from time to time) rain from the sky in due measure;- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised (from the dead);- P: And Who sendeth down water from the sky in (due) measure, and We revive a dead land therewith.

S: And He Who created pairs of all things, and made for you of the ships and the cattle what you ride on, 043.013 Y: In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs, and when so seated, ye may celebrate the (kind) favour of your Lord, and say, "Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use), for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves)," P: That ye may mount upon their backs, and may remember your Lord's favour when ye mount thereon, and may say: Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto us, and we were not capable (of subduing them); S: That you may firmly sit on their backs, then remember the favor of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon, and say: Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us and we were not able to do it, 043.014 Y: "And to our Lord, surely, must we turn back!" P: And lo! unto our Lord we surely are returning. S: And surely to our Lord we must return. 043.015 Y: Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him (in his godhead)! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed! P: And they allot to Him a portion of His bondmen! Lo! man is verily a mere ingrate. S: And they assign to Him a part of His servants; man, to be sure, is clearly ungrateful. 043.016 Y: What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates, and granted to you sons for choice? P: Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created, and honoureth He you with sons? S: What! has He taken daughters to Himself of what He Himself creates and chosen you to have sons? 043.017 Y: When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (God) Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief! P: And if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the Beneficent One, his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage. S: And when one of them is given news of that of which he sets up as a likeness for the Beneficent God, his face becomes black and he is full of rage. 043.018 Y: Is then one brought up among trinkets, and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with God)? P: (Liken they then to God) that which is bred up in outward show, and in dispute cannot make itself plain? S: What! that which is made in ornaments and which in contention is unable to make plain speech! 043.019 Y: And they make into females angels who themselves serve God. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded, and they will be called to account! P: And they make the angels, who are the slaves of the Beneficent, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned. S: And they make the angels them who are the servants of the Beneficent God female (divinities). What! did they witness their creation? Their evidence shall be written down and they shall be questioned. 043.020 Y: ("Ah!") they say, "If it had been the will of (God) Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped such (deities)!" Of that they have no knowledge! they do nothing but lie! P: And they say: If the Beneficent One had (so) willed, we should not have worshipped them. They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do but guess. S: And they say: If the Beneficent God had pleased, we should never have worshipped them. They have no knowledge of this; they only lie. 043.021 Y: What! have We given them a Book before this, to which they are holding fast? P: Or have We given them any scripture before (this Qur'an) so that they are holding fast thereto? S: Or have We given them a book before it so that they hold fast to it? 043.022 Y: Nay! they say: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps." P: Nay, for they say only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are guided by their footprints. S: Nay! they say: We found our fathers on a course, and surely we are guided by their footsteps. 043.023 Y: Just in the same way, whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people, the wealthy ones among them said: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we will certainly follow in their footsteps." P: And even so We sent not a warner before thee (Muhammad) into any township but its luxurious ones said: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are following their footprints. S: And thus, We did not send before you any warner in a town, but those who led easy lives in it said: Surely we found our fathers on a course, and surely we are followers of their footsteps. 043.024 Y: He said: "What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following?" They said: "For us, we deny that ye (prophets) are sent (on a mission at all)." P: (And the warner) said: What! Even though I bring you better guidance than that ye found your fathers following? They answered: Lo! in what ye bring we are disbelievers. S: (The warner) said: What! even if I bring to you a better guide than that on which you found your fathers? They said: Surely we are unbelievers in that with which you are sent. 043.025 Y: So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected (Truth)! P: So We requited them. Then see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters! S: So We inflicted retribution on them, then see how was the end of the rejecters. 043.026 Y: Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: "I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship:" P: And when Abraham said unto his father and his folk: Lo! I am innocent of what ye worship S: And when Ibrahim said to his father and his people: Surely I am clear of what you worship, 043.027 Y: "(I worship) only Him Who made me, and He will certainly guide me." P: Save Him Who did create me, for He will surely guide me. S: Save Him Who created me, for surely He will guide me. 043.028 Y: And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him, that they may turn back (to God). P: And he made it a word enduring among his seed, that haply they might return. S: And he made it a word to continue in his posterity that they may return. 043.029 Y: Yea, I have given the good things of this life to these (men) and their fathers, until the Truth has come to them, and a messenger making things clear. P: Nay, but I let these and their fathers enjoy life (only) till there should come unto them the Truth and a messenger making plain. S: Nay! I gave them and their fathers to enjoy until there came to them the truth and a Messenger making manifest (the truth). 043.030 Y: But when the Truth came to them, they said: "This is sorcery, and we do reject it." P: And now that the Truth hath come unto them they say: This is mere magic, and lo! we are disbelievers therein. S: And when there came to them the truth they said: This is magic, and surely we are disbelievers in it. 043.031 Y: Also, they say: "Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities?" P: And they say: If only this Qur'an had been revealed to some great man of the two towns? S: And they say: Why was not this Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns? 043.032 Y: Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks, so that some may command work from others. But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the (wealth) which they amass. P: Is itthey who apportion thy Lord's mercy? We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in rank that some of them may take labor from others; and the mercy of thy Lord is better than the wealth they amass. Will they distribute the mercy of your Lord? We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world, and We have exalted some of them above others in degrees, that some of them may take others in subjection; and the mercy of your Lord is better than what they amass.

And were it not that all men might become of one evil way of life, We would provide, for everyone that blasphemes against God Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses and silver stairways on which to go up, and silver doors to their houses, and thrones of silver on which they could recline, and also adornments of gold. But all this is nothing but conveniences of the present life: The Hereafter, in the sight of thy Lord, is for the Righteous.

If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of God Most Gracious, We appoint for him an evil one, to be an intimate companion to him. Such evil ones really hinder them from the Path, but they think that they are being guided aright! At length, when such a one comes to Us, he says to his evil companion: "Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!" Ah! evil is the companion indeed! When ye have done wrong, it will avail you nothing, that Day, that ye shall be partners in Punishment!

Canst thou then make the deaf to hear, or give direction to the blind or to such as wander in manifest error? Even if We take thee away, We shall be sure to exact retribution from them, or We shall show thee that accomplished which We have promised them: for verily We shall prevail over them. So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee; verily thou art on a Straight Way. The Qur'an is indeed the message, for thee and for thy people; and soon shall ye all be brought to account.

And question thou our messengers whom We sent before thee: did We appoint any deities other than God Most Gracious, to be worshipped? We did send Moses aforetime, with Our Signs, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: He said, "I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds." But when he came to them with Our Signs, behold they ridiculed them. We showed them Sign after Sign, each greater than its fellow, and We seized them with Punishment, in order that they might turn to Us.

And they said, "O thou sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord for us according to His covenant with thee; for we shall truly accept guidance." But when We removed the Penalty from them, behold, they broke their word. And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying: "O my people! Does not the dominion of Egypt belong to me, with these streams flowing underneath my palace? What! see ye not then? Am I not better than this Moses, who is a contemptible wretch and can scarcely express himself clearly? Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him, or why come not with him angels accompanying him in procession?"

Thus did he make fools of his people, and they obeyed him: truly were they a people rebellious against God. When at length they provoked Us, We exacted retribution from them, and We drowned them all. And We made them a people of the Past and an Example to later ages.

When Jesus the son of Mary is held up as an example, behold, thy people raise a clamor thereat in ridicule! And they say, "Are our gods better, or he?" This they set forth to thee, only by way of disputation: yea, they are a contentious people. He was no more than a servant: We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel. And if it were Our Will, We could make angels from amongst you, succeeding each other on the earth.

And Jesus shall be a Sign for the coming of the Hour of Judgment: therefore have no doubt about the Hour, but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way. Let not the Evil One hinder you: for he is to you an enemy avowed.o help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped as gods, besides God, as a means of access (to God)? Nay, they left them in the lurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention. Then why did those whom they had chosen for gods as a way of approach (unto God) not help them? Nay, but they did fail them utterly. And (all) that was their lie, and what they used to invent.

Behold, We turned towards thee a company of jinns (quietly) listening to the Qur'an: when they stood in the presence thereof, they said, "Listen in silence!" When the (reading) was finished, they returned to their people, to warn (them of their sins). And when We inclined toward thee (Muhammad) certain of the jinn, who wished to hear the Qur'an and, when they were in its presence, said: Give ear! and, when it was finished, turned back to their people, warning.

They said, "O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it: it guides (men) to the Truth and to a Straight Path." They said: O our people! Lo! we have heard a Scripture which hath been revealed after Moses, confirming that which was before it, guiding unto the truth and a right road.

"O our people, hearken to the one who invites (you) to God, and believe in him: He will forgive you your faults, and deliver you from a Penalty Grievous." O our people! respond to God's summoner and believe in Him. He will forgive you some of your sins and guard you from a painful doom.

"If any does not hearken to the one who invites (us) to God, he cannot frustrate (God's Plan) on earth, and no protectors can he have besides God: such men (wander) in manifest error." And whoso respondeth not to God's summoner he can nowise escape in the earth, and he hath no protecting friends instead of Him. Such are in error manifest.

See they not that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, and never wearied with their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yea, verily He has power over all things. Have they not seen that God, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead? Aye, He verily is Able to do all things.

And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (they will be asked,) "Is this not the Truth?" they will say, "Yea, by our Lord!" (One will say:) "Then taste ye the Penalty, for that ye were wont to deny (Truth)!" And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire (they will be asked): Is not this real? They will say: Yea, by our Lord. He will say: Then taste the doom for that ye disbelieved.

Therefore patiently persevere, as did (all) messengers of inflexible purpose; and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them, (it will be) as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day. (Thine but) to proclaim the Message: but shall any be destroyed except those who transgress? Then have patience (O Muhammad) even as the stout of heart among the messengers (of old) had patience, and seek not to hasten on (the doom) for them. On the day when they see that which they are promised (it will seem to them) as though they had tarried but an hour of daylight. A clear message. Shall any be destroyed save evil-living folk?

Therefore bear up patiently as did the messengers endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom). On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not tarried save an hour of the day. A sufficient exposition! Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people?

Chapter 47: MUHAMMAD (MUHAMMAD)
Total Verses: 38
Revealed At: MADINA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Those who reject God and hinder (men) from the Path of God,- their deeds will God render astray (from their mark). Those who disbelieve and turn (men) from the way of God, He rendereth their actions vain. (As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from God's way, He shall render their works ineffective.

But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and believe in the (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord,- He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition. And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed unto Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He riddeth them of their ill-deeds and improveth their state. And (as for) those who believe and do good, and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad, and it is the very truth from their Lord, He will remove their evil from them and improve their condition.

This because those who reject God follow vanities, while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord: Thus does God set forth for men their lessons by similitudes. That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus God coineth their similitudes for mankind. That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.

Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been God's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of God,- He will never let their deeds be lost. Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if God willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of God, He rendereth not their actions vain. So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if God had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of God, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.

Soon will He guide them and improve their condition, He will guide them and improve their state, He will guide them and improve their condition.

And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them. And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them. And cause them to enter the garden which He has made known to them.

O ye who believe! If ye will aid (the cause of) God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. O ye who believe! If ye help God, He will help you and will make your foothold firm. O you who believe! if you help (the cause of) God, He will help you and make firm your feet.

But those who reject (God),- for them is destruction, and (God) will render their deeds astray (from their mark). And those who disbelieve, perdition is for them, and He will make their actions vain. And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective.

That is because they hate the Revelation of God; so He has made their deeds fruitless. That is because they are averse to that which God hath revealed, therefore maketh He their actions fruitless. That is because they hated what God revealed, so He rendered their deeds null.

Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of those before them (who did evil)? God brought utter destruction on them, and similar (fates await) those who reject God. Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? God wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof. Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them: God brought down destruction upon them, and the unbelievers shall have the like of it.

That is because God is the Protector of those who believe, but those who reject God have no protector. That is because God is patron of those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no patron. That is because God is the Protector of those who believe, and because the unbelievers shall have no protector for them.

Verily God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject God will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode. Lo! God will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; while those who disbelieve take their comfort in this life and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire is their habitation. Surely God will make those who believe and do good enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; and those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire is their abode."Let not Satan turn you aside. He is an open enemy for you. When Jesus came with clear signs, he said: 'Now I have come to you with wisdom, and to make clear to you some of the points on which you dispute: therefore fear God and obey me.' When Jesus came with clear proofs of God's sovereignty, he said: 'I have come unto you with wisdom, and to make plain some of that concerning which you differ. So keep your duty to God and obey me.' For God, He is my Lord and your Lord: so worship Him: this is a straight way. But sects from among themselves fell into disagreement: then woe to the wrong-doers, from the penalty of a grievous day! Do they only wait for the Hour - that it should come on them all of a sudden, while they perceive not? Friends on that day will be foes, one to another, except the righteous. My devotees! No fear shall be on you that day, nor shall you grieve. Those who have believed in Our signs and bowed their wills to Ours in Islam. Enter ye the Garden, ye and your wives, in beauty and rejoicing. To them will be passed round dishes and goblets of gold: there will be all that the souls could desire, all that their eyes could delight in: and ye shall abide therein forever. Such will be the Garden of which ye are made heirs for your good deeds in life. Ye shall have therein abundance of fruit, from which ye shall have satisfaction. The sinners will be in the punishment of Hell, to dwell therein forever. The punishment will not be lightened for them, and in despair will they be there overwhelmed. We wronged them not, but they it was who did the wrong. They will cry: 'O Malik! Would that thy Lord put an end to us!' He will say, 'Nay, but ye shall abide!' Verily We have brought the Truth to you: but most of you have a hatred for Truth. What! Have they settled some plan among themselves? But it is We who settle things. Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels? Indeed, We do, and Our messengers are by them, to record. Say: 'If God Most Gracious had a son, I would be the first to worship.' Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne of Authority! He is free from the things they attribute to Him! So leave them to babble and play with vanities until they meet that Day of theirs, which they have been promised. It is He Who is God in heaven and God on earth; and He is full of wisdom and knowledge. And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all between them: with Him is the knowledge of the Hour of Judgment: and to Him shall ye be brought back. And those whom they invoke besides God have no power of intercession; only he who bears witness to the Truth, and they know him. If thou ask them, who created them, they will certainly say, God: How then are they deluded away from the Truth? God has knowledge of the Prophet's cry, 'O my Lord! Truly these are people who will not believe!' But turn away from them, and say 'Peace!' But soon shall they know!""Our Lord! Remove the penalty from us, for we do really believe!" They will say: "Our Lord, relieve us of the torment. We are believers." How can there be remembrance for them when a messenger making plain the truth had already come to them? Yet they turn away from him and say: "Tutored by others, a man possessed!" We shall indeed remove the penalty for a while, but truly they will revert to their ways. One day We shall seize you with a mighty onslaught: We will indeed exact retribution! We did, before them, try the people of Pharaoh: there came to them a messenger most honorable, saying: "Restore to me the servants of God: I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust; and be not arrogant against God: for I come to you with authority manifest." For me, I have sought safety with my Lord and your Lord, against your injuring me. If you believe me not, at least keep yourselves away from me. But they were aggressive, then he cried to his Lord: "These are indeed a people given to sin." The reply came: "March forth with My servants by night: for you are sure to be pursued. And leave the sea as a furrow divided: for they are a host destined to be drowned." How many were the gardens and springs they left behind, and corn-fields and noble buildings, and wealth wherein they had taken such delight! Thus was their end, and We made other people inherit those things. Neither heaven nor earth shed a tear over them, nor were they given a respite again. We did deliver aforetime the Children of Israel from humiliating punishment, inflicted by Pharaoh, for he was arrogant among inordinate transgressors. And We chose them aforetime above the nations, knowingly, and granted them signs in which there was a manifest trial. As to these (Quraish), they say: "There is nothing beyond our first death, and we shall not be raised again. Then bring back our forefathers, if what you say is true!" Are they better than the people of Tubba and those who were before them? We destroyed them because they were guilty of sin. We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, merely in idle sport. We created them not except for just ends, but most of them do not understand. Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them, the day when no protector can avail his client in aught, and no help can they receive, except such as receive God's mercy: for He is Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. Verily the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinful, like molten brass; it will boil in their insides, like the boiling of scalding water. A voice will cry: "Seize him and drag him into the midst of the blazing fire! Then pour over his head the penalty of boiling water. Taste this! Truly you were mighty, full of honor! Truly this is what you used to doubt!" As to the righteous, they will be in a position of security, among gardens and springs, dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing each other. So it will be, and We shall join them to fair women with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes. There they can call for every kind of fruit in peace and security. Nor will they taste death there, except the first death; and He will preserve them from the penalty of the blazing fire, as a bounty from your Lord! That will be the supreme achievement! Verily, We have made this Qur'an easy in your tongue, in order that they may give heed. So wait and watch, for they too are waiting.Lo! in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers. In the creation of yourselves and the scattering of animals through the earth, there are signs for those of assured faith. In the alternation of night and day, the sustenance God sends from the sky, reviving the earth after its death, and the changing of the winds, are signs for those who are wise. These are the signs of God, which we rehearse to you in truth. Woe to each sinful liar who hears the signs of God and remains obstinate. Announce to him a grievous penalty. When he learns of our signs, he takes them in jest; for such, there will be a humiliating penalty. In front of them is Hell, and nothing they have earned or any protectors besides God will avail them. This is true guidance, and for those who reject the signs of their Lord, there is a grievous penalty. God has subjected the sea to you, that ships may sail through it by His command, and that you may seek His bounty and be grateful. He has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and on earth. In that are signs for those who reflect. Tell those who believe to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of God. It is for Him to recompense each people according to what they have earned. Whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against himself. In the end, you will be brought back to your Lord. We granted the Children of Israel the Book, the Power of Command, and Prophethood, and favored them above the nations. We granted them clear signs in religious affairs, but they fell into schisms through insolent envy among themselves. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment. We have set you on a clear path of commandment; follow it and do not follow the desires of those who know not. They will be of no use to you in the sight of God. Wrong-doers are protectors of one another, but God is the Protector of the Righteous. These are clear evidences to men and a guidance and mercy to those of assured faith. Do those who seek after evil ways think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous deeds? Ill is the judgment they make. God created the heavens and the earth for just ends, so that each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned, and none will be wronged. Have you seen the one who takes his own vain desire as his god? God has left him astray, sealed his hearing and heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who will guide him after God has withdrawn guidance? Will you not then receive admonition? They say, "What is there but our life in this world? We shall die and live, and nothing but time can destroy us." But they have no knowledge of that; they merely conjecture. When Our clear signs are rehearsed to them, their argument is nothing but this: "Bring back our forefathers if what you say is true!" Say: "It is God who gives you life, then gives you death."at as the beasts eat, and the fire is their abode.

047.013 Y: And how many cities, with more power than thy city which has driven thee out, have We destroyed (for their sins)? and there was none to aid them. P: And how many a township stronger than thy township (O Muhammad) which hath cast thee out, have We destroyed, and they had no helper! S: And how many a town which was far more powerful than the town of yours which has driven you out: We destroyed them so there was no helper for them.

047.014 Y: Is then one who is on a clear (Path) from his Lord, no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing, and such as follow their own lusts? P: Is he who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord like those for whom the evil that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts? S: What! is he who has a clear argument from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fairseeming: and they follow their low desires.

047.015 Y: (Here is) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in it are rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces)? P: A similitude of the Garden which those who keep their duty (to God) are promised: Therein are rivers of water unpolluted, and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of clear-run honey; therein for them is every kind of fruit, with pardon from their Lord. (Are those who enjoy all this) like those who are immortal in the Fire and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their bowels? S: A parable of the garden which those guarding (against evil) are promised: Therein are rivers of water that does not alter, and rivers of milk the taste whereof does not change, and rivers of drink delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey clarified and for them therein are all fruits and protection from their Lord. (Are these) like those who abide in the fire and who are made to drink boiling water so it rends their bowels asunder.

047.016 Y: And among them are men who listen to thee, but in the end, when they go out from thee, they say to those who have received Knowledge, "What is it he said just then?" Such are men whose hearts God has sealed, and who follow their own lusts. P: Among them are some who give ear unto thee (Muhammad) till, when they go forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge: What was that he said just now? Those are they whose hearts God hath sealed, and they follow their own lusts. S: And there are those of them who seek to listen to you, until when they go forth from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge: What was it that he said just now? These are they upon whose hearts God has set a seal and they follow their low desires.

047.017 Y: But to those who receive Guidance, He increases the (light of) Guidance, and bestows on them their Piety and Restraint (from evil). P: While as for those who walk aright, He addeth to their guidance, and giveth them their protection (against evil). S: And (as for) those who follow the right direction, He increases them in guidance and gives them their guarding (against evil).

047.018 Y: Do they then only wait for the Hour,- that it should come on them of a sudden? But already have come some tokens thereof, and when it (actually) is on them, how can they benefit then by their admonition? P: Await they aught save the Hour, that it should come upon them unawares? And the beginnings thereof have already come. But how, when it hath come upon them, can they take their warning? S: Do they then wait for aught but the hour that it should come to them all of a sudden? Now indeed the tokens of it have (already) come, but how shall they have their reminder when it comes on them?

047.019 Y: Know, therefore, that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and for the men and women who believe: for God knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes. P: So know (O Muhammad) that there is no God save God, and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women. God knoweth (both) your place of turmoil and your place of rest. S: So know that there is no god but God, and, ask protection for your fault and for the believing men and the believing women; and God knows the place of your returning and the place of your abiding.

047.020 Y: Those who believe say, "Why is not a sura sent down (for us)?" But when a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein, thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with a look of one in swoon at the approach of death. But more fitting for them- P: And those who believe say: If only a surah were revealed! But when a decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto death. Therefor woe unto them! S: And those who believe say: Why has not a Chapter been revealed? But when a decisive Chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is a disease look to you with the look of one fainting because of death. Woe to them then!

047.021 Y: Were it to obey and say what is just, and when a matter is resolved on, it were best for them if they were true to God. P: Obedience and a civil word. Then, when the matter is determined, if they are loyal to God it will be well for them. S: Obedience and a gentle word (was proper); but when the affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to God it would certainly be better for them.

047.022 Y: Then, is it to be expected of you, if ye were put in authority, that ye will do mischief in the land, and break your ties of kith and kin? P: Would ye then, if ye were given the command, work corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship? S: But if you held command, you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship!

047.023 Y: Such are the men whom God has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight. P: Such are they whom God curseth so that He deafeneth them and maketh blind their eyes. S: Those it is whom God has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes.

047.024 Y: Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up by them? P: Will they then not meditate on the Qur'an, or are there locks on the hearts? S: Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Nay, on the hearts there are locks.

047.025 Y: Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them,- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes. P: Lo! those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, Satan hath seduced them, and He giveth them the rein. S: Surely (as for) those who return on their backs after that guidance has become manifest to them, the Shaitan has made it a light matter to them; and He gives them respite.

047.026 Y: This, because they said to those who hate what God has revealed, "We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but God knows their (inner) secrets. P: That is because they say unto those who hate what God hath revealed: We will obey you in some matters; and God knoweth their secret talk. S: That is because they say to those who hate what God has revealed: We will obey you in some of the affairs; and God knows their secrets.

047.027 Y: But how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death, and smite their faces and their backs? P: Then how (will it be with them) when the angels gather them, smiting their faces and their backs! S: But how will it be when the angels cause them to die smiting their backs.

047.028 Y: This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of God, and they hated God's good pleasure; so He made their deeds of no effect. P: That will be because they followed that which angereth God, and hated that which pleaseth Him. Therefore He hath made their actions vain. S: That is because they follow what is displeasing to God and are averse to His pleasure, therefore He has made null their deeds.

047.029 Y: Or do those in whose hearts is a disease, think that God will not bring to light all their rancour? P: Or do those in whose hearts is a disease deem that God will not bring to light their (secret) hates? S: Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that God will not bring forth their spite?

047.030 Y: Had We so willed, We could have shown them up to thee, and thou shouldst have known them by their marks: but surely thou wilt know them by the tone of their speech! And God knows all that ye do. P: And if We would, We could show them unto thee (Muhammad) so that thou shouldst know them surely by their marks. And thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk. And God knoweth your deeds. S: And if We please We would have made you know them so that you would certainly have recognized them by their marks and most certainly you can recognize them by the intent of (their) speech; and God knows your deeds.

047.031 Y: And We shall try you until We test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience; and We shall try your reported (mettle). P: And verily We shall try you till We know those of you who strive hard (for the cause of God) and the steadfast, and till We test your record. S: And most certainly We will try you until We have known those among you who exert themselves hard, and the patient, and made your case manifest.

047.032 Y: Those who reject God, hinder (men) from the Path of God, and resist the Messenger, after Guidance has been clearly shown to them, will not injure God in the least, but He will make their deeds of no effect. P: Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of God and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, they hurt God not a jot, and He will make their actions fruitless. S: Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from God's way and oppose the Messenger after that guidance has become clear to them cannot harm God in any way, and He will make null their deeds.

047.033 Y: O ye who believe! Obey God, and obey the messenger, and make not vain your deeds! P: O ye who believe! Obey God and obey the messenger, and render not your actions vain. S: O you who believe! obey God and obey the Messenger, and do not make your deeds of no effect.

047.034 Y: Those who reject God, and hinder (men) from the Path of God, then die rejecting God,- God will not forgive them. P: Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of God"Say: 'God gives you life, then causes you to die, then gathers you for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt.' But most people do not understand. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and on the Day the Hour of Judgment is established, those who follow falsehood will perish. Every sect will be called to its record: 'This Day you shall be recompensed for all that you did!' This Our Record speaks about you with truth: For We were wont to put on Record all that you did. Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy; that will be the achievement for all to see. But as to those who rejected God, it will be said: 'Were not Our Signs rehearsed to you? But you were arrogant and were a people given to sin!' And when it was said that the promise of God was true, and that the Hour—there was no doubt about its coming—you used to say, 'We know not what the Hour is: we only think it is an idea, and we have no firm assurance.' Then will appear to them the evil fruits of what they did, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at! It will also be said: 'This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! Your abode is the Fire, and no helpers have you!' This, because you used to take the Signs of God in jest, and the life of the world deceived you. Therefore, this day they shall not be taken out thence, nor shall they be received into Grace. Then Praise be to God, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord and Cherisher of all the Worlds! To Him be glory throughout the heavens and the earth: and He is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom!"And since they will not be guided by it, they say: This is an ancient lie; And those who disbelieve say concerning those who believe: If it had been a good, they would not have gone ahead of us therein. And as they do not seek to be rightly directed thereby, they say: It is an old lie. And before this, was the Book of Moses as a guide and a mercy: And this Book confirms it in the Arabic tongue; to admonish the unjust, and as Glad Tidings to those who do right. When before it there was the Scripture of Moses, an example and a mercy; and this is a confirming Scripture in the Arabic language, that it may warn those who do wrong and bring good tidings for the righteous. And before it the Book of Musa was a guide and a mercy: and this is a Book verifying it in the Arabic language that it may warn those who are unjust and as good news for the doers of good. Verily those who say, "Our Lord is God," and remain firm on that Path, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Lo! those who say: Our Lord is God, and thereafter walk aright, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. Surely those who say, Our Lord is God, then they continue on the right way, they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve. Such shall be Companions of the Gardens, dwelling therein for aye: a recompense for their good deeds. Such are rightful owners of the Garden, immortal therein, as a reward for what they used to do. These are the dwellers of the garden, abiding therein: a reward for what they did. We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: In pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth. The carrying of the child to his weaning is a period of thirty months. At length, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years, he says, "O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favour which Thou has bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and be gracious to me in my issue. Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow to Thee in Islam." And We have commended unto man kindness toward parents. His mother beareth him with reluctance, and bringeth him forth with reluctance, and the bearing of him and the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attaineth full strength and reacheth forty years, he saith: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for the favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and that I may do right acceptable unto Thee. And be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed. Lo! I have turned unto Thee repentant, and lo! I am of those who surrender unto Thee. And We have enjoined on man doing of good to his parents; with trouble did his mother bear him and with trouble did she bring him forth; and the bearing of him and the weaning of him was thirty months; until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years, he says: My Lord! grant me that I may give thanks for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do good which pleases Thee and do good to me in respect of my offspring; surely I turn to Thee, and surely I am of those who submit. Such are they from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and pass by their ill deeds: They shall be among the Companions of the Garden: a promise of truth, which was made to them in this life. Those are they from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook their evil deeds. They are among the owners of the Garden. This is the true promise which they were promised in the world. These are they from whom We accept the best of what they have done and pass over their evil deeds, among the dwellers of the garden; the promise of truth which they were promised. But there is one who says to his parents, "Fie on you! Do ye hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up, even though generations have passed before me without rising again?" And they two seek God's aid, and rebuke the son: "Woe to thee! Have faith! for the promise of God is true." But he says, "This is nothing but tales of the ancients!" And whoso saith unto his parents: Fie upon you both! Do ye threaten me that I shall be brought forth again when generations before me have passed away? And they twain cry unto God for help and say: Woe unto thee! Believe! Lo! the promise of God is true. But he saith: This is naught save fables of the men of old. And he who says to his parents: Fie on you! do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations have already passed away before me? And they both call for God's aid: Woe to you! believe, surely the promise of God is true. But he says: This is nothing but stories of the ancients. Such are they against whom is proved the sentence among the previous generations of jinns and men, that have passed away; for they will be utterly lost. Such are those on whom the Word concerning nations of the jinn and mankind which have passed away before them hath effect. Lo! they are the losers. These are they against whom the word has proved true among nations of the jinn and the men that have already passed away before them; surely they are losers. And to all are assigned degrees according to the deeds which they have done, and in order that God may recompense their deeds, and no injustice be done to them. And for all there will be ranks from what they do, that He may pay them for their deeds; and they will not be wronged. And for all are degrees according to what they did, and that He may pay them back fully their deeds and they shall not be wronged. And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, it will be said to them: "Ye received your good things in the life of the world, and ye took your pleasure out of them: but today shall ye be recompensed with a Penalty of humiliation: for that ye were arrogant on earth without just cause, and that ye ever transgressed." And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire it will be said: Ye squandered your good things in the life of the world and sought comfort therein. Now this day ye are rewarded with the doom of ignominy because ye were disdainful in the land without a right, and because ye used to transgress. And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire: You did away with your good things in your life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while, so today you shall be rewarded with the punishment of abasement because you were unjustly proud in the land and because you transgressed. Mention Hud one of 'Ad's own brethren: Behold, he warned his people about the winding Sand-tracts: but there have been warners before him and after him: "Worship ye none other than God: Truly I fear for you the Penalty of a Mighty Day." And make mention of the brother of A'ad when he warned his folk among the wind-curved sandhills - and verily warners came and went before and after him - saying: Serve none but God. Lo! I fear for you the doom of a tremendous Day. And mention the brother of Ad; when he warned his people in the sandy plains, and indeed warners came before him and after him saying Serve none but God; surely I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day. They said: "Hast thou come in order to turn us aside from our gods? Then bring upon us the calamity with which thou dost threaten us, if thou art telling the truth?" They said: Hast come to turn us away from our gods? Then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of the truthful. They said: Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods; then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones. He said: "The Knowledge of when it will come is only with God: I proclaim to you the mission on which I have been sent: But I see that ye are a people in ignorance!" He said: The knowledge is with God only. I convey unto you that wherewith I have been sent, but I see you are a folk that know not. He said: The knowledge is only with God, and I deliver to you the message with which I am sent, but I see you are a people who are ignorant. Then, when they saw the Penalty in the shape of a cloud traversing the sky, coming to meet their valleys, they said, "This cloud will give us rain!" "Nay, it is the Calamity ye were asking to be hastened! A wind wherein is a Grievous Penalty!" Then, when they beheld it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys, they said: Here is a cloud bringing us rain. Nay, but it is that which ye did seek to hasten, a wind wherein is painful torment, So when they saw it as a cloud appearing in the sky advancing towards their valleys, they said: This is a cloud which will give us rain. Nay! it is what you sought to hasten on, a blast of wind in which is a painful punishment, "Everything will it destroy by the command of its Lord!" Then by the morning they - nothing was to be seen but the ruins of their houses! Thus do We recompense those given to sin! Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord. And morning found them so that naught could be seen save their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty folk. Destroying everything by the command of its Lord, so they became such that naught could be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty people. And We had firmly established them in a prosperity and power which We have not given to you, and We had endowed them with faculties of hearing, seeing, heart and intellect: but of no profit to them were their faculties of hearing, sight, and heart and intellect, when they went on rejecting the Signs of God; and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at! And verily We had empowered them with that wherewith We have not empowered you, and had assigned them ears and eyes and hearts; but their ears and eyes and hearts availed them naught since they denied the revelations of God; and what they used to mock befell them. And certainly We had established them in what We have not established you in, and We had given them ears and eyes and hearts, but neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts availed them aught, since they denied the communications of God, and that which they mocked encompassed them. We destroyed aforetime populations round about you; and We have shown the Signs in various ways, that they may turn to Us. And verily We have destroyed townships round about you, and displayed for them Our revelation, that haply they might return. And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around you, and We repeat the communications that they might turn.h and then die disbelievers, God surely will not pardon them. S: Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from God's way, then they die while they are unbelievers, God will by no means forgive them.

047.035 Y: Be not weary and faint-hearted, crying for peace, when ye should be uppermost: for God is with you, and will never put you in loss for your (good) deeds. P: So do not falter and cry out for peace when ye (will be) the uppermost, and God is with you, and He will not grudge (the reward of) your actions. S: And be not slack so as to cry for peace and you have the upper hand, and God is with you, and He will not bring your deeds to naught.

047.036 Y: The life of this world is but play and amusement: and if ye believe and guard against Evil, He will grant you your recompense, and will not ask you (to give up) your possessions. P: The life of the world is but a sport and a pastime. And if ye believe and ward off (evil). He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your worldly wealth. S: The life of this world is only idle sport and play, and if you believe and guard (against evil) He will give you your rewards, and will not ask of you your possessions.

047.037 Y: If He were to ask you for all of them, and press you, ye would covetously withhold, and He would bring out all your ill-feeling. P: If He should ask it of you and importune you, ye would hoard it, and He would bring to light your (secret) hates. S: If He should ask you for it and urge you, you will be niggardly, and He will bring forth your malice.

047.038 Y: Behold, ye are those invited to spend (of your substance) in the Way of God: But among you are some that are niggardly. But any who are niggardly are so at the expense of their own souls. But God is free of all wants, and it is ye that are needy. If ye turn back (from the Path), He will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you! P: Lo! ye are those who are called to spend in the way of God, yet among you there are some who hoard. And as for him who hoardeth, he hoardeth only from his soul. And God is the Rich, and ye are the poor. And if ye turn away He will exchange you for some other folk, and they will not be the likes of you. S: Behold! you are those who are called upon to spend in God's way, but among you are those who are niggardly, and whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul; and God is Self-sufficient and you have need (of Him), and if you turn back He will bring in your place another people, then they will not be like you.

P: Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad), swear allegiance only unto God. The Hand of God is above their hands.

But God is well acquainted with all that ye do." P: Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee: Our possessions and our households occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us!

S: Those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind will say to you: Our property and our families kept us busy, so ask forgiveness for us. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: Then who can control anything for you from God if He intends to do you harm or if He intends to do you good; nay, God is Aware of what you do:

048.012 Y: "Nay, ye thought that the Messenger and the Believers would never return to their families; this seemed pleasing in your hearts, and ye conceived an evil thought, for ye are a people lost (in wickedness)."

They wish to change God's decree: Say: "Not thus will ye follow us: God has already declared (this) beforehand": then they will say, "But ye are jealous of us." Nay, but little do they understand (such things). P: Those who were left behind will say, when ye set forth to capture booty: Let us go with you. They fain would change the verdict of God.

048.025 Y: They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals, detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge, (God would have allowed you to force your way, but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they had been apart, We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment. P: These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of Worship, and debarred the offering from reaching its goal. And if it had not been for believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that God might bring into His mercy whom He will - If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment. S: It is they who disbelieved and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and (turned off) the offering withheld from arriving at its destined place; and were it not for the believing men and the believing women, whom, not having known, you might have trodden down, and thus something hateful might have afflicted you on their account without knowledge so that God may cause to enter into His mercy whomsoever He pleases; had they been widely separated one from another, We would surely have punished those who disbelieved from among them with a painful punishment.

048.026 Y: While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance,- God sent down His Tranquillity to his Messenger and to the Believers, and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And God has full knowledge of all things. P: When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry of the Age of Ignorance, then God sent down His peace of reassurance upon His messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self-restraint, for they were worthy of it and meet for it. And God is Aware of all things. S: When those who disbelieved harbored in their hearts (feelings of) disdain, the disdain of (the days of) ignorance, but God sent down His tranquillity on His Messenger and on the believers, and made them keep the word of guarding (against evil), and they were entitled to it and worthy of it; and God is Cognizant of all things.

048.027 Y: Truly did God fulfil the vision for His Messenger: ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque, if God wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not, and He granted, besides this, a speedy victory. P: God hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth. Ye shall indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if God will, secure, (having your hair) shaven and cut, not fearing. But He knoweth that which ye know not, and hath given you a near victory beforehand. S: Certainly God had shown to His Messenger the vision with truth: you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if God pleases, in security, (some) having their heads shaved and (others) having their hair cut, you shall not fear, but He knows what you do not know, so He brought about a near victory before that.

048.028 Y: It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is God for a Witness. P: He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion. And God sufficeth as a Witness. S: He it is Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it prevail over all the religions; and God is enough for a witness.

048.029 Y: Muhammad is the messenger of God; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from God and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. God has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward. P: Muhammad is the messenger of God. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from God and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sight of) them. God hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward. S: Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves; you will see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, seeking grace from God and pleasure;"o help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped as gods, besides God, as a means of access (to God)? Nay, they left them in the lurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention. Then why did those whom they had chosen for gods as a way of approach (unto God) not help them? Nay, but they did fail them utterly. And (all) that was their lie, and what they used to invent. Behold, We turned towards thee a company of jinns (quietly) listening to the Qur'an: when they stood in the presence thereof, they said, "Listen in silence!" When the (reading) was finished, they returned to their people, to warn (them of their sins). And when We inclined toward thee (Muhammad) certain of the jinn, who wished to hear the Qur'an and, when they were in its presence, said: Give ear! and, when it was finished, turned back to their people, warning. And when We turned towards you a party of the jinn who listened to the Quran; so when they came to it, they said: Be silent; then when it was finished, they turned back to their people warning (them). They said, "O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it: it guides (men) to the Truth and to a Straight Path." They said: O our people! Lo! we have heard a Scripture which hath been revealed after Moses, confirming that which was before it, guiding unto the truth and a right road. They said: O our people! we have listened to a Book revealed after Musa verifying that which is before it, guiding to the truth and to a right path: "O our people, hearken to the one who invites (you) to God, and believe in him: He will forgive you your faults, and deliver you from a Penalty Grievous." O our people! respond to God's summoner and believe in Him. He will forgive you some of your sins and guard you from a painful doom. O our people! accept the Divine caller and believe in Him, He will forgive you of your faults and protect you from a painful punishment. "If any does not hearken to the one who invites (us) to God, he cannot frustrate (God's Plan) on earth, and no protectors can he have besides God: such men (wander) in manifest error." And whoso respondeth not to God's summoner he can nowise escape in the earth, and he hath no protecting friends instead of Him. Such are in error manifest. And whoever does not accept the-Divine caller, he shall not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardians besides Him, these are in manifest error. See they not that God, Who created the heavens and the earth, and never wearied with their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yea, verily He has power over all things. Have they not seen that God, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead? Aye, He verily is Able to do all things. Have they not considered that God, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Aye! He has surely power over all things. And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (they will be asked,) "Is this not the Truth?" they will say, "Yea, by our Lord!" (One will say:) "Then taste ye the Penalty, for that ye were wont to deny (Truth)!" And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire (they will be asked): Is not this real? They will say: Yea, by our Lord. He will say: Then taste the doom for that ye disbelieved. And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire: Is it not true? They shall say: Aye! by our Lord! He will say: Then taste the punishment, because you disbelieved. Therefore patiently persevere, as did (all) messengers of inflexible purpose; and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them, (it will be) as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day. (Thine but) to proclaim the Message: but shall any be destroyed except those who transgress? Then have patience (O Muhammad) even as the stout of heart among the messengers (of old) had patience, and seek not to hasten on (the doom) for them. On the day when they see that which they are promised (it will seem to them) as though they had tarried but an hour of daylight. A clear message. Shall any be destroyed save evil-living folk? Therefore bear up patiently as did the messengers endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom). On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not tarried save an hour of the day. A sufficient exposition! Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people? - Chapter 47: MUHAMMAD (MUHAMMAD) Total Verses: 38 Revealed At: MADINA - In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Those who reject God and hinder (men) from the Path of God,- their deeds will God render astray (from their mark). Those who disbelieve and turn (men) from the way of God, He rendereth their actions vain. (As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from God's way, He shall render their works ineffective. But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and believe in the (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord,- He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition. And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed unto Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He riddeth them of their ill-deeds and improveth their state. And (as for) those who believe and do good, and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad, and it is the very truth from their Lord, He will remove their evil from them and improve their condition. This because those who reject God follow vanities, while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord: Thus does God set forth for men their lessons by similitudes. That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus God coineth their similitudes for mankind. That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers. Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been God's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of God,- He will never let their deeds be lost. Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if God willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of God, He rendereth not their actions vain. So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if God had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of God, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish. Soon will He guide them and improve their condition, He will guide them and improve their state, He will guide them and improve their condition. And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them. And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them. And cause them to enter the garden which He has made known to them. O ye who believe! If ye will aid (the cause of) God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly. O ye who believe! If ye help God, He will help you and will make your foothold firm. O you who believe! if you help (the cause of) God, He will help you and make firm your feet. But those who reject (God),- for them is destruction, and (God) will render their deeds astray (from their mark). And those who disbelieve, perdition is for them, and He will make their actions vain. And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective. That is because they hate the Revelation of God; so He has made their deeds fruitless. That is because they are averse to that which God hath revealed, therefore maketh He their actions fruitless. That is because they hated what God revealed, so He rendered their deeds null. Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of those before them (who did evil)? God brought utter destruction on them, and similar (fates await) those who reject God. Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? God wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof. Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them: God brought down destruction upon them, and the unbelievers shall have the like of it. That is because God is the Protector of those who believe, but those who reject God have no protector. That is because God is patron of those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no patron. That is because God is the Protector of those who believe, and because the unbelievers shall have no protector for them. Verily God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject God will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode. Lo! God will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; while those who disbelieve take their comfort in this life and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire is their habitation. Surely God will make those who believe and do good enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; and those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and etheir marks are in their faces because of the effect of prostration; that is their description in the Taurat and their description in the Injeel; like as seed-produce that puts forth its sprout, then strengthens it, so it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the unbelievers on account of them; God has promised those among them who believe and do good, forgiveness and a great reward.

P: And know that the messenger of God is among you. If he were to obey you in much of the government, ye would surely be in trouble; but God hath endeared the faith to you and hath beautified it in your hearts, and hath made disbelief and lewdness and rebellion hateful unto you.

S: And how many a town which was far more powerful than the town of yours which has driven you out: We destroyed them so there was no helper for them. 047.014 Y: Is then one who is on a clear (Path) from his Lord, no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing, and such as follow their own lusts? P: Is he who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord like those for whom the evil that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts? S: What! is he who has a clear argument from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fairseeming: and they follow their low desires. 047.015 Y: (Here is) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in it are rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces)? P: A similitude of the Garden which those who keep their duty (to God) are promised: Therein are rivers of water unpolluted, and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of clear-run honey; therein for them is every kind of fruit, with pardon from their Lord.

P: Among them are some who give ear unto thee (Muhammad) till, when they go forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge: What was that he said just now? Those are they whose hearts God hath sealed, and they follow their own lusts. S: And there are those of them who seek to listen to you, until when they go forth from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge: What was it that he said just now? These are they upon whose hearts God has set a seal and they follow their low desires. 047.017Y: But to those who receive Guidance, He increases the (light of)Guidance, and bestows on them their Piety and Restraint (from evil). P: While as for those who walk aright, He addeth to their guidance, and giveth them their protection (against evil). S: And (as for) those who follow the right direction, He increases them in guidance and gives them their guarding (against evil). 047.018 Y: Do they then only wait for the Hour,- that it should come on them of a sudden? But already have come some tokens thereof, and when it (actually) is on them, how can they benefit then by their admonition? P: Await they aught save the Hour, that it should come upon them unawares? And the beginnings thereof have already come. But how, when it hath come upon them, can they take their warning? S: Do they then wait for aught but the hour that it should come to them all of a sudden? Now indeed the tokens of it have (already) come, but how shall they have their reminder when it comes on them? 047.019 Y: Know, therefore, that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and for the men and women who believe: for God knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes. P: So know (O Muhammad) that there is no God save God, and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women. God knoweth (both) your place of turmoil and your place of rest. S: So know that there is no god but God, and, ask protection for your fault and for the believing men and the believing women; and God knows the place of your returning and the place of your abiding. 047.020 Y: Those who believe say, "Why is not a sura sent down (for us)?" But when a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein, thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with a look of one in swoon at the approach of death. But more fitting for them- P: And those who believe say: If only a surah were revealed! But when a decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto death. Therefor woe unto them! S: And those who believe say: Why has not a Chapter been revealed? But when a decisive Chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is a disease look to you with the look of one fainting because of death. Woe to them then! 047.021 Y: Were it to obey and say what is just, and when a matter is resolved on, it were best for them if they were true to God. P: Obedience and a civil word. Then, when the matter is determined, if they are loyal to God it will be well for them. S: Obedience and a gentle word (was proper); but when the affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to God it would certainly be better for them. 047.022 Y: Then, is it to be expected of you, if ye were put in authority, that ye will do mischief in the land, and break your ties of kith and kin? P: Would ye then, if ye were given the command, work corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship? S: But if you held command, you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship! 047.023 Y: Such are the men whom God has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight. P: Such are they whom God curseth so that He deafeneth them and maketh blind their eyes. S: Those it is whom God has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes. 047.024 Y: Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up by them? P: Will they then not meditate on the Qur'an, or are there locks on the hearts? S: Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Nay, on the hearts there are locks. 047.025 Y: Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them,- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes. P: Lo! those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, Satan hath seduced them, and He giveth them the rein. S: Surely (as for) those who return on their backs after that guidance has become manifest to them, the Shaitan has made it a light matter to them; and He gives them respite. 047.026Y: This, because they said to those who hate what God has revealed,"We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but God knows their(inner) secrets. P: That is because they say unto those who hate what God hath revealed: We will obey you in some matters; and God knoweth their secret talk. S: That is because they say to those who hate what God has revealed:We will obey you in some of the affairs; and God knows their secrets. 047.027 Y: But how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death, and smite their faces and their backs? P: Then how (will it be with them) when the angels gather them, smiting their faces and their backs! S: But how will it be when the angels cause them to die smiting their backs. 047.028Y: This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath ofGod, and they hated God's good pleasure; so He made their deeds ofno effect. P: That will be because they followed that which angereth God, and hated that which pleaseth Him. Therefor He hath made their actions vain. S: That is because they follow what is displeasing to God and are averse to His pleasure, therefore He has made null their deeds. 047.029 Y: Or do those in whose hearts is a disease, think that God will not bring to light all their rancour? P: Or do those in whose hearts is a disease deem that God will not bring to light their (secret) hates? S: Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that God will not bring forth their spite? 047.030 Y: Had We so wiled, We could have shown them up to thee, and thou shouldst have known them by their marks: but surely thou wilt know them by the tone of their speech! And God knows all that ye do. P: And if We would, We could show them unto thee (Muhammad) so that thou shouldst know them surely by their marks. And thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk. And God knoweth your deeds. S: And if We please We would have made you know them so that you would certainly have recognized them by their marks and most certainly you can recognize them by the intent of (their) speech; and God knows your deeds. 047.031 Y: And We shall try you until We test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience; and We shall try your reported (mettle). P: And verily We shall try you till We know those of you who strive hard (for the cause of God) and the steadfast, and till We test your record. S: And most certainly We will try you until We have known those among you who exert themselves hard, and the patient, and made your case manifest. 047.032 Y: Those who reject God, hinder (men) from the Path of God, and resist the Messenger, after Guidance has been clearly shown to them, will not injure God in the least, but He will make their deeds of no effect. P: Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of God and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, they hurt God not a jot, and He will make their actions fruitless. S: Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from God's way and oppose the Messenger after that guidance has become clear to them cannot harm God in any way, and He will make null their deeds. 047.033 Y: O ye who believe! Obey God, and obey the messenger, and make not vain your deeds! P: O ye who believe! Obey God and obey the messenger, and render not your actions vain. S: O you who believe! obey God and obey the Messenger, and do not make your deeds of no effect. 047.034 Y: Those who reject God, and hinder (men) from the Path of God, then die rejecting God,- God will not forgive them. P: Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of God and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, they hurt God not a jot, and He will make their actions fruitless."as a favour upon me: Nay, God has conferred a favour upon you that He has guided you to the faith, if ye be true and sincere." P: They make it a favour unto thee (Muhammad) that they have surrendered (unto Him). Say: Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me; but God doth confer a favour on you, inasmuch as He hath led you to the Faith, if ye are earnest. S: They think that they lay you under an obligation by becoming Muslims. Say: Lay me not under obligation by your Islam: rather God lays you under an obligation by guiding you to the faith if you are truthful.

049.018
Y: "Verily God knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth: and God Sees well all that ye do." P: Lo! God knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And God is Seer of what ye do. S: Surely God knows the unseen things of the heavens and the earth; and God sees what you do.

P: Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad), swear allegiance only unto God. The Hand of God is above their hands.

They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: "Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with God, if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? But God is well acquainted with all that ye do." P: Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee: Our possessions and our households occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us! They speak with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say: Who can avail you aught against God, if He intend you hurt or intend you profit? Nay, but God is ever Aware of what ye do. S: Those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind will say to you: Our property and our families kept us busy, so ask forgiveness for us. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: Then who can control anything for you from God if He intends to do you harm or if He intends to do you good; nay, God is Aware of what you do: 048.012 Y: "Nay, ye thought that the Messenger and the Believers would never return to their families; this seemed pleasing in your hearts, and ye conceived an evil thought, for ye are a people lost (in wickedness)." P: Nay, but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return to their own folk, and that was made fairseeming in your hearts, and ye did think an evil thought, and ye were worthless folk.

S: And God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases, and God is Forgiving, Merciful. 048.015 Y: Those who lagged behind (will say), when ye (are free to) march and take booty (in war): "Permit us to follow you." They wish to change God's decree: Say: "Not thus will ye follow us: God has already declared (this) beforehand": then they will say, "But ye are jealous of us." Nay, but little do they understand (such things). P: Those who were left behind will say, when ye set forth to capture booty: Let us go with you. They fain would change the verdict of God. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Ye shall not go with us. Thus hath God said beforehand. Then they will say: Ye are envious of us. Nay, but they understand not, save a little. S: Those who are left behind will say when you set forth for the gaining of acquisitions: Allow us (that) we may follow you. They"desire to change the world of God. Say: By no means shall you follow us; thus did God say before. But they will say: Nay! you are jealous of us. Nay! they do not understand but a little. 048.016 Y: Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind: 'Ye shall be summoned (to fight) against a people given to vehement war: then shall ye fight, or they shall submit. Then if ye show obedience, God will grant you a goodly reward, but if ye turn back as ye did before, He will punish you with a grievous Penalty.' P: Say unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind: Ye will be called against a folk of mighty prowess, to fight them until they surrender; and if ye obey, God will give you a fair reward; but if ye turn away as ye did turn away before, He will punish you with a painful doom. S: Say to those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind: You shall soon be invited (to fight) against a people possessing mighty prowess; you will fight against them until they submit; then if you obey, God will grant you a good reward; and if you turn back as you turned back before, He will punish you with a painful punishment. 048.017 Y: No blame is there on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys God and his Messenger,- (God) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back, (God) will punish him with a grievous Penalty. P: There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth God and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; and whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom. S: There is no harm in the blind, nor is there any harm in the lame, nor is there any harm in the sick (if they do not go forth); and whoever obeys God and His Messenger, He will cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and whoever turns back, He will punish him with a painful punishment. 048.018 Y: God's Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down Tranquillity to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory; P: God was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down peace of reassurance on them, and hath rewarded them with a near victory; S: Certainly God was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity on them and rewarded them with a near victory, 048.019 Y: And many gains will they acquire (besides): and God is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. P: And much booty that they will capture. God is ever Mighty, Wise. S: And many acquisitions which they will take; and God is Mighty, Wise. 048.020 Y: God has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire, and He has given you these beforehand; and He has restrained the hands of men from you; that it may be a Sign for the Believers, and that He may guide you to a Straight Path; P: God promiseth you much booty that ye will capture, and hath given you this in advance, and hath withheld men's hands from you, that it may be a token for the believers, and that He may guide you on a right path. S: God promised you many acquisitions which you will take, then He hastened on this one for you and held back the hands of men from you, and that it may be a sign for the believers and that He may guide you on a right path. 048.021 Y: And other gains (there are), which are not within your power, but which God has compassed: and God has power over all things. P: And other (gain), which ye have not been able to achieve, God will compass it, God is Able to do all things. S: And others which you have not yet been able to achieve God has surely encompassed them, and God has power over all things. 048.022 Y: If the Unbelievers should fight you, they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper. P: And if those who disbelieve join battle with you they will take to flight, and afterward they will find no protecting friend nor helper. S: And if those who disbelieve fight with you, they would certainly turn (their) backs, then they would not find any protector or a helper. 048.023 Y: (Such has been) the practice (approved) of God already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of God. P: It is the law of God which hath taken course aforetime. Thou wilt not find for the law of God aught of power to change. S: Such has been the course of God that has indeed run before, and you shall not find a change in God's course. 048.024 Y: And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka, after that He gave you the victory over them. And God sees well all that ye do. P: And He it is Who hath withheld men's hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after He had made you victors over them. God is Seer of what ye do. S: And He it is Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given you victory over them; and God is Seeing what you do. 048.025 Y: They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals, detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge, (God would have allowed you to force your way, but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they had been apart, We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment. P: These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of Worship, and debarred the offering from reaching its goal. And if it had not been for believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that God might bring into His mercy whom He will - If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment. S: It is they who disbelieved and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and (turned off) the offering withheld from arriving at its destined place; and were it not for the believing men and the believing women, whom, not having known, you might have trodden down, and thus something hateful might have afflicted you on their account without knowledge so that God may cause to enter into His mercy whomsoever He pleases; had they been widely separated one from another, We would surely have punished those who disbelieved from among them with a painful punishment. 048.026 Y: While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance,- God sent down His Tranquillity to his Messenger and to the Believers, and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And God has full knowledge of all things. P: When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry of the Age of Ignorance, then God sent down His peace of reassurance upon His messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self-restraint, for they were worthy of it and meet for it. And God is Aware of all things. S: When those who disbelieved harbored in their hearts (feelings of) disdain, the disdain of (the days of) ignorance, but God sent down His tranquillity on His Messenger and on the believers, and made them keep the word of guarding (against evil), and they were entitled to it and worthy of it; and God is Cognizant of all things. 048.027 Y: Truly did God fulfil the vision for His Messenger: ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque, if God wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not, and He granted, besides this, a speedy victory. P: God hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth. Ye shall indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if God will, secure, (having your hair) shaven and cut, not fearing. But He knoweth that which ye know not, and hath given you a near victory beforehand. S: Certainly God had shown to His Messenger the vision with truth: you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if God pleases, in security, (some) having their heads shaved and (others) having their hair cut, you shall not fear, but He knows what you do not know, so He brought about a near victory before that. 048.028 Y: It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is God for a Witness. P: He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion. And God sufficeth as a Witness. S: He it is Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it prevail over all the religions; and God is enough for a witness. 048.029 Y: Muhammad is the messenger of God; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from God and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. God has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward. P: Muhammad is the messenger of God. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from God and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sight of) them. God hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward. S: Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves; you will see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, seeking grace from God and pleasure."they wish and with Us is more yet.

It will be a Day when they will be tried and tested over the Fire!

051.014
"Taste ye your trial! This is what ye used to ask to be hastened!"

051.015
As to the Righteous, they will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs,

051.016
Taking joy in the things which their Lord gives them, because, before then, they lived a good life.

051.017
They were in the habit of sleeping but little by night,

051.018
And in the hour of early dawn, they were found praying for Forgiveness;

051.019
And in their wealth and possessions was remembered the right of the needy, him who asked, and him who for some reason was prevented from asking.

051.020
On the earth are signs for those of assured Faith,

051.021
As also in your own selves: Will ye not then see?

051.022
And in heaven is your Sustenance, as also that which ye are promised.

051.023
Then, by the Lord of heaven and earth, this is the very Truth, as much as the fact that ye can speak intelligently to each other.

051.024
Has the story reached thee, of the honoured guests of Abraham?

051.025
Behold, they entered his presence, and said: "Peace!" He said, "Peace!" and thought, "These seem unusual people."

051.026
Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf,

051.027
And placed it before them. He said, "Will ye not eat?"

051.028
When they did not eat, he conceived a fear of them. They said, "Fear not," and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.

051.029
But his wife came forward laughing aloud: she smote her forehead and said: "A barren old woman!"

051.030
They said, "Even so has thy Lord spoken: and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge."

051.031
(Abraham) said: "And what, O ye Messengers, is your errand now?"

051.032
They said, "We have been sent to a people deep in sin;

051.033
To bring on them a shower of stones of clay brimstone,

051.034
Marked as from thy Lord for those who trespass beyond bounds."

051.035
Then We evacuated those of the Believers who were there,

051.036
But We found not there any just Muslim persons except was blamable.

051.041
Y: And in the 'Ad (people) (was another Sign): Behold, We sent against them the devastating Wind: 
P: And in (the tribe of) A'ad (there is a portent) when we sent the fatal wind against them. 
S: And in Ad: When We sent upon them the destructive wind.

051.042
Y: It left nothing whatever that it came up against, but reduced it to ruin and rottenness. 
P: It spared naught that it reached, but made it (all) as dust. 
S: It did not leave aught on which it blew, but it made it like ashes.

051.043
Y: And in the Thamud (was another Sign): Behold, they were told, "Enjoy (your brief day) for a little while!" 
P: And in (the tribe of) Thamud (there is a portent) when it was told them: Take your ease awhile. 
S: And in Samood: When it was said to them: Enjoy yourselves for a while.

051.044
Y: But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord: So the stunning noise (of an earthquake) seized them, even while they were looking on. 
P: But they rebelled against their Lord's decree, and so the thunderbolt overtook them even while they gazed; 
S: But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord, so the rumbling overtook them while they saw.

051.045
Y: Then they could not even stand (on their feet), nor could they help themselves. 
P: And they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves. 
S: So they were not able to rise up, nor could they defend themselves.

051.046
Y: So were the People of Noah before them for they wickedly transgressed. 
P: And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they were licentious folk. 
S: And the people of Nuh before, surely they were a transgressing people.

051.047
Y: With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of space. 
P: We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof). 
S: And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and most surely We are the makers of things ample.

051.048
Y: And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread out! 
P: And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader (thereof)! 
S: And the earth, We have made it a wide extent; how well have We then spread (it) out.

051.049
Y: And of every thing We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction. 
P: And all things We have created by pairs, that haply ye may reflect. 
S: And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful.

051.050
Y: Hasten ye then (at once) to God: I am from Him a Warner to you, clear and open! 
P: Therefore flee unto God; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from him. 
S: Therefore fly to God, surely I am a plain warner to you from Him.

051.051
Y: And make not another an object of worship with God: I am from Him a Warner to you, clear and open! 
P: And set not any other god along with God; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from Him. 
S: And do not set up with God another god: surely I am a plain warner to you from Him.

051.052
Y: Similarly, no messenger came to the People before them, but they said (of him) in like manner, "A sorcerer, or one possessed"! 
P: Even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said: A wizard or a madman! 
S: Thus there did not come to those before them a messenger but they said: A magician or a mad man.

051.053
Y: Is this the legacy they have transmitted, one to another? Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds! 
P: Have they handed down (the saying) as an heirloom one unto another? Nay, but they are froward folk. 
S: Have they charged each other with this? Nay! they are an inordinate people.

051.054
Y: So turn away from them: not thine is the blame. 
P: So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), for thou art in no wise blameworthy, 
S: Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame;

051.055
Y: But teach (thy Message) for teaching benefits the Believers. 
P: And warn, for warning profiteth believers. 
S: And continue to remind, for surely the reminder profits the believers.

051.056
Y: I have only created jinns and men, that they may serve Me. 
P: I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me. 
S: And I have not created the jinn and the men except that they should serve Me.

051.057
Y: No Sustenance do I require of them, nor do I require that they should feed Me. 
P: I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me. 
S: I do not desire from them any sustenance and I do not desire that they should feed Me.

051.058
Y: For God is He Who gives (all) Sustenance,- Lord of Power,- Steadfast (for ever). 
P: Lo! God! He it is that giveth livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might. 
S: Surely God is the Bestower of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the Strong.

051.059
Y: For the wrong-doers, their portion is like unto the portion of their fellows (of earlier generations): then let them not ask Me to hasten (that portion)! 
P: And lo! for those who (now) do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil day (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (that day). 
S: So surely those who are unjust shall have a portion like the portion of their companions, therefore let them not ask Me to hasten on.

051.060
Y: Woe, then, to the Unbelievers, on account of that Day of theirs which they have been promised! 
P: And woe unto those who disbelieve, from (that) their day which they are promised. 
S: Therefore woe to those who disbelieve because of their day which they are threatened with."in one house: But We found there but one house of those surrendered (to God). And We left there a Sign for such as fear the Grievous Penalty. And in Moses (was another Sign): Behold, We sent him to Pharaoh, with authority manifest. But (Pharaoh) turned back with his Chiefs, and said, "A sorcerer, or one possessed!" So We took him and his forces, and threw them into the sea; and his was the blame. And in the 'Ad (people) (was another Sign): Behold, We sent against them the devastating Wind: It left nothing whatever that it came up against, but reduced it to ruin and rottenness. And in the Thamud (was another Sign): Behold, they were told, "Enjoy (your brief day) for a little while!" But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord: So the stunning noise (of an earthquake) seized them, even while they were looking on. Then they could not even stand (on their feet), nor could they help themselves. So were the People of Noah before them for they wickedly transgressed. With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of space. And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread out! And of every thing We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction. Hasten ye then (at once) to God: I am from Him a Warner to you, clear and open!

For God is He Who gives (all) Sustenance,- Lord of Power,- Steadfast (for ever). For the wrong-doers, their portion is like unto the portion of their fellows (of earlier generations): then let them not ask Me to hasten (that portion)! Woe, then, to the Unbelievers, on account of that Day of theirs which they have been promised!"them their offspring and We will not diminish to them aught of their work; every man is responsible for what he shall have wrought. And We shall bestow on them, of fruit and meat, anything they shall desire. And We provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire. They shall there exchange, one with another, a (loving) cup free of frivolity, free of all taint of ill. There they pass from hand to hand a cup wherein is neither vanity nor cause of sin. They shall pass therein from one to another a cup wherein there shall be nothing vain nor any sin. Round about them will serve, (devoted) to them, young male servants (handsome) as Pearls well-guarded. And there go round, waiting on them menservants of their own, as they were hidden pearls. And round them shall go boys of theirs as if they were hidden pearls. They will advance to each other, engaging in mutual enquiry. And some of them draw near unto others, questioning, And some of them shall advance towards others questioning each other. They will say: "Aforetime, we were not without fear for the sake of our people." Saying: Lo! of old, when we were with our families, we were ever anxious; Saying: Surely we feared before on account of our families: "But God has been good to us, and has delivered us from the Penalty of the Scorching Wind." But God hath been gracious unto us and hath preserved us from the torment of the breath of Fire. But God has been gracious to us and He has saved us from the punishment of the hot wind: "Truly, we did call unto Him from of old: truly it is He, the Beneficent, the Merciful!" Lo! we used to pray unto Him of old. Lo! He is the Benign, the Merciful. Surely we called upon Him before: Surely He is the Benign, the Merciful. Therefore proclaim thou the praises (of thy Lord): for by the Grace of thy Lord, thou art no (vulgar) soothsayer, nor art thou one possessed. Therefore warn (men, O Muhammad). By the grace of God thou art neither soothsayer nor madman. Therefore continue to remind, for by the grace of your Lord, you are not a soothsayer, or a madman. Or do they say:- "A Poet! we await for him some calamity (hatched) by Time!" Or say they: (he is) a poet, (one) for whom we may expect the accident of time? Or do they say: A poet, we wait for him the evil accidents of time. Say thou: "Await ye!- I too will wait along with you!" Say (unto them): Except (your fill)! Lo! I am with you among the expectant. Say: Wait, for surely I too with you am of those who wait. Is it that their faculties of understanding urge them to this, or are they but a people transgressing beyond bounds? Do their minds command them to do this, or are they an outrageous folk? Nay! do their understandings bid them this? Or are they an inordinate people? Or do they say, "He fabricated the (Message)"? Nay, they have no faith! Or say they: He hath invented it? Nay, but they will not believe! Or do they say: He has forged it. Nay! they do not believe. Let them then produce a recital like unto it,- If (it be) they speak the truth! Then let them produce speech the like thereof, if they are truthful. Then let them bring an announcement like it if they are truthful. Were they created of nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or were they created out of naught? Or are they the creators? Or were they created without there being anything, or are they the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no firm belief. Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they are sure of nothing! Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay! they have no certainty. Or are the Treasures of thy Lord with them, or are they the managers (of affairs)? Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord? Or have they been given charge (thereof)? Or have they the treasures of your Lord with them? Or have they been set in absolute authority? Or have they a ladder, by which they can (climb up to heaven and) listen (to its secrets)? Then let (such a) listener of theirs produce a manifest proof. Or have they any stairway (unto heaven) by means of which they overhear (decrees). Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest! Or have they the means by which they listen? Then let their listener bring a clear authority. Or has He only daughters and ye have sons? Or hath He daughters whereas ye have sons? Or has He daughters while you have sons? Or is it that thou dost ask for a reward, so that they are burdened with a load of debt?- Or askest thou (Muhammad) a fee from them so that they are plunged in debt? Or do you ask them for a reward, so that they are overburdened by a debt? Or that the Unseen in it their hands, and they write it down? Or possess they the Unseen so that they can write (it) down? Or have they the unseen so that they write (it) down? Or do they intend a plot (against thee)? But those who defy God are themselves involved in a Plot! Or seek they to ensnare (the messenger)? But those who disbelieve, they are the ensnared! Or do they desire a war? But those who disbelieve shall be the vanquished ones in war. Or have they a god other than God? Exalted is God far above the things they associate with Him! Or have they any god beside God? Glorified be God from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! Or have they a god other than God? Glory be to God from what they set up (with Him). Were they to see a piece of the sky falling (on them), they would (only) say: "Clouds gathered in heaps!" And if they were to see a fragment of the heaven falling, they would say: A heap of clouds. And if they should see a portion of the heaven coming down, they would say: Piled up clouds. So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs, wherein they shall (perforce) swoon (with terror),- Then let them be (O Muhammad), till they meet their day, in which they will be thunder-stricken, Leave them then till they meet that day of theirs wherein they shall be made to swoon (with terror): The Day when their plotting will avail them nothing and no help shall be given them. A day in which their guile will naught avail them, nor will they be helped. The day on which their struggle shall not avail them aught, nor shall they be helped. And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment besides this: But most of them understand not. And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a punishment beyond that. But most of them know not. And surely those who are unjust shall have a punishment besides that (in the world), but most of them do not know. Now await in patience the command of thy Lord: for verily thou art in Our eyes: and celebrate the praises of thy Lord the while thou standest forth, So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord when thou uprisest, And wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, for surely you are before Our eyes, and sing the praise of your Lord when you rise; And for part of the night also praise thou Him,- and at the retreat of the stars! And in the night-time also hymn His praise, and at the setting of the stars. And in the night, give Him glory too, and at the setting of the stars.What! for you the male sex, and for Him, the female?
Are yours the males and His the females?
What! for you the males and for Him the females!

Behold, such would be indeed a division most unfair!
That indeed were an unfair division!
This indeed is an unjust division!

These are nothing but names which ye have devised,- ye and your fathers,- for which God has sent down no authority (whatever). They follow nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire!- Even though there has already come to them Guidance from their Lord!
They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which God hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they) themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them.
They are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers; God has not sent for them any authority. They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which (their) souls incline to; and certainly the guidance has come to them from their Lord.

Nay, shall man have (just) anything he hankers after?
Or shall man have what he coveteth?
Or shall man have what he wishes?

But it is to God that the End and the Beginning (of all things) belong.
But unto God belongeth the after (life), and the former.
Nay! for God is the hereafter and the former (life).

How many-so-ever be the angels in the heavens, their intercession will avail nothing except after God has given leave for whom He pleases and that he is acceptable to Him.
And how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession availeth naught save after God giveth leave to whom He chooseth and accepteth.
And how many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession does not avail at all except after God has given permission to whom He pleases and chooses.

Those who believe not in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names.
Lo! it is those who disbelieve in the Hereafter who name the angels with the names of females.
Most surely they who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels with female names.

But they have no knowledge therein. They follow nothing but conjecture; and conjecture avails nothing against Truth.
And they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but a guess, and lo! a guess can never take the place of the truth.
And they have no knowledge of it; they do not follow anything but conjecture, and surely conjecture does not avail against the truth at all.

Therefore shun those who turn away from Our Message and desire nothing but the life of this world.
Then withdraw (O Muhammad) from him who fleeth from Our remembrance and desireth but the life of the world.
Therefore turn aside from him who turns his back upon Our reminder and does not desire anything but this world's life.

That is as far as knowledge will reach them. Verily thy Lord knoweth best those who stray from His Path, and He knoweth best those who receive guidance.
Such is their sum of knowledge. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth, and He is Best Aware of him whom goeth right.
That is their goal of knowledge; surely your Lord knows best him who goes astray from His path and He knows best him who follows the right direction.

Yea, to God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that He rewards those who do evil, according to their deeds, and He rewards those who do good, with what is best.
And unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good with goodness.
And God's is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness.

Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only (falling into) small faults,- verily thy Lord is ample in forgiveness. He knows you well when He brings you out of the earth, and when ye are hidden in your mothers' wombs. Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards against evil.
Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled offences - (for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you (from the time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of your mothers. Therefore ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is Best Aware of him who wardeth off (evil).
Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the indecencies but the passing idea; surely your Lord is liberal in forgiving. He knows you best when He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the wombs of your mothers; therefore do not attribute purity to your souls; He knows him best who guards (against evil).

Seest thou one who turns back,
Didst thou (O Muhammad) observe him who turned away,
Have you then seen him who turns his back?

Gives a little, then hardens (his heart)?
And gave a little, then was grudging?
And gives a little and (then) withholds.

What! Has he knowledge of the Unseen so that he can see?
Hath he knowledge of the Unseen so that he seeth?
Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see?

Nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the Books of Moses-
Or hath he not had news of what is in the books of Moses
Or, has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Musa?

And of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements?-
And Abraham who paid his debt:
And (of) Ibrahim who fulfilled (the commandments):

Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another;
That no laden one shall bear another's load,
That no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another-

That man can have nothing but what he strives for;
And that man hath only that for which he maketh effort,
And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for-

That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight:
And that his effort will be seen.
And that his striving shall soon be seen-

Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete;
And afterward he will be repaid for it with fullest payment;
Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward-

That to thy Lord is the final Goal;
And that thy Lord, He is the goal;
And that to your Lord is the goal-

That it is He Who granteth Laughter and Tears;
And that He it is who maketh laugh, and maketh weep,
And that He it is Who makes (men) laugh and makes (them) weep;

That it is He Who granteth Death and Life;
And that He it is Who giveth death and giveth life;
And that He it is Who causes death and gives life-

That He did create in pairs,- male and female,
And that He createth the two spouses, the male and the female,
And that He created pairs, the male and the female

From a seed when lodged (in its place);
From a drop (of seed) when it is poured forth;
From the small seed when it is adapted

That He hath promised a Second Creation (Raising of the Dead);
And that He hath ordained the second bringing forth;
And that on Him is the bringing forth a second time;

That it is He Who giveth wealth and satisfaction;
And that He it is Who enricheth and contenteth;
And that He it is Who enriches and gives to hold;

That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star);
And that He it is Who is the Lord of Sirius;
And that He is the Lord of the Sirius;

And that it is He Who destroyed the (powerful) ancient 'Ad (people),
And that He destroyed the former (tribe of) A'ad,
And that He did destroy the Ad of old

And the Thamud nor gave them a lease of perpetual life.
And (the tribe of) Thamud He spared not;
And Samood, so He spared not

And before them, the people of Noah, for that they were (all) most unjust and most insolent transgressors,
And the folk of Noah aforetime, Lo! they were more unjust and more rebellious;
And the people of Nuh before; surely they were most unjust and inordinate;

And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah).
And Al-Mu'tafikah He destroyed
And the overthrown cities did He overthrow,

So that (ruins unknown) have covered them up.
So that there covered them that which did cover.
So there covered them that which covered.

Then which of the gifts of thy Lord, (O man,) wilt thou dispute about?
Concerning which then, of the bounties of thy Lord, canst thou dispute?
Which of your Lord's benefits will you then dispute about?

This is a Warner, of the (series of) Warners of old!
This is a warner of the warners of old.
This is a warner of the warners of old.

The (Judgment) ever approaching draws nigh:
The threatened Hour is nigh.
The near event draws nigh.

No (soul) but God can lay it bare.
None beside God can disclose it.
There shall be none besides God to remove it.

Do ye then wonder at this recital?
Marvel ye then at this statement,
Do you then wonder at this announcement?

And will ye laugh and not weep,-
And laugh and not weep,
And will you laugh and not weep?

Wasting your time in vanities?
While ye amuse yourselves?
While you are indulging in varieties.

But fall ye down in prostration to God, and adore (Him)!
Rather prostrate yourselves before God and serve Him.
So make obeisance to God and serve (Him).What! For you the male sex, and for Him, the female? Behold, such would be indeed a division most unfair! These are nothing but names which you have devised, you and your fathers, for which God has sent down no authority. They follow nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire, even though there has already come to them guidance from their Lord! Shall man have anything he hankers after? But it is to God that the End and the Beginning of all things belong. How many angels are in the heavens whose intercession will avail nothing except after God has given leave for whom He pleases and that he is acceptable to Him. Those who believe not in the Hereafter name the angels with female names. But they have no knowledge therein. They follow nothing but conjecture; and conjecture avails nothing against Truth. Therefore shun those who turn away from Our Message and desire nothing but the life of this world. That is as far as knowledge will reach them. Verily, your Lord knows best those who stray from His Path, and He knows best those who receive guidance. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that He rewards those who do evil, according to their deeds, and He rewards those who do good, with what is best. Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only falling into small faults, verily your Lord is ample in forgiveness. He knows you well when He brings you out of the earth, and when you are hidden in your mothers' wombs. Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards against evil. Seest thou one who turns back, gives a little, then hardens his heart? Has he knowledge of the Unseen so that he can see? Nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the Books of Moses and of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements? Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another; that man can have nothing but what he strives for; that the fruit of his striving will soon come in sight: then will he be rewarded with a reward complete; that to your Lord is the final Goal; that it is He Who grants Laughter and Tears; that it is He Who grants Death and Life; that He did create in pairs, male and female, from a seed when lodged in its place; that He has promised a Second Creation (Raising of the Dead); that it is He Who gives wealth and satisfaction; that He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star); that it is He Who destroyed the powerful ancient 'Ad people, and the Thamud nor gave them a lease of perpetual life. And before them, the people of Noah, for they were most unjust and most insolent transgressors, and He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah). So that ruins unknown have covered them up. Then which of the gifts of your Lord, O man, will you dispute about? This is a Warner, of the series of Warners of old! The Judgment ever approaching draws nigh: no soul but God can lay it bare. Do you then wonder at this recital? And will you laugh and not weep, wasting your time in vanities? But fall down in prostration to God, and adore Him!nings avail not. Consummate wisdom but warnings do not avail; therefore, (O Prophet,) turn away from them. The Day that the Caller will call them to a terrible affair, they will come forth, their eyes humbled, from their graves, like locusts scattered abroad. Hastening, with eyes transfixed, towards the Caller, the Unbelievers will say, "Hard is this Day!" Before them, the People of Noah rejected their messenger, saying, "Here is one possessed!" and he was driven out. Then he called on his Lord, "I am one overcome: do Thou then help me!" So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth and caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met to the extent decreed. We bore him on an Ark made of broad planks and caulked with palm-fibre, floating under Our eyes as a recompense to one who had been rejected. We have left this as a Sign; then is there any that will receive admonition? But how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning? We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will receive admonition? The 'Ad people also rejected Truth; We sent against them a furious wind on a Day of violent Disaster, plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up. How terrible was My Penalty and My Warning! The Thamud also rejected their Warners, saying, "What! a man! a solitary one from among ourselves! shall we follow such a one? Truly should we then be straying in mind, and mad!" They called their companion, and he took a sword in hand and hamstrung the she-camel. How terrible was My Penalty and My Warning! We sent against them a single Mighty Blast, and they became like the dry stubble used by one who pens cattle. We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will receive admonition? The people of Lut rejected his warning. We sent against them a violent Tornado with showers of stones, except Lut's household; them We delivered by early Dawn, as a Grace from Us. Thus do We reward those who give thanks. Lut warned them of Our Punishment, but they disputed about the Warning. They even sought to snatch away his guests from him, but We blinded their eyes. Early on the morrow, an abiding Punishment seized them. "So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning." We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will receive admonition? To the People of Pharaoh, too, came Warners from God. They rejected all Our Signs; We seized them with such Penalty as comes from One Exalted in Power, able to carry out His Will. Are your Unbelievers, O Quraish, better than they? Or have ye an immunity in the Sacred Books? Or do they say, "We acting together can defend ourselves"? Soon will their multitude be put to flight, and they will show their backs. Nay, the Hour of Judgment is the time promised them for their full recompense, and that Hour will be most grievous and most bitter.Truly those in sin are the ones straying in mind, and mad. The guilty are in error and distress. The Day they will be dragged through the Fire on their faces, they will hear: "Taste the touch of Hell!" On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces, it is said unto them: Feel the touch of hell. Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure. We have created everything by measure. And Our Command is but a single Act, like the twinkling of an eye. Our commandment is but one, as the twinkling of an eye. And oft in the past, have We destroyed gangs like unto you: then is there any that will receive admonition? We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that remembereth? We have already destroyed the likes of you, but is there anyone who will mind? All that they do is noted in their Books of Deeds. Everything they did is in the scriptures. Everything they have done is in the writings. Every matter, small and great, is on record. Every small and great thing is recorded. As to the Righteous, they will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers. The righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers. Those who guard against evil shall be in gardens and rivers. In an Assembly of Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Omnipotent. Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King. In the seat of honor with a most Powerful King.

He created man from sounding clay like unto pottery. He created man of clay like the potter's. He created man from dry clay like earthen vessels. And He created jinns from fire free of smoke.

Between them is a Barrier which they do not transgress. There is a barrier between them. They encroach not one upon the other. Between them is a barrier which they cannot pass. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny? Out of them come Pearls and Coral. There cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral-stone. There come forth from them pearls, both large and small. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

His are the ships displayed upon the sea, like banners. His are the ships reared aloft in the sea like mountains. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny? All that is on earth will perish. Everyone that is thereon will pass away. Everyone on it must pass away. But will abide for ever the Face of thy Lord, full of Majesty, Bounty and Honour. There remaineth but the Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. There will endure for ever the person of your Lord, the Lord of glory and honor. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny? Of Him seeks its need every creature in the heavens and on earth: every day in new Splendour doth He shine! All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat Him. Every day He exerciseth universal power. All those who are in the heavens and the earth ask of Him; every moment He is in a state of glory. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?

If it be ye can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, pass ye! not without authority shall ye be able to pass! O company of jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate all regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate them! Ye will never penetrate them save with Our sanction. O assembly of the jinn and the men! If you are able to pass through the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass through; you cannot pass through but with authority. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny? On you will be sent a flame of fire to burn and a smoke to choke: no defence will ye have. There will be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not escape. The flames of fire and smoke will be sent on you two, then you will not be able to defend yourselves. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny? When the sky is rent asunder, and it becomes red like ointment.

This is the hell which the guilty called a lie. In its midst and in the midst of boiling hot water will they wander round! They go circling round between it and fierce, boiling water. Round about shall they go between it and hot, boiling water. Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny? But for such as fear the time when they will stand before the Judgment Seat of their Lord, there will be two Gardens. But for him who feareth the standing before his Lord there are two gardens. And for him who fears in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness.

Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only (falling into) small faults,- verily thy Lord is ample in forgiveness. He knows you well when He brings you out of the earth, and when ye are hidden in your mothers' wombs. Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards against evil.
Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled offences - (for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you (from the time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of your mothers. Therefore ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is Best Aware of him who wardeth off (evil).
Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the indecencies but the passing idea; surely your Lord is liberal in forgiving. He knows you best when He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the wombs of your mothers; therefore do not attribute purity to your souls; He knows him best who guards (against evil).

Seest thou one who turns back,
Didst thou (O Muhammad) observe him who turned away,

nings avail not. Consummate wisdom but warnings do not avail; 054.006 Therefore, (O Prophet,) turn away from them. The Day that the Caller will call (them) to a terrible affair, So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the day when the Summoner summoneth unto a painful thing. So turn (your) back on them (for) the day when the inviter shall invite them to a hard task, 054.007 They will come forth,- their eyes humbled - from (their) graves, (torpid) like locusts scattered abroad, With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts spread abroad, Their eyes cast down, going forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts, 054.008 Hastening, with eyes transfixed, towards the Caller!- "Hard is this Day!", the Unbelievers will say. Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day. Hastening to the inviter. The unbelievers shall say: This is a hard day. 054.009 Before them the People of Noah rejected (their messenger): they rejected Our servant, and said, "Here is one possessed!", and he was driven out. The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A madman; and he was repulsed. Before them the people of Nuh rejected, so they rejected Our servant and called (him) mad, and he was driven away. 054.010 Then he called on his Lord: "I am one overcome: do Thou then help (me)!" So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help. Therefore he called upon his Lord: I am overcome, come Thou then to help. 054.011 So We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring forth. Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water So We opened the gates of the cloud with water pouring 054.012 And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met (and rose) to the extent decreed. And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a predestined purpose. And We made water to flow forth in the land in springs, so the water gathered together according to a measure already ordained. 054.013 But We bore him on an (Ark) made of broad planks and caulked with palm-fibre: And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails, And We bore him on that which was made of planks and nails 054.014 She floats under our eyes (and care): a recompense to one who had been rejected (with scorn)! That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight, as a reward for him who was rejected. Sailing, before Our eyes, a reward for him who was denied. 054.015 And We have left this as a Sign (for all time): then is there any that will receive admonition? And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth? And certainly We left it as a sign, but is there anyone who 054.016 But how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning? Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! How (great) was then My punishment and My warning! 054.017 And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth? And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will mind? 054.018 The 'Ad (people) (too) rejected (Truth): then how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning? (The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings. Ad treated (the truth) as a lie, so how (great) was My punishment and My warning! 054.019 For We sent against them a furious wind, on a Day of violent Disaster, Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity, Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of bitter ill-luck 054.020 Plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up (from the ground). Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees. Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palm-trees torn up. 054.021 Yea, how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning! Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! How (great) was then My punishment and My warning! 054.022 But We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth? And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will mind? 054.023 The Thamud (also) rejected (their) Warners. (The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings Samood rejected the warning. 054.024 For they said: "What! a man! a solitary one from among ourselves! shall we follow such a one? Truly should we then be straying in mind, and mad!" For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow? Then indeed we should fall into error and madness. So they said: What! a single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely we shall in that case be in sure error and distress: 054.025 "Is it that the Message is sent to him, of all people amongst us? Nay, he is a liar, an insolent one!" Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us? Nay, but he is a rash liar. Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among us? Nay! he is an insolent liar! 054.026 Ah! they will know on the morrow, which is the liar, the insolent one! (Unto their warner it was said): To-morrow they will know who is the rash liar. Tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one. 054.027 For We will send the she-camel by way of trial for them. So watch them, (O Salih), and possess thyself in patience! Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have patience; Surely We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them; therefore watch them and have patience. 054.028 And tell them that the water is to be divided between them: Each one's right to drink being brought forward (by suitable turns). And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them. Every drinking will be witnessed. And inform them that the water is shared between them; every share of the water shall be regulated. 054.029 But they called to their companion, and he took a sword in hand, and hamstrung (her). But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung (her). But they called their companion, so he took (the sword) and slew (her). 054.030 Ah! how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning! Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! How (great) was then My punishment and My warning! 054.031 For We sent against them a single Mighty Blast, and they became like the dry stubble used by one who pens cattle. Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold. Surely We sent upon them a single cry, so they were like the dry fragments of trees which the maker of an enclosure collects. 054.032 And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth? And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will mind? 054.033 The people of Lut rejected (his) warning. The folk of Lot rejected warnings. The people of Lut treated the warning as a lie. 054.034 We sent against them a violent Tornado with showers of stones, (which destroyed them), except Lut's household: them We delivered by early Dawn,- Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them (all) save the family of Lot, whom We rescued in the last watch of the night, Surely We sent upon them a stonestorm, except Lut's followers; We saved them a little before daybreak, 054.035 As a Grace from Us: thus do We reward those who give thanks. As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks. A favor from Us; thus do We reward him who gives thanks. 054.036 And (Lut) did warn them of Our Punishment, but they disputed about the Warning. And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the warnings. And certainly he warned them of Our violent seizure, but they obstinately disputed the warning. 054.037 And they even sought to snatch away his guests from him, but We blinded their eyes. (They heard:) "Now taste ye My Wrath and My Warning." They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their eyes (and said): Taste now My punishment after My warnings! And certainly they endeavored to turn him from his guests, but We blinded their eyes; so taste My chastisement and My warning. 054.038 Early on the morrow an abiding Punishment seized them: And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning. And certainly a lasting chastisement overtook them in the morning. 054.039 "So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning." Now taste My punishment after My warnings! So taste My chastisement and My warning. 054.040 And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth? And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will mind? 054.041 To the People of Pharaoh, too, aforetime, came Warners (from God). And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh And certainly the warning came to Firon's people. 054.042 The (people) rejected all Our Signs; but We seized them with such Penalty (as comes) from One Exalted in Power, able to carry out His Will. Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful. They rejected all Our communications, so We overtook them after the manner of a Mighty, Powerful One. 054.043 Are your Unbelievers, (O Quraish), better than they? Or have ye an immunity in the Sacred Books? Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the scriptures? Are the unbelievers of yours better than these, or is there an exemption for you in the scriptures? 054.044 Or do they say: "We acting together can defend ourselves"? Or say they: We are a host victorious? Or do they say: We are a host allied together to help each other? 054.045 Soon will their multitude be put to flight, and they will show their backs. The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee. Soon shall the hosts be routed, and they shall turn (their) backs. 054.046 Nay, the Hour (of Judgment) is the time promised them (for their full recompense): And that Hour will be most grievous and most bitter.

And those who believe in God and His messengers- they are"the Sincere (lovers of Truth), and the witnesses (who testify), in the eyes of their Lord: They shall have their Reward and their Light. But those who reject God and deny Our Signs,- they are the Companions of Hell-Fire. And those who believe in God and His messengers, they are the loyal, and the martyrs are with their Lord; they have their reward and their light; while as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hell-fire. And (as for) those who believe in God and His messengers, these it is that are the truthful and the faithful ones in the sight of their Lord: they shall have their reward and their light, and (as for) those who disbelieve and reject Our communications, these are the inmates of the hell. Know ye (all), that the life of this world is but play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting and multiplying, (in rivalry) among yourselves, riches and children. Here is a similitude: How rain and the growth which it brings forth, delight (the hearts of) the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a Penalty severe (for the devotees of wrong). And Forgiveness from God and (His) Good Pleasure (for the devotees of God). And what is the life of this world, but goods and chattels of deception? Know that the life of the world is only play, and idle talk, and pageantry, and boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children; as the likeness of vegetation after rain, whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman, but afterward it drieth up and thou seest it turning yellow, then it becometh straw. And in the Hereafter there is grievous punishment, and (also) forgiveness from God and His good pleasure, whereas the life of the world is but matter of illusion. Know that this world's life is only sport and play and gaiety and boasting among yourselves, and a vying in the multiplication of wealth and children, like the rain, whose causing the vegetation to grow, pleases the husbandmen, then it withers away so that you will see it become yellow, then it becomes dried up and broken down; and in the hereafter is a severe chastisement and (also) forgiveness from God and (His) pleasure; and this world's life is naught but means of deception. Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers: that is the Grace of God, which He bestows on whom he pleases: and God is the Lord of Grace abounding. Race one with another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whereof the breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth, which is in store for those who believe in God and His messengers. Such is the bounty of God, which He bestoweth upon whom He will, and God is of Infinite Bounty. Hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden the extensiveness of which is as the extensiveness of the heaven and the earth; it is prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers; that is the grace of God: He gives it to whom He pleases, and God is the Lord of mighty grace. No misfortune can happen on earth or in your souls but is recorded in a decree before We bring it into existence: That is truly easy for God: Naught of disaster befalleth in the earth or in yourselves but it is in a Book before we bring it into being - Lo! that is easy for God - No evil befalls on the earth nor in your own souls, but it is in a book before We bring it into existence; surely that is easy to God: In order that ye may not despair over matters that pass you by, nor exult over favours bestowed upon you. For God loveth not any vainglorious boaster,- That ye grieve not for the sake of that which hath escaped you, nor yet exult because of that which hath been given. God loveth not all prideful boasters, So that you may not grieve for what has escaped you, nor be exultant at what He has given you; and God does not love any arrogant boaster: Such persons as are covetous and commend covetousness to men. And if any turn back (from God's Way), verily God is Free of all Needs, Worthy of all Praise. Who hoard and who enjoin upon the people avarice. And whosoever turneth away, still God is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. Those who are niggardly and enjoin niggardliness on men; and whoever turns back, then surely God is He Who is the Self-sufficient, the Praised. We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong), that men may stand forth in justice; and We sent down Iron, in which is (material for) mighty war, as well as many benefits for mankind, that God may test who it is that will help, Unseen, Him and His messengers: For God is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might (and able to enforce His Will). We verily sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance, that mankind may observe right measure; and He revealed iron, wherein is mighty power and (many) uses for mankind, and that God may know him who helpeth Him and His messengers, though unseen. Lo! God is Strong, Almighty. Certainly We sent Our messengers with clear arguments, and sent down with them the Book and the balance that men may conduct themselves with equity; and We have made the iron, wherein is great violence and advantages to men, and that God may know who helps Him and His messengers in the secret; surely God is Strong, Mighty. And We sent Noah and Abraham, and established in their line Prophethood and Revelation: and some of them were on right guidance. But many of them became rebellious transgressors. And We verily sent Noah and Abraham and placed the Prophethood and the Scripture among their seed, and among them there is he who goeth right, but many of them are evil-livers. And certainly We sent Nuh and Ibrahim and We gave to their offspring the (gift of) prophecy and the Book; so there are among them those who go aright, and most of them are transgressors. Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers: We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel; and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of God; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed, on those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors. Then We caused Our messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow, and gave him the Gospel, and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. But monasticism they invented - We ordained it not for them - only seeking God's pleasure, and they observed it not with right observance. So We give those of them who believe their reward, but many of them are evil-livers. Then We made Our messengers to follow in their footsteps, and We sent Isa son of Marium afterwards, and We gave him the Injeel, and We put in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy; and (as for) monkery, they innovated it We did not prescribe it to them only to seek God's pleasure, but they did not observe it with its due observance; so We gave to those of them who believed their reward, and most of them are transgressors. O ye that believe! Fear God, and believe in His Messenger, and He will bestow on you a double portion of His Mercy: He will provide for you a Light by which ye shall walk (straight in your path), and He will forgive you (your past): for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to God and put faith in His messenger. He will give you twofold of His mercy and will appoint for you a light wherein ye shall walk, and will forgive you. God is Forgiving, Merciful; O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) God and believe in His Messenger: He will give you two portions of His mercy, and make for you a light with which you will walk, and forgive you, and God is Forgiving, Merciful; That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever over the Grace of God, that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand, to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. For God is the Lord of Grace abounding. That the People of the Scripture may know that they control naught of the bounty of God, but that the bounty is in God's hand to give to whom He will. And God is of Infinite Bounty. So that the followers of the Book may know that they do not control aught of the grace of God, and that grace is in God's hand, He gives it to whom He pleases; and God is the Lord of mighty grace.the Sincere (lovers of Truth), and the witnesses (who testify), in the eyes of their Lord: They shall have their Reward and their Light. But those who reject God and deny Our Signs,- they are the Companions of Hell-Fire. And those who believe in God and His messengers, they are the loyal, and the martyrs are with their Lord; they have their reward and their light; while as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hell-fire. And (as for) those who believe in God and His messengers, these it is that are the truthful and the faithful ones in the sight of their Lord: they shall have their reward and their light, and (as for) those who disbelieve and reject Our communications, these are the inmates of the hell. Know ye (all), that the life of this world is but play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting and multiplying, (in rivalry) among yourselves, riches and children. Here is a similitude: How rain and the growth which it brings forth, delight (the hearts of) the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a Penalty severe (for the devotees of wrong). And Forgiveness from God and (His) Good Pleasure (for the devotees of God). And what is the life of this world, but goods and chattels of deception? Know that the life of the world is only play, and idle talk, and pageantry, and boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children; as the likeness of vegetation after rain, whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman, but afterward it drieth up and thou seest it turning yellow, then it becometh straw. And in the Hereafter there is grievous punishment, and (also) forgiveness from God and His good pleasure, whereas the life of the world is but matter of illusion. Know that this world's life is only sport and play and gaiety and boasting among yourselves, and a vying in the multiplication of wealth and children, like the rain, whose causing the vegetation to grow, pleases the husbandmen, then it withers away so that you will see it become yellow, then it becomes dried up and broken down; and in the hereafter is a severe chastisement and (also) forgiveness from God and (His) pleasure; and this world's life is naught but means of deception. Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers: that is the Grace of God, which He bestows on whom he pleases: and God is the Lord of Grace abounding. Race one with another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whereof the breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth, which is in store for those who believe in God and His messengers. Such is the bounty of God, which He bestoweth upon whom He will, and God is of Infinite Bounty. Hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden the extensiveness of which is as the extensiveness of the heaven and the earth; it is prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers; that is the grace of God: He gives it to whom He pleases, and God is the Lord of mighty grace. No misfortune can happen on earth or in your souls but is recorded in a decree before We bring it into existence: That is truly easy for God: Naught of disaster befalleth in the earth or in yourselves but it is in a Book before we bring it into being - Lo! that is easy for God - No evil befalls on the earth nor in your own souls, but it is in a book before We bring it into existence; surely that is easy to God: In order that ye may not despair over matters that pass you by, nor exult over favours bestowed upon you. For God loveth not any vainglorious boaster,- That ye grieve not for the sake of that which hath escaped you, nor yet exult because of that which hath been given. God loveth not all prideful boasters, So that you may not grieve for what has escaped you, nor be exultant at what He has given you; and God does not love any arrogant boaster: Such persons as are covetous and commend covetousness to men. And if any turn back (from God's Way), verily God is Free of all Needs, Worthy of all Praise. Who hoard and who enjoin upon the people avarice. And whosoever turneth away, still God is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. Those who are niggardly and enjoin niggardliness on men; and whoever turns back, then surely God is He Who is the Self-sufficient, the Praised. We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong), that men may stand forth in justice; and We sent down Iron, in which is (material for) mighty war, as well as many benefits for mankind, that God may test who it is that will help, Unseen, Him and His messengers: For God is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might (and able to enforce His Will). We verily sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance, that mankind may observe right measure; and He revealed iron, wherein is mighty power and (many) uses for mankind, and that God may know him who helpeth Him and His messengers, though unseen. Lo! God is Strong, Almighty. Certainly We sent Our messengers with clear arguments, and sent down with them the Book and the balance that men may conduct themselves with equity; and We have made the iron, wherein is great violence and advantages to men, and that God may know who helps Him and His messengers in the secret; surely God is Strong, Mighty. And We sent Noah and Abraham, and established in their line Prophethood and Revelation: and some of them were on right guidance. But many of them became rebellious transgressors. And We verily sent Noah and Abraham and placed the Prophethood and the Scripture among their seed, and among them there is he who goeth right, but many of them are evil-livers. And certainly We sent Nuh and Ibrahim and We gave to their offspring the (gift of) prophecy and the Book; so there are among them those who go aright, and most of them are transgressors. Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers: We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel; and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of God; but that they did not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed, on those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors. Then We caused Our messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow, and gave him the Gospel, and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. But monasticism they invented - We ordained it not for them - only seeking God's pleasure, and they observed it not with right observance. So We give those of them who believe their reward, but many of them are evil-livers. Then We made Our messengers to follow in their footsteps, and We sent Isa son of Marium afterwards, and We gave him the Injeel, and We put in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy; and (as for) monkery, they innovated it We did not prescribe it to them only to seek God's pleasure, but they did not observe it with its due observance; so We gave to those of them who believed their reward, and most of them are transgressors. O ye that believe! Fear God, and believe in His Messenger, and He will bestow on you a double portion of His Mercy: He will provide for you a Light by which ye shall walk (straight in your path), and He will forgive you (your past): for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

For God is the Lord of Grace abounding. That the People of the Scripture may know that they control naught of the bounty of God, but that the bounty is in God's hand to give to whom He will. And God is of Infinite Bounty. So that the followers of the Book may know that they do not control aught of the grace of God, and that grace is in God's hand, He gives it to whom He pleases; and God is the Lord of mighty grace. In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. God has indeed heard (and accepted) the statement of the woman who pleads with thee concerning her husband and carries her complaint (in prayer) to God: and God (always) hears the arguments between both sides among you: for God hears and sees (all things). God hath heard the saying of her that disputeth with thee (Muhammad) concerning her husband, and complaineth unto God. And God heareth your colloquy. Lo! God is Hearer, Knower. God indeed knows the plea of her who pleads with you about her husband and complains to God, and God knows the contentions of both of you; surely God is Hearing, Seeing. If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar (calling them mothers), they cannot be their mothers: None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And in fact they use words (both) iniquitous and false: but truly God is one that blots out (sins), and forgives (again and again). Such of you as put away your wives (by saying they are as their mothers) - They are not their mothers; none are their mothers except those who gave them birth - they indeed utter an ill word and a lie. And lo! God is Forgiving, Merciful. (As for) those of you who put away their wives by likening their backs to the backs of their mothers, they are not their mothers; their mothers are no others than those who gave them birth; and most surely they utter a hateful word and a falsehood and most surely God is Pardoning, Forgiving. But those who divorce their wives by Zihar, then wish to go back on the words they uttered,- (It is ordained that such a one) should free a slave before they touch each other: Thus are ye admonished to perform: and God is well acquainted with (all) that ye do.Those who put away their wives (by saying they are as their mothers) and afterward would go back on that which they have said, the penalty in that case is the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this ye are exhorted; and God is Informed of what ye do. And if any has not the means, he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so, he should feed sixty indigent ones, that ye may show your faith in God and His Messenger. Those are limits set by God. For those who reject Him, there is a grievous Penalty. Those who resist God and His Messenger will be humbled to dust, as were those before them: for We have already sent down Clear Signs. And the Unbelievers will have a humiliating Penalty. On the Day that God will raise them all up again and show them the Truth and meaning of their conduct. God has reckoned its value, though they may have forgotten it, for God is Witness to all things. Seest thou not that God doth know all that is in the heavens and on earth? There is not a secret consultation between three, but He makes the fourth among them, nor between five but He makes the sixth, nor between fewer nor more, but He is in their midst, wheresoever they be. In the end, He will tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day of Judgment. For God has full knowledge of all things. Turnest thou not thy sight towards those who were forbidden secret counsels yet revert to that which they were forbidden to do? And they hold secret counsels among themselves for iniquity and hostility, and disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to thee, they salute thee, not as God salutes thee, but in crooked ways. And they say to themselves, "Why does not God punish us for our words?" Enough for them is Hell: In it will they burn, and evil is that destination! O ye who believe! When ye hold secret counsel, do it not for iniquity and hostility, and disobedience to the Prophet; but do it for righteousness and self-restraint; and fear God, to Whom ye shall be brought back. Secret counsels are only inspired by the Evil One, in order that he may cause grief to the Believers; but he cannot harm them in the least, except as God permits; and on God let the Believers put their trust. O ye who believe! When ye are told to make room in the assemblies, make room: ample room will God provide for you. And when ye are told to rise up, rise up: God will raise up, to suitable ranks and degrees, those of you who believe and who have been granted Knowledge: And God is well acquainted with all ye do. O ye who believe! When ye consult the Messenger in private, spend something in charity before your private consultation. That will be best for you, and most conducive to purity of conduct. But if ye find not the wherewithal, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation with him? If, then, ye do not so, and God forgives you, then at least establish regular prayer; practice regular charity; and obey God and His Messenger. And God is well acquainted with all that ye do. Turnest thou not thy attention to those who turn in friendship to such as have the Wrath of God upon them? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear to falsehood knowingly. God has prepared for them a severe Penalty: evil indeed are their deeds. They have made their oaths a screen for their misdeeds: thus they obstruct men from the Path of God: therefore shall they have a humiliating Penalty. Of no profit whatever to them, against God, will be their riches nor their sons: they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein forever! One day will God raise them all up for Judgment: then will they swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something to stand upon. No, indeed!On the day when God will raise them all together, they will swear to Him as they swear to you, thinking they have some standing. Truly, they are the liars! The Evil One has made them forget the remembrance of God. They are the Party of the Evil One, and it is the Party of the Evil One that will perish! Those who resist God and His Messenger will be among the most humiliated. God has decreed: "It is I and My messengers who must prevail." For God is full of strength, able to enforce His Will. You will not find any people who believe in God and the Last Day loving those who resist God and His Messenger, even if they are their fathers, sons, brothers, or kindred. For such, He has written Faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. God will be well pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of God, and it is the Party of God that will achieve Felicity.

Chapter 59: AL-HASHR (EXILE, BANISHMENT)
Total Verses: 24
Revealed At: MADINA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Whatever is in the heavens and on earth declares the Praises and Glory of God: for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering. Little did you think they would get out, and they thought their fortresses would defend them from God! But God came to them from quarters they did not expect and cast terror into their hearts, so they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers. Take warning, then, O you with eyes to see! If God had not decreed banishment for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world, and in the Hereafter, they shall have the Punishment of the Fire. This is because they resisted God and His Messenger. If anyone resists God, God is severe in Punishment. Whether you cut down the tender palm-trees or left them standing on their roots, it was by God's leave, to cover with shame the rebellious transgressors.

What God has bestowed on His Messenger from them, you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry, but God gives power to His messengers over any He pleases. God has power over all things. What God has bestowed on His Messenger from the people of the townships belongs to God, His Messenger, kindred, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer, so it does not merely circulate among the wealthy. So take what the Messenger assigns to you and deny yourselves what he withholds from you. Fear God, for God is strict in Punishment. Some part is due to the indigent Muhajirs, those who were expelled from their homes and property while seeking Grace from God and aiding God and His Messenger. Such are indeed the sincere ones. Those who had homes in Medina and adopted the Faith show their affection to those who came to them for refuge, preferring them over themselves even though poverty was their own lot. Those saved from the covetousness of their own souls are the ones who achieve prosperity.

Those who came after them say: "Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who came before us into the Faith, and leave not in our hearts any rancor against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed Full of Kindness, Most Merciful."Those who put away their wives by saying they are as their mothers and afterward would go back on that which they have said, the penalty in that case is the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this ye are exhorted; and God is Informed of what ye do. And if any has not the means, he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so, he should feed sixty indigent ones, that ye may show your faith in God and His Messenger. Those are limits set by God.

One day will God raise them all up for Judgment: then will they swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something to stand upon. No, indeed!Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethren among the People of the Book? - "If ye are expelled, we too will go out with you, and we will never hearken to any one in your affair; and if ye are attacked (in fight) we will help you". But God is witness that they are indeed liars. If they are expelled, never will they go out with them; and if they are attacked (in fight), they will never help them; and if they do help them, they will turn their backs; so they will receive no help. Of a truth ye are stronger (than they) because of the terror in their hearts, (sent) by God. This is because they are men devoid of understanding. They will not fight you (even) together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls. Strong is their fighting (spirit) amongst themselves: thou wouldst think they were united, but their hearts are divided: that is because they are a people devoid of wisdom. Like those who lately preceded them, they have tasted the evil result of their conduct; and (in the Hereafter there is) for them a grievous Penalty. (Their allies deceived them), like the Evil One, when he says to man, "Deny God": but when (man) denies God, (the Evil One) says, "I am free of thee: I do fear God, the Lord of the Worlds!" The end of both will be that they will go into the Fire, dwelling therein forever. Such is the reward of the wrong-doers. O ye who believe! Fear God, and let every soul look to what (provision) He has sent forth for the morrow. Yea, fear God: for God is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do. And be ye not like those who forgot God; and He made them forget their own souls! Such are the rebellious transgressors! Not equal are the Companions of the Fire and the Companions of the Garden: it is the Companions of the Garden, that will achieve Felicity. Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, verily, thou wouldst have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of God. Such are the similitudes which We propound to men, that they may reflect. God is He, than Whom there is no other god; Who knows (all things) both secret and open; He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. God is He, than Whom there is no other god; the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace (and Perfection), the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver of Safety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to God! (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him. He is God, the Creator, the Evolver, the Bestower of Forms (or Colours). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.On the day when God will raise them all together, they will swear to Him as they swear to you, thinking they have some standing. Truly, they are the liars. The Evil One has made them forget the remembrance of God. They are the Party of the Evil One, and they will perish.

But not when Abraham said to his father: "I will pray for forgiveness for you, though I have no power to get anything on your behalf from God." They prayed: "Our Lord! In You do we trust, and to You do we turn in repentance: to You is our Final Goal." There is a good example for you in Abraham and those with him, when they told their people: "We are guiltless of you and all that you worship besides God. We have done with you. And there has arisen between us and you hostility and hate forever until you believe in God only, except for what Abraham promised his father when he said: 'I will ask forgiveness for you, though I own nothing for you from God.' Our Lord! In You we put our trust, and to You we turn repentant, and to You is the journeying." Indeed, there is for you a good example in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people: "Surely we are clear of you and of what you serve besides God; we declare ourselves to be clear of you, and enmity and hatred have appeared between us and you forever until you believe in God alone, except for what Abraham said to his father: 'I would certainly ask forgiveness for you, and I do not control anything for you from God.'

060.005: "Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the Unbelievers, but forgive us, our Lord! for You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise." 

060.006: There was indeed in them an excellent example for you to follow, for those whose hope is in God and in the Last Day. But if any turn away, truly God is Free of all Wants, Worthy of all Praise. 

060.007: It may be that God will grant love and friendship between you and those whom you now hold as enemies. For God has power over all things; And God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 

060.008: God forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for your Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for God loves those who are just. 

060.009: God only forbids you, with regard to those who fight you for your Faith, and drive you out of your homes, and support others in driving you out, from turning to them for friendship and protection. It is such as turn to them in these circumstances that do wrong. 

060.010: O you who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees, examine and test them: God knows best as to their Faith: if you ascertain that they are Believers, then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not lawful wives for the Unbelievers, nor are the Unbelievers lawful husbands for them. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent on their dower, and there will be no blame on you if you marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: ask for what you have spent on their dowers, and let the Unbelievers ask for what they have spent on the dowers of women who come over to you. Such is the command of God: He judges with justice between you. And God is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom. 

060.011: And if any of your wives deserts you to the Unbelievers, and you have an accession by the coming over of a woman from the other side, then pay to those whose wives have deserted the equivalent of what they had spent on their dower. And fear God, in Whom you believe. 

060.012: O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you, that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with God, that they will not steal, that they will not commit adultery or fornication, that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood, and that they will not disobey you in any just matter, then do you receive their fealty, and pray to God for the forgiveness of their sins: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 

060.013: O you who believe! Turn not for friendship to people on whom is the Wrath of God; of the Hereafter they are already in despair, just as the Unbelievers are in despair about those buried in graves. 

Chapter 61: AS-SAFF (THE RANKS, BATTLE ARRAY) Total Verses: 14 Revealed At: MADINA 

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 

061.001: Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, let it declare the Praises and Glory of God: for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. 

061.002: O you who believe! Why say you that which you do not? 

061.003: Grievously odious is it in the sight of God that you say that which you do not. 

061.004: Truly God loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure. 

061.005: And remember, Moses said to his people: "O my people! Why do you vex and insult me, though you know that I am the messenger of God sent to you?" Then when they went wrong, God let their hearts go wrong. For God guides not those who are rebellious transgressors."and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever, unless you believe in God and Him alone." But not when Abraham said to his father: "I will pray for forgiveness for you, though I have no power to get anything on your behalf from God." They prayed: "Our Lord! In You do we trust, and to You do we turn in repentance: to You is our Final Goal." There is a good example for you in Abraham and those with him, when they told their people: "We are guiltless of you and all that you worship besides God. We have done with you. And there has arisen between us and you hostility and hate forever until you believe in God only, except for what Abraham promised his father when he said: 'I will ask forgiveness for you, though I own nothing for you from God.' Our Lord! In You we put our trust, and to You we turn repentant, and to You is the journeying." Indeed, there is for you a good example in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people: "Surely we are clear of you and of what you serve besides God; we declare ourselves to be clear of you, and enmity and hatred have appeared between us and you forever until you believe in God alone, except for what Abraham said to his father: 'I would certainly ask forgiveness for you, and I do not control for you anything from God.' Our Lord! On You do we rely, and to You do we turn, and to You is the eventual coming." 

"Our Lord! Make us not a test and trial for the Unbelievers, but forgive us, our Lord! For You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise." There was indeed in them an excellent example for you to follow, for those whose hope is in God and in the Last Day. But if any turn away, truly God is Free of all Wants, Worthy of all Praise. Verily, you have in them a good example for everyone who looks to God and the Last Day. And whoever may turn away, still God is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. Certainly, there is for you in them a good example, for him who fears God and the Last Day; and whoever turns back, then surely God is the Self-sufficient, the Praised.

It may be that God will grant love and friendship between you and those whom you now hold as enemies. For God has power over all things; and God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. God forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for your Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for God loves those who are just. God forbids you only those who warred against you on account of religion and have driven you out from your homes and helped to drive you out, that you make friends of them. Whoever makes friends of them, such are wrong-doers.

O you who believe! When believing women come to you as refugees, examine and test them: God knows best as to their Faith. If you ascertain that they are Believers, then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not lawful wives for the Unbelievers, nor are the Unbelievers lawful husbands for them. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent on their dower, and there will be no blame on you if you marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: ask for what you have spent on their dowers, and let the Unbelievers ask for what they have spent on the dowers of women who come over to you. Such is the command of God: He judges with justice between you. And God is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.

And if any of your wives deserts you to the Unbelievers, and you have an accession by the coming over of a woman from the other side, then pay to those whose wives have deserted the equivalent of what they had spent on their dower. And fear God, in Whom you believe.

O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you, that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with God, that they will not steal, that they will not commit adultery or fornication, that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood, and that they will not disobey you in any just matter, then do you receive their fealty, and pray to God for the forgiveness of their sins: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

061.006: And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of God sent to you, confirming the Law before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, "This is evident sorcery!"

061.007: Who does greater wrong than one who invents falsehood against God, even as he is being invited to Islam? And God guides not those who do wrong.

Then a portion of the Children of Israel believed, and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed.

062.004: Such is the Bounty of God, which He bestows on whom He will: and God is the Lord of the highest bounty.

062.005: The similitude of those who were charged with the obligations of the Mosaic Law, but who subsequently failed in those obligations, is that of a donkey which carries huge tomes but understands them not. Evil is the similitude of people who falsify the Signs of God: and God guides not people who do wrong.

062.006: Say: "O you that stand on Judaism! If you think that you are friends to God, to the exclusion of other men, then express your desire for Death, if you are truthful!"

062.007: But never will they express their desire for Death, because of the deeds their hands have sent on before them! And God knows well those that do wrong!

Total Verses: 11
Revealed At: MADINA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

63:1 When the Hypocrites come to thee, they say, "We bear witness that thou art indeed the Messenger of God." Yea, God knoweth that thou art indeed His Messenger, and God beareth witness that the Hypocrites are indeed liars.

63:2 They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of God: truly evil are their deeds.

63:3 That is because they believed, then they rejected Faith: So a seal was set on their hearts: therefore they understand not.

63:4 When thou lookest at them, their exteriors please thee; and when they speak, thou listenest to their words. They are as (worthless as hollow) pieces of timber propped up, (unable to stand on their own). They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies; so beware of them. The curse of God be on them! How are they deluded (away from the Truth)!

63:5 And when it is said to them, "Come, the Messenger of God will pray for your forgiveness", they turn aside their heads, and thou wouldst see them turning away their faces in arrogance.

63:6 It is equal to them whether thou pray for their forgiveness or not. God will not forgive them. Truly God guides not rebellious transgressors.

63:7 They are the ones who say, "Spend nothing on those who are with God's Messenger, to the end that they may disperse (and quit Medina)." But to God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the Hypocrites understand not.

63:8 They say, "If we return to Medina, surely the more honourable (element) will expel therefrom the meaner." But honour belongs to God and His Messenger, and to the Believers; but the Hypocrites know not.

63:9 O ye who believe! Let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of God. If any act thus, the loss is their own.

63:10 And spend something (in charity) out of the substance which We have bestowed on you, before Death should come to any of you and he should say, "O my Lord! why didst Thou not give me respite for a little while? I should then have given (largely) in charity, and I should have been one of the doers of good."

63:11 But to no soul will God grant respite when the time appointed (for it) has come; and God is well acquainted with (all) that ye do.

64:7 The Unbelievers think that they will not be raised up (for Judgment). Say: "Yea, by my Lord, Ye shall surely be raised up: then shall ye be told (the truth) of all that ye did. And that is easy for God."

Revealed At: MADINA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which God has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. God has already ordained for you the dissolution of your oaths (in some cases): and God is your Protector, and He is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.

When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his consorts, and she then divulged it (to another), and God made it known to him, he confirmed part thereof and repudiated a part. Then when he told her thereof, she said, "Who told thee this?" He said, "He told me Who knows and is well-acquainted with all things."

If you two turn in repentance to Him, your hearts are indeed so inclined; but if you back up each other against him, truly God is his Protector, and Gabriel, and every righteous one among those who believe, and furthermore, the angels will back him up. It may be, if he divorced you all, that God will give him in exchange consorts better than you, who submit, who believe, who are devout, who turn to God in repentance, who worship in humility, who travel for Faith and fast, previously married or virgins.

O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who flinch not from executing the Commands they receive from God, but do precisely what they are commanded. They will say, "O you Unbelievers! Make no excuses this Day! You are being but requited for all that you did!"

O you who believe! Turn to God with sincere repentance: in the hope that your Lord will remove from you your ills and admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, the Day that God will not permit to be humiliated the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their Light will run forward before them and by their right hands, while they say, "Our Lord! Perfect our Light for us, and grant us Forgiveness: for Thou hast power over all things."

O Prophet! Strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell, an evil refuge indeed. God sets forth, for an example to the Unbelievers, the wife of Noah and the wife of Lut: they were under two of our righteous servants, but they were false to their husbands, and they profited nothing before God on their account, but were told: "Enter the Fire along with others that enter!"n him. God puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. After a difficulty, God will soon grant relief.

065.008: How many populations that insolently opposed the command of their Lord and His messengers did We not then call to account and impose on them an exemplary punishment.

065.009: Then did they taste the evil result of their conduct, and the end of their conduct was perdition.

065.010: God has prepared for them a severe punishment. Therefore, fear God, O men of understanding who have believed! For God has indeed sent down to you a message.

065.011: A Messenger, who rehearses to you the signs of God containing clear explanations, that he may lead forth those who believe and do righteous deeds from the depths of darkness into light. And those who believe in God and work righteousness, He will admit to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever: God has indeed granted for them a most excellent provision.

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Nun. By the Pen and the (Record) which (men) write,- Thou art not, by the Grace of thy Lord, mad or possessed. Nay, verily for thee is a Reward unfailing: And thou (standest) on an exalted standard of character. Soon wilt thou see, and they will see, Which of you is afflicted with madness. Verily it is thy Lord that knoweth best, which (among men) hath strayed from His Path: and He knoweth best those who receive (true) Guidance. So hearken not to those who deny (the Truth). Their desire is that thou shouldst be pliant: so would they be pliant. Heed not the type of despicable men,- ready with oaths, A slanderer, going about with calumnies, (Habitually) hindering (all) good, transgressing beyond bounds, deep in sin, Violent (and cruel),- with all that, base-born,- Because he possesses wealth and (numerous) sons. When to him are rehearsed Our Signs, "Tales of the ancients", he cries! Soon shall We brand (the beast) on the snout! Verily We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden, when they resolved to gather the fruits of the (garden) in the morning. But made no reservation, ("If it be God's Will"). Then there came on the (garden) a visitation from thy Lord, (which swept away) all around, while they were asleep. So the (garden) became, by the morning, like a dark and desolate spot, (whose fruit had been gathered). As the morning broke, they called out, one to another,- "Go ye to your tilth (betimes) in the morning, if ye would gather the fruits." So they departed, conversing in secret low tones, (saying)- "Let not a single indigent person break in upon you into the (garden) this day." And they opened the morning, strong in an (unjust) resolve. But when they saw the (garden), they said: "We have surely lost our way:" "Indeed we are shut out (of the fruits of our labour)!" Said one of them, more just (than the rest): "Did I not say to you, 'Why not glorify (God)?'" They said: "Glory to our Lord! Verily we have been doing wrong!" Then they turned, one against another, in reproach. They said: "Alas for us! We have indeed transgressed!" "It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this: for we do turn to Him (in repentance)!" Such is the Punishment (in this life); but greater is the Punishment in the Hereafter,- if only they knew! Verily, for the Righteous, are Gardens of Delight, in the Presence of their Lord. Shall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin? What is the matter with you? How judge ye? Or have ye a book through which ye learn- That ye shall have, through it whatever ye choose? Or have ye Covenants with Us to oath, reaching to the Day of Judgment, (providing) that ye shall have whatever ye shall demand? Ask thou of them, which of them will stand surety for that! Or have they some "Partners" (in Godhead)? Then let them produce their "partners", if they are truthful! The Day that the shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to bow in adoration, but they shall not be able,- On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate themselves but are not able, On the day when there shall be a severe affliction, and they shall be called upon to make obeisance, who travel for faith and fast, previously married or virgins.

066.006: O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who flinch not from executing the commands they receive from God, but do precisely what they are commanded.

066.007: They will say, "O you unbelievers! Make no excuses this day! You are being but requited for all that you did!"

066.008: O you who believe! Turn to God with sincere repentance: in the hope that your Lord will remove from you your ills and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow, the day that God will not permit to be humiliated the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run forward before them and by their right hands, while they say, "Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and grant us forgiveness: for You have power over all things."

066.009: O Prophet! Strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell, an evil refuge indeed.

066.010: God sets forth, for an example to the unbelievers, the wife of Noah and the wife of Lut: they were respectively under two of our righteous servants, but they were false to their husbands, and they profited nothing before God on their account, but were told, "Enter the fire along with others that enter!"

066.011: And God sets forth, as an example to those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh: Behold she said: "O my Lord! Build for me, in nearness to Thee, a mansion in the Garden, and save me from Pharaoh and his doings, and save me from those that do wrong."

066.012: And Mary the daughter of 'Imran, who guarded her chastity; and We breathed into her of Our spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord and of His Revelations, and was one of the devout servants.

067.001: Blessed be He in Whose hands is Dominion; and He over all things hath Power.

067.002: He Who created Death and Life, that He may try which of you is best in deed: and He is the Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving.

067.003: He Who created the seven heavens one above another: No want of proportion wilt thou see in the Creation of God Most Gracious. So turn thy vision again: seest thou any flaw?

067.004: Again turn thy vision a second time: thy vision will come back to thee dull and discomfited, in a state worn out.

067.005: And we have adorned the lowest heaven with Lamps, and We have made such Lamps as missiles to drive away the Evil Ones, and have prepared for them the Penalty of the Blazing Fire.

067.006: For those who reject their Lord is the Penalty of Hell: and evil is such a destination.

067.007: When they are cast therein, they will hear the terrible drawing in of its breath even as it blazes forth.

067.008: Almost bursting with fury: Every time a group is cast therein, its Keepers will ask, "Did no Warner come to you?"

067.009: They will say: "Yes indeed; a Warner did come to us, but we rejected him and said, 'God never sent down any Message: you are nothing but an egregious delusion!'"

067.010: They will further say: "Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we should not now be among the Companions of the Blazing Fire!"

067.011: They will then confess their sins: but far will be Forgiveness from the Companions of the Blazing Fire.

067.012: As for those who fear their Lord unseen, for them is Forgiveness and a great Reward.

067.013: And whether you hide your word or publish it, He certainly has full knowledge of the secrets of all hearts.

067.014: Should He not know, He that created? And He is the One that understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted with them.

067.015: It is He Who has made the earth manageable for you, so traverse through its tracts and enjoy the Sustenance which He furnishes: but unto Him is the Resurrection.

067.016: Do you feel secure that He Who is in heaven will not cause you to be swallowed up by the earth when it shakes as in an earthquake?

067.017: Or do you feel secure that He Who is in Heaven will not send against you a violent tornado with showers of stones, so that you shall know how terrible was My warning?

067.018: But indeed men before them rejected My warning: then how terrible was My rejection of them?

067.019: Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading their wings and folding them in? None can uphold them except God Most Gracious: Truly it is He that watches over all things.

067.020: Nay, who is there that can help you, even as an army, besides God Most Merciful? In nothing but delusion are the Unbelievers.

067.021: Or who is there that can provide you with Sustenance if He were to withhold His provision? Nay, they obstinately persist in insolent impiety and flight from the Truth.

067.022: Is then one who walks headlong, with his face grovelling, better guided, or one who walks evenly on a Straight Way?

067.023: Say: "It is He Who has created you and made for you the faculties of hearing, seeing, feeling, and understanding: little thanks it is you give."

068.001: Nun. By the Pen and the Record which men write,

068.002: You are not, by the Grace of your Lord, mad or possessed.

068.003: Verily for you is a Reward unfailing.

068.004: And you stand on an exalted standard of character.

068.008: So hearken not to those who deny the Truth.

068.009: Their desire is that you should be pliant: so would they be pliant.

068.010: Heed not the type of despicable men, ready with oaths,

068.011: A slanderer, going about with calumnies,

068.012: Habitually hindering all good, transgressing beyond bounds, deep in sin,

068.016: Soon shall We brand the beast on the snout!

068.017: Verily We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden, when they resolved to gather the fruits of the garden in the morning.

068.018: But made no reservation, "If it be God's Will."

068.019: Then there came on the garden a visitation from your Lord, which swept away all around, while they were asleep.

068.020: So the garden became, by the morning, like a dark and desolate spot, whose fruit had been gathered.

068.021: As the morning broke, they called out, one to another,

068.022: "Go to your tilth in the morning, if you would gather the fruits."

068.023: So they departed, conversing in secret low tones,

068.024: "Let not a single indigent person break in upon you into the garden this day."

068.025: And they opened the morning, strong in an unjust resolve.

068.026: But when they saw the garden, they said: "We have surely lost our way."

068.027: "Indeed we are shut out of the fruits of our labor!"

068.028: Said one of them, more just than the rest: "Did I not say to you, 'Why not glorify God?'"

068.029: They said: "Glory to our Lord! Verily we have been doing wrong!"

068.030: Then they turned, one against another, in reproach.

068.031: They said: "Alas for us! We have indeed transgressed!"

068.032: "It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this: for we do turn to Him in repentance!"

068.033: Such is the Punishment in this life; but greater is the Punishment in the Hereafter, if only they knew!

068.034: Verily, for the Righteous, are Gardens of Delight, in the Presence of their Lord.

068.035: Shall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin?

068.036: What is the matter with you? How do you judge?

068.037: Or have you a book through which you learn,

068.038: That you shall have, through it whatever you choose?

068.039: Or have you Covenants with Us to oath, reaching to the Day of Judgment, providing that you shall have whatever you shall demand?

068.040: Ask them, which of them will stand surety for that!

068.041: Or have they some "Partners" in Godhead? Then let them produce their "partners," if they are truthful!

068.042: The Day that the shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to bow in adoration, but they shall not be able.Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them; seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration, while they were whole, and had refused. With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. Their looks cast down, abasement shall overtake them; and they were called upon to make obeisance indeed while yet they were safe. Then leave Me alone with such as reject this Message: by degrees shall We punish them from directions they perceive not. Leave Me to deal with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. So leave Me and him who rejects this announcement; We will overtake them by degrees, from whence they perceive not. A long respite will I grant them: truly powerful is My Plan. Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. And I do bear with them, surely My plan is firm. Or is it that thou dost ask them for a reward, so that they are burdened with a load of debt? Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed? Or do you ask from them a reward, so that they are burdened with debt? Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down? Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof)? Or have they (the knowledge of) the unseen, so that they write (it) down? So wait with patience for the Command of thy Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish, when he cried out in agony. But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried out in despair. So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, and be not like the companion of the fish, when he cried while he was in distress. Had not Grace from his Lord reached him, he would indeed have been cast off on the naked shore, in disgrace. Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. Were it not that favor from his Lord had overtaken him, he would certainly have been cast down upon the naked ground while he was blamed. Thus did his Lord choose him and make him of the Company of the Righteous. But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. Then his Lord chose him, and He made him of the good. And the Unbelievers would almost trip thee up with their eyes when they hear the Message; and they say: "Surely he is possessed!" And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; And those who disbelieve would almost smite you with their eyes when they hear the reminder, and they say: Most surely he is mad. But it is nothing less than a Message to all the worlds. When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation. And it is naught but a reminder to the nations.This is verily the word of an honored messenger; it is not the word of a poet: little it is you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer: little admonition you receive. This is a Message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds. If the messenger were to invent any sayings in Our name, We should certainly seize him by his right hand and cut off the artery of his heart. Nor could any of you withhold him from Our wrath. This is a Message for the God-fearing. We know that some among you will deny it. Truly, Revelation is a cause of sorrow for the Unbelievers. It is Truth of assured certainty. So glorify the name of your Lord Most High.

Chapter 70: AL-MAARIJ (THE ASCENDING STAIRWAYS)
Total Verses: 44
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

A questioner asked about a Penalty to befall the Unbelievers, which none can repel, from God, Lord of the Ways of Ascent. The angels and the spirit ascend unto Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years. Therefore, hold Patience, a Patience of beautiful contentment. They see the Day as a far-off event, but We see it near. The Day that the sky will be like molten brass, and the mountains will be like wool, and no friend will ask after a friend, though they will be put in sight of each other. The sinner's desire will be to redeem himself from the Penalty of that Day by sacrificing his children, his wife, his brother, his kindred who sheltered him, and all that is on earth, so it could deliver him. By no means! It would be the Fire of Hell, plucking out his being right to the skull, inviting all such as turn their backs and turn away their faces from the Right, and collect wealth and hide it from use.

Truly, man was created very impatient, fretful when evil touches him, and niggardly when good reaches him. Not so those devoted to Prayer, those who remain steadfast to their prayer, and those in whose wealth is a recognized right for the needy who ask and him who is prevented from asking. Those who hold to the truth of the Day of Judgment, and those who fear the displeasure of their Lord, for their Lord's displeasure is the opposite of Peace and Tranquillity. Those who guard their chastity, except with their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess, for then they are not to be blamed. But those who trespass beyond this are transgressors. Those who respect their trusts and covenants, and those who stand firm in their testimonies, and those who guard the sacredness of their worship. Such will be the honored ones in the Gardens of Bliss.

What is the matter with the Unbelievers that they rush madly before you, from the right and from the left, in crowds? Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss? By no means! For We have created them out of the base matter they know. Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We can certainly substitute for them better men than they, and We are not to be defeated in Our Plan. So leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about until they encounter that Day of theirs which they have been promised. The Day when they will issue from their sepulchers in sudden haste as if they were rushing to a goal-post fixed for them, their eyes lowered in dejection, ignominy covering them all over. Such is the Day which they are promised.Chapter 71: NOOH (NOAH)

P: Lo! the vigil of the night is (a time) when impression is more keen and speech more certain.

P: Lo! We have sent unto you a messenger as witness against you, even as We sent unto Pharaoh a messenger. S: Surely We have sent to you a Messenger, a witness against you, as We sent a messenger to Firon. 073.016Y: But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger; so We seized him with a heavy Punishment. P: But Pharaoh rebelled against the messenger, whereupon We seized him with no gentle grip. S: But Firon disobeyed the messenger, so We laid on him a violent hold."Then how shall ye, if ye deny (God), guard yourselves against a Day that will make children hoary-headed? The sky will be cleft asunder; His Promise must be accomplished. This is an Admonition: let him who will, take a path to his Lord! Thy Lord knows that thou standest in prayer by night, and so do a party of those with thee. But God appoints night and day in due measure. He knows that some are ill, others travel, and others fight in God's Cause. So read of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you; establish regular Prayer and Charity; and loan to God a Beautiful Loan. Whatever good you send forth for your souls, you will find it with God, better and greater in reward. Seek the Grace of God: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

O thou wrapped up (in the mantle)! Arise and deliver thy warning! Magnify thy Lord! Keep thy garments free from stain! Shun all abomination! Nor expect, in giving, any increase for thyself! Be patient and constant for thy Lord's Cause! When the Trumpet is sounded, that Day will be a Day of Distress, far from easy for those without Faith. Leave Me alone to deal with the creature whom I created alone, to whom I granted resources in abundance, and sons to be by his side, and made life smooth and comfortable. Yet he is greedy that I should add more. By no means! For to Our Signs he has been refractory. Soon will I visit him with a mount of calamities! For he thought and plotted; and woe to him! How he plotted! Then he looked round; then he frowned and scowled; then he turned back and was haughty; then said he: "This is nothing but magic, derived from of old; this is nothing but the word of a mortal!" Soon will I cast him into Hell-Fire! And what will explain to thee what Hell-Fire is? Naught does it permit to endure, and naught does it leave alone! Darkening and changing the color of man! Over it are Nineteen. We have set none but angels as Guardians of the Fire; and We have fixed their number only as a trial for Unbelievers, in order that the People of the Book may arrive at certainty, and the Believers may increase in Faith, and that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the Believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the Unbelievers may say, "What symbol does God intend by this?" Thus does God leave to stray whom He pleases, and guide whom He pleases: and none can know the forces of thy Lord, except He. This is no other than a warning to mankind.

Nay, verily: By the Moon, and by the Night as it retreats, and by the Dawn as it shines forth, this is but one of the mighty portents, a warning to mankind, to any of you that chooses to press forward, or to follow behind. Every soul will be held in pledge for its deeds, except the Companions of the Right Hand. They will be in Gardens of Delight, questioning each other, and asking of the Sinners: "What led you into Hell Fire?" They will say: "We were not of those who prayed; nor were we of those who fed the indigent."This will contain the original content of the document, unchanged just edited to be more readable and AI friendly.

083.003 But when they have to give by measure or weight to men, give less than due.
083.004 Do they not think that they will be called to account?
083.005 On a Mighty Day,
083.006 A Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds?
083.007 Nay! Surely the record of the wicked is in Sijjin.

083.010 Woe, that Day, to those that deny,
083.011 Those that deny the Day of Judgment.
083.012 And none can deny it but the Transgressor beyond bounds the Sinner!
083.013 When Our Signs are rehearsed to him, he says, "Tales of the ancients!"
083.014 By no means! but on their hearts is the stain of the (ill) which they do!
083.015 Verily, from (the Light of) their Lord, that Day, will they be veiled.
083.016 Further, they will enter the Fire of Hell.
083.017 Further, it will be said to them: "This is the (reality) which ye rejected as false!"
083.018 Nay, verily the record of the Righteous is in 'Illiyin.
083.019 And what will explain to thee what 'Illiyun is?
083.020 (There is) a Register (fully) inscribed,

083.022 Truly the Righteous will be in Bliss:
083.023 On Thrones (of Dignity) will they command a sight (of all things):
083.024 Thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of Bliss.
083.025 Their thirst will be slaked with Pure Wine sealed:
083.026 The seal thereof will be Musk: And for this let those aspire, who have aspirations:
083.027 With it will be (given) a mixture of Tasnim:
083.028 A spring, from (the waters) whereof drink those Nearest to God.
083.029 Those in sin used to laugh at those who believed,
083.030 And whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other (in mockery);
083.031 And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting;
083.032 And whenever they saw them, they would say, "Behold! These are the people truly astray!"
083.033 But they had not been sent as keepers over them!
083.034 But on this Day the Believers will laugh at the Unbelievers:

084.013 Truly, did he go about among his people, rejoicing!
084.014 Truly, did he think that he would not have to return (to Us)!
084.015 Nay, nay! for his Lord was (ever) watchful of him!

084.019 Ye shall surely travel from stage to stage.
084.020 What then is the matter with them, that they believe not?
084.021 And when the Qur'an is read to them, they fall not prostrate,
084.022 But on the contrary the Unbelievers reject (it).
084.023 But God has full knowledge of what they secrete (in their breasts)
084.024 So announce to them a Penalty Grievous,
084.025 Except to those who believe and work righteous deeds: For them is a Reward that will never fail.

083.014 By no means! but on their hearts is the stain of the (ill) which they do!
083.015 Verily, from (the Light of) their Lord, that Day, will they be veiled.

083.018 Nay, verily the record of the Righteous is in 'Illiyin.
083.019 And what will explain to thee what 'Illiyun is?
083.020 (There is) a Register (fully) inscribed,
083.021 To which bear witness those Nearest (to God).
083.022 Truly the Righteous will be in Bliss:
083.023 On Thrones (of Dignity) will they command a sight (of all things):
083.024 Thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of Bliss.
083.025 Their thirst will be slaked with Pure Wine sealed:
083.026 The seal thereof will be Musk: And for this let those aspire, who have aspirations:
083.027 With it will be (given) a mixture of Tasnim:
083.028 A spring, from (the waters) whereof drink those Nearest to God.
083.029 Those in sin used to laugh at those who believed,
083.030 And whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other (in mockery);
083.031 And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting;
083.032 And whenever they saw them, they would say, "Behold! These are the people truly astray!"
083.033 But they had not been sent as keepers over them!
083.034 But on this Day the Believers will laugh at the Unbelievers:
083.035 On Thrones (of Dignity) they will command (a sight) (of all things).
083.036 Will not the Unbelievers have been paid back for what they did?

And with the Thamud (people), who cut out huge rocks in the valley? And with Pharaoh, lord of stakes? 089.011 All these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands, and heaped therein mischief on mischief. Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements: for thy Lord is ever watchful. 089.015 Now, as for man, when his Lord trieth him, giving him honour and gifts, then saith he, "My Lord hath honoured me." But when He trieth him, restricting his subsistence for him, then saith he, "My Lord hath humiliated me!" 089.017 Nay, but ye honour not the orphans, nor do ye encourage one another to feed the poor!

And what will explain to thee the path that is steep? It is freeing the bondman, or the giving of food in a day of privation to the orphan with claims of relationship, or to the indigent down in the dust.

089.004 And by the Night when it passeth away;-
089.005 Is there (not) in these an adjuration (or evidence) for those who understand?
089.006 Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the 'Ad (people),-
089.007 Of the (city of) Iram, with lofty pillars,
089.008 The like of which were not produced in (all) the land?
089.009 And with the Thamud (people), who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley?-
089.010 And with Pharaoh, lord of stakes?
089.011 (All) these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands,
089.012 And heaped therein mischief (on mischief).
089.013 Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements:
089.014 For thy Lord is (as a Guardian) on a watch-tower.
089.015 Now, as for man, when his Lord trieth him, giving him honour and gifts, then saith he, (puffed up), "My Lord hath honoured me."
089.016 But when He trieth him, restricting his subsistence for him, then saith he (in despair), "My Lord hath humiliated me!"

089.018 Nor do ye encourage one another to feed the poor!-

089.021 Nay! When the earth is pounded to powder,
089.022 And thy Lord cometh, and His angels, rank upon rank,
089.023 And Hell, that Day, is brought (face to face),- on that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance profit him?
089.024 He will say: "Ah! Would that I had sent forth (good deeds) for (this) my (Future) Life!"
089.025 For, that Day, His Chastisement will be such as none (else) can inflict,
