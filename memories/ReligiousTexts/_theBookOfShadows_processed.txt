In the Magic Circle, the words, commands, and wishes of the High Priestess are Law. She is the earthly representative of our gracious Goddess. She is to be obeyed and respected in all things. She is our Lady and, above all others, a Queen in the highest sense of the word. All female coveners will curtsy and say "Blessed Be" when they come before Her, and all male coveners will bend their knee and kiss Her on the right cheek and say "Blessed Be."

In the Magic Circle, the High Priest is the earthly representative of the Great God. He commands the respect due a Magus, Lord Counselor, and father.

The Laws were made for the Witches to advise them in their troubles. Do not change them lightly. The Witches should worship the Gods as is their due and obey their will. For the worship of the Gods is good for the Witches even as the worship of the Witches is good for the Gods: For the Gods love all their Witches. As a man loves a woman more by learning more of her wants and desires, so should the Witches love the Gods by the learning (mastering) of them.

It is necessary that the Magic Circle, which is the Temple of the Gods in these times, be cast and purified such that it may be a fitting place for the Gods; and the Witches should be properly prepared and purified to enter into the presence of the Gods. With love and worship in their hearts, the Witches shall raise power from their bodies (and the elements around them), and they shall offer this power to the Gods so that the Gods may help their Witches.

The High Priestess shall rule her coven as the representative of the Goddess, and the High Priest shall support her as the representative of the God. The High Priestess will choose any member of the coven to be her High Priest if he has sufficient standing in the coven. As the God Himself kissed our Lady's feet, gave Her the five-fold salute, and offered Her His power because of Her youth and beauty, Her sweetness and kindness, Her wisdom and justice, Her humility, gentleness, and generosity, and shared His power with Her, so therefore the High Priestess should always be aware that all power comes from Him; it is only lent, to be used wisely and justly.

The greatest virtue of a High Priestess shall be recognition that youth is necessary to the representative of the Goddess. She will, therefore, gracefully retire in favor of a younger covener should the coven so decide in council. The true High Priestess should realize that gracefully surrendering the pride of place is one of the greatest virtues, and that thereby she will return to that pride of place in another life with even greater power and beauty.

In the Old Days, when there were many Witches, we were free and worshipped freely in the greatest temples; but in these times, we must celebrate our sacred mysteries in secret. Therefore, none but the Witches are to see our mysteries; no coven shall know the location of any other coven or who its members are, except the High Priest, the High Priestess, and the Messenger; and that there shall be no communication among the covens, except by the Messenger of the Gods or the Summoner. Only if it is safe may the covens meet in some safe place for the Great Festivals; and while there, none shall give their true names or any information about their coven or its members. This law is made for this reason: No one can tell our enemies what they do not themselves know.

It is ordained that no one shall tell any person not in the Craft who other Witches are, or give them names or addresses, or in any way tell anything that can betray a Witch to their face. Nor may anyone tell where the covendom or covenstead is, where any meetings are held, or any other information about the coven unless directed to do so by the coven in council. If anyone breaks these laws, even under torture, may the Curse of the God and the Goddess be upon them, so that they may not be reborn upon the Earth (but shall live forever in the Hell of the Christians).

Let each High Priest and High Priestess govern their coven with justice and love, with the help and advice of the other and of the elders of the coven, always heeding the advice of the Messenger of the Gods if he should arrive. They will heed all the suggestions of their coveners and strive to settle any differences among them. It is recognized that there will always be people who will try to make everybody agree with their ideas: these people are not necessarily bad -- they often have good ideas and these ideas should be discussed in council. But if they will not come to agree with their other coveners or if they say "I will not work with this High Priestess," then the elders will have them leave. It should be suggested that they might join another coven, or if they are of sufficient standing, they may be encouraged to found their own coven. For it is better this way, to avoid strife among the family of Witches.

When using geographic boundaries, whenever anyone of Third Degree lives more than a league from the covenstead (or are about to), any of these may found a new coven; indeed, any Witch living within the covenstead who wishes to form a new coven will inform the elders of this intention and immediately move to a new dwelling beyond the boundaries of known covensteads. Members of any coven may choose to join the new coven when it is formed, but they must totally avoid their old coven if they choose this course. The elders of the old and new covens should meet in peace and love to determine the boundaries of the covens. Any Witch living outside of any two covens may choose to join either coven, but never both. All may meet for the Great Festivals if the elders agree, so long as they meet in peace and love. Let the elders confer as to the use of this law when it is not directly applicable. Always be aware that the splitting of a coven breeds bad feelings (energy vortices?); this law was made chiefly for this reason. And may happier times come!

If you would keep a Book (whether it is called a Black Book, Book of Shadows, Book of Light, or whatever), write it in your own hand. Let your brothers and sisters in the Craft copy as they will from your book in their hand, but never let your Book out of your hands and never keep the writing of another. Every Witch should keep and guard their own writings, that none may be discovered through their Book being found in another's possession. Destroy your Book whenever danger threatens, and commit as many as possible of these Laws to memory. Destroy the writings of a deceased Witch if they did not have time to do so themselves. If any of their writings are found, it is clear proof against both the writer and the holder, for our enemies firmly believe that "one may not be a Witch alone": their family and all who are known to be friends may be suspected as Witches. Be responsible with your writings and you will protect all who love you.

If your Book is found on you, it is clear proof against you alone unless you tell our enemies what you know. You may be taken and tortured, but keep all thoughts of the Craft from your mind. If the torture is too much to bear, tell them, "I cannot bear this torture. I will confess. What do you want me to say?" If they try to make you talk about the Craft, do not; but if they try to make you speak of absurd things, such as flying through the air, consorting with the Christian devil, sacrificing children, or eating men's flesh, say, "I held an evil dream; I was beside myself; I was crazed," or words to that effect, to obtain relief from the torture. Not all magistrates are bad -- if there is any semblance of an excuse, they may show mercy. If you have confessed to anything, deny it afterward: say that you babbled under torture, or that you don't remember what you said. If you are condemned, do not be afraid, for the Craft is powerful and your escape will be aided if you stand fast. If you go steadfast to the flames, be certain that drugs will reach you and you will feel nothing of the pain. You will only go to death and what lies beyond -- the ecstasy of the God and the Goddess. If you betray anything, however, there is no hope for you in this life or that which is to come.

To avoid being discovered, choose your working tools to be ordinary items which you would have around the house. Make your Pentacles out of wax so that you can break and melt them at once. Do not keep a sword unless its presence would alarm no one. Have no signs or names visible on anything. Write the signs in ink or water immediately before consecrating the tool and wash them off immediately after. Do not engrave anything, for this will only help you be discovered. Keep your athame and kerfan (working knife) among your kitchen knives, and let the colors of the hilts determine the one from the other and from the other knives.

Always remember that we are the Hidden Children of the Goddess. Never do anything to disgrace the Craft or Her -- never boast, never threaten, and never say that you wish ill of anyone. It is not forbidden to say, "There is Witchcraft in the land," for the Christians say so themselves and have made it heresy not to believe so; but always say, "I know nothing of it here, though it may be elsewhere." If any person speaks about the Craft outside of the Circle, say, "Don't speak of such things -- it frightens me. It is bad luck to talk about such things." Say this for this reason: the Christians have their spies everywhere. These spies have been known to talk as if they were drawn to the Craft and as if they would want to come to our meetings, and they say such things as, "My fathers and forefathers worshipped the Old Ones, and my mother; I would like to worship in this way myself." To all of these, tell them that you do not know what they are talking about, and that you wish they would stop. But to others, say, "It's silly to talk about Witches flying around in the air; they would have to be lighter than feathers or thistle-down. Besides, everyone knows that Witches are all bleary-eyed old hags; what fun could they possibly have at their meetings, and why should I want to participate? And besides, you know we were taught in school that there are no such things as Witches." Always make fun of the subject, that we may worship in peace when the persecution ends: let us all work for that happy time. May the blessing of the God and the Goddess be upon all who keep this law.

If any in the Craft holds any property, let all Witches guard it and keep it clear and good for the use of the Craft. It is the further responsibility of all Witches to guard Craft funds wisely. If any Witch offers a well-made item, it is proper to pay them for it according to the value of the work; this is not taking money for the Craft, but payment for honest work -- even the Christians believe that "the laborer is worth his hire." Still, if any Witch works willingly for the good of the Craft and will not accept payment, this shall be to their greater honor.

It is known that a coven may be bound together by sexual ties, and that this is often not desirable. When it is found that this is not desirable, the coven should be made up of loving couples, and there may also be single coveners. In such cases, it is required that the search for new love be undertaken outside the coven except when two single coveners find love with each other; otherwise, it will often cause division in the coven. For while all acts of love and pleasure are indeed the rituals of our beloved Goddess, She is not inclined to favor acts which divide Her covens and scatter Her Witches unnecessarily.

If there should arise quarrels or disputes among the Witches, the High Priestess or High Priest shall immediately convene the elders and inquire into the problem. The elders shall hear each side separately, and then both together. Their decision should be just, not siding with one side until the matter is determined, recognizing that there are people who cannot work under others, and others who cannot make wise decisions. To those who must always be in charge, the possible solutions for them are to void the coven altogether, find another coven for them, or for them to found a new coven (taking with them all who will go). To those who cannot rule wisely, the solution is that those who cannot bear the rule will leave the coven. No one can truly worship the Gods when personal conflicts among the coveners are not resolved; all who cause strife in the coven must be told, "Go away from us, for the Craft must ever survive."

In the Old Days, we could use the Art against anyone who treated the Witches badly; but in these times, we must not do so. Our enemies have invented a burning pit of everlasting fire into which their God throws everyone who does not worship Him, except for those few who buy their penance from His priests (for their God always seems to be in need of money). Even as our Gods need our aid to make fertility for people and crops, so it is that the God of the Christians is always needing men to find and destroy us. Their priests tell them that any man who is helped by us will be damned to their Hell forever, to the point that men are mad with the terror of it. But the priests also make them believe that they may escape this Hell if they give up Witches to be tortured, so that these men are always thinking, "If I catch only one Witch, I will escape the fiery pit." For this reason we have our hiding places, and when no Witches are found, the searchers will say, "There aren't any Witches, or at least not in this area." But as soon as one of our oppressors dies or even catches a cold, the cry will go up that it is "Witches' work," and the hunt will be on again. And while they may kill ten Christians for every Witch, they will not care, for they are countless millions while we are few indeed.

Therefore, it is ordained that none shall use the Art in any way to harm anyone or even wish them ill. However much they may injure us, harm none, and may the Christians forget that we exist. These laws are ordained to help us in our difficulties. No person, no matter how large the injury or injustice they incur, may use the Art in any way to do evil or harm anyone. But they may use the Art, after great consultation with the elders and fellow coveners, to keep the Christians and their tools from harming anyone -- but only to constrain them. To this end, some day men will say "That man says he is a mighty persecutor of Witches, but all we ever see him torture are old women -- we cannot see that they have hurt anyone, and if they are all such powerful Witches, why has he not been harmed?" They will see him as the evil person he is, regardless of his professed beliefs.

We know that too many people have died because someone had a grudge against them, or were persecuted because another wanted their wealth or because they were too poor to bribe the witch-hunters. And many have died only for being old women -- so many that most men now seem to believe that only old women are Witches. This is to our advantage, for it turns many suspicious eyes away from us; but we mourn deeply for the old women. Still, in England and Scotland, it has been hundreds of years since a Witch "died the death"; be vigilant, for the misuse of our power might begin the persecutions again. Never break this law, no matter how much you are tempted. Never consent to the breaking of this law: even a High Priestess who merely consents to the breaking of this law must be deposed immediately, for it is the blood of all the Witches that she endangers. Do only good, and then only when it is safe to do anything at all.

Never accept money for the use of the Art, for money always smudges the receiver. Christians take money for the use of their arts, and they sell pot-metal charms, pardons, and potions to men so that they may escape from their sins. Do not act like these; as long as you refuse to take money, you will be free from the temptation to use the Art for evil causes. All may use the Art for their own advantage or for the advantage of the Craft, but you must always be certain that no one will be harmed by its use. Let the coven debate the use of the Art at length, and only when all are satisfied that none will be harmed by its use will the use be allowed. Remember that if you cannot achieve your means in one fashion, your aim may still be reached through another -- always harming none. If anyone in the Craft needs a house or land and there is no one willing to sell to them, you may use the Art to incline an owner's mind to be willing to sell, provided that the spell does not harm the owner or the property and that the full value is paid without haggling. Never bargain or cheapen anything while living by the Art.

The most important of laws: Do nothing that will endanger anyone in the Craft or which will bring them into conflict with the law of the land or any of our persecutors. In this regard, it is never permissible, in any dispute involving the Craft, to invoke any laws other than those of the Craft, nor may any tribunals be held other than one consisting of the High Priestess, the High Priest, and the elders.

The coven is to keep two books on herbalism. One of these will list the names and uses of all herbs which are cures for ills or are otherwise good for humans, and all may have access to this book to learn these things. But keep a separate book with the names of all poisonous herbs and those used in dark spells, letting only the elders and other trusted Witches know of these secrets or even of this book's existence.

Remember that the Art is the secret of the Gods and may only be used in earnest -- never for show, or pride, or personal glory. The Christians may taunt you saying, "You have no power: Perform some magic for us, and then we may believe." Do not listen to them, for the Art is holy and is to be used only in need.

It has always been the way of men and women that they should seek after love, and while no one should be reproved for this, it may be to the disadvantage of the Craft sometimes. It has happened too many times that a High Priestess has found a new love and run off with him, giving no word to the coven of this. A High Priestess may resign in full coven at any time, and this resignation is valid; but if she has not resigned, the coven shall wait for her to return for a year and a day (for she may return sooner, having left for love). If she has a deputy, that deputy is to act as Priestess for as long as the High Priestess is away. If she returns within this time, all will be as if she had never left; but if she does not return within this timeIn the Magic Circle, the words, commands, and wishes of the High Priestess are Law. She is the earthly representative of our gracious Goddess and is to be obeyed and respected in all things. She is our Lady and, above all others, a Queen in the highest sense of the word. All female coveners will curtsy and say "Blessed Be" when they come before Her, and all male coveners will bend their knee, kiss Her on the right cheek, and say "Blessed Be."

But keep a separate book with the names of all poisonous herbs and those used in dark spells, letting only the elders and other trusted Witches know of these secrets or even of this book's existence.

Remember that the Art is the secret of the Gods and may only be used in earnest -- never for show, or pride, or personal glory. The Christians may taunt you saying, "You have no power: Perform some magic for us, and then we may believe." Do not listen to them, for the Art is holy and is to be used only in need.

It has always been the way of men and women that they should seek after love, and while no one should be reproved for this, it may be to the disadvantage of the Craft sometimes. It has happened too many times that a High Priestess has found a new love and run off with him, giving no word to the coven of this. A High Priestess may resign in full coven at any time, and this resignation is valid; but if she has not resigned, the coven shall wait for her to return for a year and a day (for she may return sooner, having left for love). If she has a deputy, that deputy is to act as Priestess for as long as the High Priestess is away. If she returns within this time, all will be as if she had never left; but if she does not return within thisIn August 9, 1959, Gerald Gardner received a letter from Carl Weschcke, owner and CEO of the American occult publishing house, Llewellyn. Carl, having read Gardner's books, had written to ask him if he had any knowledge about a device called the 'witches cradle' which he had seen mentioned in William Seabrook's book Witchcraft, Its Power and Influence Today. The 'witches cradle' was a suspended 'cage' that purportedly heightened psychic sensitivity through the use of restraints, combined with a monotonous swinging motion. Gardner replied that he had not come across such a contraption, or its use in the Craft, and went on to say, "I have asked many of the older witches, and none of them had ever heard of it." After a few more letters had been exchanged, Gardner referred Carl to several other people including Margaret Bruce and Charles Clark, for further discussion.

Carl first wrote to Charles in 1961, the beginning of an exchange that was to last about 20 years. In one letter from 1968, Charles mentioned to Carl that he had "some copies of the late G. B. Gardner's Rituals that he sent me [Charles] for opinions from time to time," and wondered if Carl would be interested in them. When Gardner had still been alive, Charles and he had discussed the publication of material and Gerald had agreed that this may help people better understand the Craft, and what it was about. Consequently, Charles packaged the papers up and sent them to Carl in April 1969. Extracts from them were published in Llewellyn's magazine Gnostica, but they really came to light when Aidan Kelly obtained photocopies and subsequently wrote about them in his book Crafting The Art of Magic, where the term 'Weschcke Documents' was first coined.

The 'Weschcke Documents' are a collection of papers consisting of 38 typed pages of 'Gardnerian' ritual material, including all eight Sabbats, 'The Old Laws', three ways of forming the circle, 'To Gain the Sight', 'The Eightfold Way', the three degrees, consecrations, various versions of The Charge and Amalthean Horn, as well as a copy of 'The Witches Chant' (which many now know as 'The Witches Rune'). Many of them also have handwritten amendments on them, in what appears in most cases, to be Gerald Gardner's own handwriting. During the 1950s, documents like these were sometimes sent to new initiates for them to copy into their own personal Books of Shadows.

Those of you who have seen Gerald's writing will know what a 'scrawler' he was, and how bad his spelling appears to have been. Aidan Kelly suggests that he was marginally dyslexic, Philip Heselton considers Gardner's poor English and phonetic way of spelling, to be a consequence of his lack of formal education, and Ronald Hutton has suggested that Gardner's 'aberrant spelling' was an attempt by him to make things look more archaic. I personally think the latter is unlikely as Gardner displays similar traits in his personal correspondence.

These typed documents, whilst obviously easier to read, also exhibit similar poor spelling. A further 'quirk' of Gardner's (in a time before text messaging) was his penchant for abbreviating words. For example, he would sometimes put 'wd' for 'would' and 'shd' in place of 'should'. Furthermore, he had a peculiar habit of using a typewriter's small case 'l' instead of correctly using a capital 'I'; in some instances he even uses a capital 'L' for 'I', and it is not unusual to see a mix of both in the same document. As with so many things Gardner-related, he was never completely consistent in his lackadaisicalness, something that I think is quite frustrating for Craft historians!

Of the various documents, I think one of the more interesting ones is entitled 'All Are Purified' (subtitled 'Ceremony for working with others'). This is essentially a way of casting the circle that starts off with a conjuration of the sword. If we look at the following passage, taken from Gardner's 1954 book Witchcraft Today, I think we can see where the slightly unusual title may hail from: "When drawn, this circle is carefully purified, as also are all who celebrate the rites. Witches attach great importance to this, for within the circle is the gods' domain." With regards to what is being implied by the subheading 'Ceremony for working with others' there may be a clue in the crossed-out section which refers to '13 candles'. As 13 is the traditional number in a Coven, could the reference to working with 'others' mean working with Coveners as opposed to working alone, or with just a working partner? In view of Gardner's earlier works (which we will come to shortly) where the focus seems to have been more on individuals as opposed to Covens, this explanation seems to be likely. However, just to discombobulate things further, and for the sake of completion, I should also draw attention to the fact that the crossed-out section bears a strong resemblance to the beginning of the Yule ritual, thus adding a further nebulous dimension to consider in any final understanding of this document.

She then opens her arms to the Pentacle position and says, "Bow before my Spirit Bright." All bow. The High Priestess continues, "Aphrodite, Arianrhod; Lover of the Horned God, Queen of Witchery & Night."

Magus kneeling in front of her, draws Pentacle on her body with P Headed Wand, Invokes, (Drawing down the Moon,) "I Invoke and Beseech Thee, O Mighty MOTHER of all life and fertility. By seed and root, by stem and bud, by leaf and flower and fruit, By Life & Love -do I invoke Thee to descend into the body of thy servant and H.Ps..."The Moon having been drawn down, the Magus and all Male Officers give five salutes, while all others bow. The assembly forms a semi-circle at the north of the Altar, with the High Priestess in the south. She inserts the point of the Sword or Athame into a decorated bundle of 13 candles, saying, "I the Mother, Darksome and Divine, Mine the Scourge and Mine the Kiss, The Five Point Star of Love and Bliss; Here I charge ye in this Sign." She then opens her arms to the Pentacle position and says, "Bow before my Spirit Bright." All bow, and she continues, "Aphrodite, Arianrhod; Lover of the Horned God, Queen of Witchery & Night." The ritual appears to continue, although the next page is not in the collection.Raise the volume of the "Aum" slightly. The High Priest/ess asks, "And do you swear to keep silent all those things that must be kept silent and to respect that which is taught to you?" The Initiate responds, "I willingly swear to keep silent all that must be kept silent and to respect that which is taught to me. So mote it be." All others raise the volume of the "Aum" a little more. The High Priest/ess continues, "And by what surety do you swear all of these things?" The Initiate replies, "All of these things I do swear, by my mother's womb and my hope of future lives, knowing well that my Measure has been taken in the presence of the Mighty Ones. Should I fail utterly in my oaths, may my powers desert me, and may my own tools turn against me. So mote it be. So mote it be. So mote it be!" All yell quickly, "SO MOTE IT BE!"

Triggering of the Spell: All grab the Initiate quickly and hoist them completely into the air (if possible), chanting the Initiate's new name over and over again, as fast as possible, as they carry them three times quickly around the circle. When they return to the starting point, they set them down face-down and press them firmly into the ground. Gradually, the pressure relents to a gentle massage. Through all of this, they continue chanting the Initiate's new name, falling off in volume and speed as the pressure relaxes. The High Priest/ess says, "Know that the hands that have touched you are the hands of love." They remove the Initiate's blindfold and help them up. "In the Burning Times, when each member of the Coven held the lives of the others in their hand, this would have been kept and used against you should you endanger others. But in these happier times, love and trust prevail, so take this (hands the Measure to the Initiate), keep it or burn it, and be free to go or stay as you please."

Follow-through and Earthing of Power: The High Priest/ess hands the sword to the Initiate and leads them to the East, where they both kneel. The Initiate salutes and the High Priest/ess announces, "Behold, restless Spirits of Water -- I bring before you <new name>, who has been consecrated as Priest/ess and Witch!" This is repeated at the South, West, and finally North. All, including the High Priest/ess and Initiate, join hands in the Circle. The High Priest/ess says, "Thank you Spirits of the Mighty Dead, Spirits of the Four Elements, and awesome Lord and Lady for hallowing our circle. Go or stay as you will -- our circle is ended." All ground and center, then absorb the power of the Circle and return it to the Earth beneath their feet. After a suitable pause, the High Priest/ess concludes, "Our lovely rite draws to its end. Merry meet, merry part, and merry meet again. Blessed Be!" All respond, "BLESSED BE!"The High Priest/ess asked the initiate if they swore to keep silent about all things that must be kept silent and to respect what is taught. The initiate willingly swore to keep silent and respect the teachings. The High Priest/ess then asked by what surety the initiate swore these things. The initiate swore by their mother's womb and hope of future lives, knowing their Measure had been taken in the presence of the Mighty Ones. They declared that if they failed in their oaths, their powers would desert them, and their own tools would turn against them. The assembly yelled, "So mote it be!" The initiate was then hoisted into the air, carried around the circle while chanting their new name, and set down face-down, pressed into the ground, and gradually massaged. The High Priest/ess removed the blindfold, helped the initiate up, and explained that the hands that touched them were hands of love. The initiate was given the Measure to keep or burn and was free to go or stay. The High Priest/ess led the initiate to the East, where they both knelt, and the initiate was introduced to the Spirits of Water, Fire, Earth, and Air. The assembly joined hands, thanked the Spirits, and ended the circle with "Blessed Be!"Harpocrates, the Egyptian god, was mistakenly believed to pertain to silence because his finger or thumb was touching his lips. This gesture is now believed to be a symbol of childhood; this correction appears in the World card of Crowley's "Book of Thoth" Tarot deck. Harpocrates was the god of the Sun at dawn, symbolizing wonder, beauty, potential, and growth. The "hush" gesture of the Golden Dawn Sign of Silence is adequate for the modern occultist, even if deprived of a divine identification. It is a common gesture, at least in European culture, meaning silence. Silence perhaps balances the ultra-active Sign of the Enterer better than the more scholarly positive/active "Sign of Harpocrates the Rising Sun," and silence is surely no alien concept to mystics. The pentagrams are given form by the drawing, life by the vibration, and identity by the four-part prayer of steps. Some people do very elaborate visualizations of angelic guardians. Because of my personal deficiencies, I am content with strong feelings of presence, identity, and divinity in each of the four directions. A horizontal cross is built up step by step as you say, "Before me Raphael," etc., with you at the center; and the position of your arms forms a vertical cross, a renewal of the Qabalistic Cross from the start of the ritual. You may feel a peculiar rising and expansion when both of these crosses are formulated. One becomes the center of the geometry of the space, like a little world in itself, cut adrift from the mundane currents of everyday experience. The real banishing takes place during "For about me flames the pentagram, and in the column stands the six-rayed star." A great pulse of force is emitted during these steps, imposing the personal will on the space and clearing it of all hostile influences. After this is done, the invoked "archangels" maintain the banishing effect, guarding in all four directions. The importance lies in the psychological effect. The "feeling of cleanliness" is what matters. The final Qabalistic Cross is an affirmation of the completeness and symmetry of the ritual, and also a new self-consecration. This is more efficacious than the previous Cross because it is done in a banished environment. One is now ready to do a formal invocation, an evocation, a meditation, or whatever the overall purpose may be. The LBR is a preliminary ceremony, although it has a beneficial effect in itself. It can be done as a stand-alone ritual, but you should move on. The LBR should keep away the horrible ickies that turn so many novices away from Magick. Its mastery is a first step to adeptship.Harpocrates, the Egyptian god, was mistakenly believed to pertain to silence because his finger or thumb was touching his lips.

Its mastery is a first step to adeptship.Within the coven, a Matriarchy exists, with the High Priestess generally being considered the leader. The typical Gardnerian view of the God/dess is that of a Dominant Three-Faced Goddess (Maid, Mother, and Crone) with a Male Consort (the Young Summer King and the Old Winter King). Ceremonies include initiations into higher levels of the Craft and various Holiday Celebrations based on the "Wheel of the Year" calendar of Feast days.

Alexandrian: Started around the same time as Gardner's, this tradition is similar but emphasizes Ceremonial Magick. There are numerous Covens in both the US and Europe.

Dianic: This is more of a sub-class rather than a particular Tradition. Several Feminist Traditions are considered Dianic, emphasizing the Female aspect of the Goddess, sometimes excluding the Male God. These groups tend to be more politically active.

School of Wicca: Headed by Gavin and Yvonne Frost, this School is the largest correspondence school of Witchcraft in the US. Numerous Covens have resulted from this School, although it is somewhat unconventional. The Frosts' views on Wicca differ from the majority, as they do not consider Wicca as "Pagan" but rather as Monotheistic.

Seax (or Saxon) Wicca: Started by Raymond Buckland as an alternative to existing Covens. Unlike most traditions, which consider the Coven group to be the normal unit of division, the Seax version has provisions for lone witches (Solitaires). It allows for self-initiation and the auto setup of a Coven.

Traditionalist (Welsh, Scots, Greek, Irish, etc.): Each Traditionalist group is based on the traditions, literature, myth, and folktales of a particular geographic/demographic area. This is evident in the Names of the God/dess used by individual groups.

Common ties/beliefs/Ideals: The Wiccan Rede: "An it harms none, do what thou will." Most groups tend to be polytheistic, animists, pantheists, etc. One is not "converted" to Wicca; rather, the newcomer feels a sense of "Coming Home." Nature plays a big part in most Traditions. There is no counterpart to the Devil in Pagan religions. The Law of Three Fold Return states, "That which thou dost send out shall return threefold."

HurnWithin the coven, a Matriarchy exists, with the High Priestess generally being considered the leader. The typical Gardnerian view of the God/dess is that of a Dominant Three-Faced Goddess (Maid, Mother, and Crone) with a Male Consort (Who has two sides: the Young Summer King and the Old Winter King). Ceremonies include a series of initiations into higher levels of the Craft and various Holiday Celebrations based on the "Wheel of the Year" calendar of Feast days.

Alexandrian: Started about the same time as Gardner's, this tradition is fairly similar, with a little more emphasis on Ceremonial Magick. There are numerous Covens in both the US and Europe.

Dianic: This is more of a Sub-class rather than a particular Tradition. There are several Feminist Traditions considered Dianic. This sub-class tends to emphasize the Female aspect of the Goddess, sometimes to the exclusion of the Male God. Some feel that these groups are rather reactionary and self-limiting. Be that as it may, the Dianic Covens tend to be more politically active.

The Frosts' views on Wicca as a religion differ from the majority in that they do not consider Wicca as "Pagan" but rather as Monotheistic.

Seax (or Saxon) Wicca: Started by Raymond Buckland, who was originally a leader in promoting the Gardnerian Tradition, as an alternative to the existing Covens. Unlike most traditions, which consider the Coven group to be the normal unit of division, the Seax version has provision for lone witches (often referred to as Solitaires). Another thing which sets this particular brand apart is its non-reliance upon being properly initiated into the Wiccan community. Many of the other groups require that new members be brought to existing covens to be ceremonially initiated into that Tradition, and that only after years of study within the group is one ready to start a new coven. The Seax tradition, recognizing that there may not be a friendly, neighborhood Coven, allows for self-initiation and Auto setup of a Coven.

Traditionalist (Welsh, Scots, Greek, Irish, etc.): Like Dianic, this is a sub-class. Each Traditionalist group is based upon the traditions, literature, myth, and folktales of that particular geographic/demographic area. This is evident in the Names of the God/dess used by individual groups.

Common ties/beliefs/Ideals: It's not doctrine/dogma similarities which tend to hold these diverse groups together, rather, it is the common Ideals and feelings expressed by the Pagan Peoples themselves. Here are some examples: The Wiccan Rede: "An it harms none, do what thou will." is almost universally accepted amongst the groups. Most groups tend to be polytheistic, animists, pantheists, etc. One is not "converted" to Wicca, rather, the newcomer feels a sense of "Coming Home," or, more poetically, "The Goddess calls to Her own." Nature plays a big part in most Traditions, either as a direct personification of the God/dess or as aspects of them. There is no counterpart to the Devil, as such, in the Pagan religions... no personification of All Evil, rather, the choice is there for all to make. However, there is the Law of Three Fold Return, which states "That which thou dost send out shall return threefold," so good begets good, and evil befalls those who are evil.We value sex as pleasure, as the symbol and embodiment of life, and as one of the sources of energies used in magickal practice and religious worship. We recognize both outer worlds and inner, or psychological, worlds sometimes known as the Spiritual World, the Collective Unconscious, Inner Planes, etc. We see in the interaction of these two dimensions the basis for paranormal phenomena and magickal exercises. We neglect neither dimension for the other, seeing both as necessary for our fulfillment. We do not recognize any authoritarian hierarchy, but do honor those who teach, respect those who share their greater knowledge and wisdom, and acknowledge those who have courageously given of themselves in leadership. We see religion, magick, and wisdom in living as being united in the way one views the world and lives within it—a worldview and philosophy of life which we identify as Witchcraft—the Wiccan Way. Calling oneself "Witch" does not make a Witch—neither does heredity itself, nor the collecting of titles, degrees, and initiations. A Witch seeks to control the forces within herself/himself that make life possible in order to live wisely and well without harm to others and in harmony with Nature. We believe in the affirmation and fulfillment of life in a continuation of evolution and development of consciousness, giving meaning to the Universe we know and our personal role within it. Our only animosity towards Christianity, or towards any other religion or philosophy of life, is to the extent that its institutions have claimed to be "the only way" and have sought to deny freedom to others and to suppress other ways of religious practice and belief. As American Witches, we are not threatened by debates on the history of the Craft, the origins of various terms, or the legitimacy of various aspects of different traditions. We are concerned with our present and our future. We do not accept the concept of absolute evil, nor do we worship any entity known as "Satan" or "the Devil," as defined by the Christian traditions. We do not seek power through the suffering of others, nor accept that personal benefit can be derived only by denial to another. We believe that we should seek within Nature that which is contributory to our health and wellbeing.We value sex as pleasure, as the symbol and embodiment of life, and as one of the sources of energies used in magickal practice and religious worship.

I am quite aware of the fact that this is a loaded subject. It is one of the oldest disciplines in occultism and virtually every magic tradition applies it somewhere down the road. Yet it has always been regarded as the innermost secret discipline. Witches, Shamans, Runesters, Yogis, and Magicians of all varieties work with it in one form or another. To build up, strengthen, direct, and aim this powerful energy is an awesome magical tool, as anyone who has ever worked with it knows. Being limited in time and space, but having such a wonderful and eclectic medium to work with, I want to give you a few unbiased ideas on the subject.

No discipline of magic has attracted as much mumbo jumbo or misinformation as sex magic does. Nothing stirs the mind more than the left and right of the so-called middle path quite as vividly. Nothing is more ancient, powerful, and misunderstood as Sex magic. Yes, the market on Tantra is booming, as a visit to any occult book shop will show you. Yet well-researched, practical introductions into sex magic are virtually non-existent. Male sexist tunnel vision abounds.

One of the reasons being that the general approach towards sexuality and women is steeped in Judeo-Christian hang-ups. The most common approach seems to be: "Just lay down and be the altar dear, you are going to love it." Even such revolutionaries as Aleister Crowley have done very little to improve this. Louis Culling even dares to state in his contemporary work (1971), that a frigid woman is more conductive to sex magic practice than a sensual or, mind you, sexually aggressive one. For this would surely disturb one's concentration on the Great Work.

No wonder that there are few women attracted to these kinds of partners! You will always get what you want in magic and the so-called true will does reveal itself in strange ways. Doing some soul searching and clarifying your motives is quite effective.

Now, regarding literature on this subject there is hope. My German friend Fra.: U.D. has written a comprehensive, pragmatic book on sex magic. Its title is "Secrets of the German Sex Magicians" (Llewellyn) and he told me last weekend that it is available in the States right now. (I hope he will give me some extracts to post them here...) It beats everything that has ever been published on the subject. Get it!

Now let me point out, one more time, that magic is a practical science. Merely reading about it or going to a workshop will not get you anywhere. The multitude of sexual expressions is just as great and manifold as human behavior in general. Here, like everywhere in Chaos Magic, it is useful to keep in mind that if it works for you, use it! Remember, the real sex magicians, male and female, have always known that and discarded social conditioning and taboos, right along with the do's and don'ts of dogma.

We do magic to liberate ourselves. So if it is possible for one thing to be sacred we logically conclude that everything else can be sacred too. Auto-, Hetero- and Homosexual expressions are equally valid in sex magic. It is more about expanding one's horizons than about finding a certain "right" way, partner, or ritual to do it. The Chaos Magical paradigm kicks right in: Nothing is True, and Everything is Permitted!

The next issue I want to address is the Auto-erotic practice. So let me state this loud and clear: Without auto-erotic practice it is impossible to achieve anything in Sex magic! Auto-eroticism is of central importance because it is the ideal practice and playground. It constitutes a powerful technique in itself, and it makes us independent of partners. Especially in the beginning, it is much easier to explore, prolong, and amplify orgasmic trance states. For this very same reason, it is possible to do effective sex magic with a partner who knows nothing about it but working with a partner who is equally trained in this art is ever so much more effective. Most amateurs believe that sexual magic is something that solely happens between partners in a ritual, but in reality, the vast majority of sex magical arts are performed auto-erotically.

Regarding the physical aspects of the sexual magical training first thing to consider is that your body is really _your temple_. And for it to be your ultimate tool and asset it has to be in peak condition. Physical and mental dependencies, be it alcohol, stimulants, or even tobacco, will interfere with your ability to develop and direct this tool. I do not want to project a moral attitude on this, or any other subject, but mind, spirit, and body are deeply intertwined. And the more you alter your mind from the outside by using drugs of any sort, the harder it gets to focus your will and physical reaction. If you are in a frizzy condition, you will get frizzy results! Here, as in all magic, the borders are fluid. A good training in practical magic will greatly enhance your sexual magic and vice versa.

A lot of physical exercises in sex magic derive from Tantra Yoga. The only point of disagreement appears to be the way of using the orgasm. In particular, the "traditional" Tantra authors seem to cling to the idea that there is only a limited amount of sperm available to men. Therefore this precious substance is carefully guarded, held back, and reassimilated when spent. Western magic does not agree with this belief. Its approach is rather like: the more you spend - the more you get! This applies to male magicians, women have always been pretty much inexhaustible in their orgasmic capacity. What joins both is that the intent in Sex magic is much more result-oriented and concrete than in Tantra, where it is mainly transcendental.

The longing for transcendence seems to be inherently natural in human behavior. Yet being western magicians living in the nineties we know that we have to handle the "real world", our physical reality first, and then we can move on to the loftier goals.

A good manual for your physical preparation and training is "Stalking the Wild Orgasm" by Christopher Scott Kilham. His work not only includes some excellent yoga exercises but also gives you some great clues regarding nutrition and aphrodisiacs.

When you get going in this direction you will find that it soon penetrates into many other areas of your magical work. You will be in better physical shape, more relaxed, focused, and grounded. Magic is a gut-level art. We have to remove it from the intellectual stuff. Trust your own experiences. Strive to conduct your magic work from this part of your body where all magic originates - your loins. Have fun!In this article, I would like to address the issue of sex and magic.

With fractalic greetings and laughter.The concept of change is explored through the sephira Gevurah, which balances creation and destruction. Change often requires the destruction of existing forms, such as cutting down a tree to make paper or abolishing a culture to end slavery. Gevurah represents strict judgment and resistance to change, akin to an immune system within the body of God. A balance between creation and destruction is necessary, as too much change can lead to chaos, while too little can stifle growth. This balance is embodied in the sephira Tiphereth, which represents an instinctive morality and a sense of justice. Tiphereth is not present by default in everyone but can be developed through initiation. The creative impulse, after passing through Gevurah and Tiphereth, gains energy in Netzach, where it manifests as vital urges and emotions. Netzach is pre-verbal and represents the basic drives that compel us to act. The sephira Hod then gives shape to these urges through reason and communication, reflecting the intelligence of God. The synthesis of Hod and Netzach occurs in Yesod, the interface that realizes abstract forms in matter. Finally, in Malkuth, these forms become actualized in the physical world. The process of creation, described as the Lightning Flash, follows a path through the sephiroth, illustrating the journey from the hidden God to material change. This understanding of the sephiroth provides a framework for practical magic and spiritual growth.It can be for good or evil; a leader who can tap the petty malice and vindictiveness in any person and channel it into a vision of a new order and genocide is just as much a visionary as any other, but the positive side of Chesed is the humanitarian leader who brings about genuine improvements to our common life.

No change comes easy; as Cordova points out, "everything wishes to remain what it is." The creation of form is balanced in the sephira Gevurah by the preservation and destruction of form. Any impulse of change is channeled through Gevurah, and if it is not resisted then something will be destroyed. If you want to make paper you cut down a tree. If you want to abolish slavery you have to destroy the culture which perpetuates it. If you want to change someone's mind you have to destroy that person's beliefs about the matter in question. The sephira Gevurah is the quality of strict judgment which opposes change, destroys the unfamiliar, and corresponds in many ways to an immune system within the body of God.

There has to be a balance between creation and destruction. Too much change, too many ideas, too many things happening too quickly can have the quality of chaos (and can literally become that), whereas too little change, no new ideas, too much form and structure and protocol can suffocate and stifle. There has to be a balance which "makes sense" and this "idea of balance" or "making sense" is expressed in the sephira Tiphereth. It is an instinctive morality, and it isn't present by default in the human species. It isn't based on cultural norms; it doesn't have its roots in upbringing (although it is easily destroyed by it). Some people have it in a large measure, and some people are (to all intents and purposes) completely lacking in it. It doesn't necessarily respect conventional morality: it may laugh in its face. I can't say what it is in any detail, because it is peculiar and individual, but those who have it have a natural quality of integrity, soundness of judgment, an instinctive sense of rightness, justice and compassion, and a willingness to fight or suffer in defense of that sense of justice. Tiphereth is a paradoxical sephira because in many people it is simply not there. It can be developed, and that is one of the goals of initiation, but for many people Tiphereth is a room with nothing in it.

Having passed through Gevurah on the Pillar of Form, and found its way through the moral filter of Tiphereth, a creative impulse picks up energy once more on the Pillar of Force via the Sephira Netzach, where the energy of "becoming" finds its final expression in the form of "vital urges." Why do we carry on living? Why bother? What is it that compels us to do things? An artist may have a vision of a piece of art, but what actually compels the artist to paint or sculpt or write? Why do we want to compete and win? Why do we care what happens to others? The sephira Netzach expresses the basic vital creative urges in a form we can recognize as drives, feelings, and emotions. Netzach is pre-verbal; ask a child why he wants a toy and the answer will be "I just do." "But why," you ask, wondering why he doesn't want the much more "sensible" toy you had in mind. "Why don't you want this one here?" "I just don't. I want this one." "But what's so good about that one?" "I don't know what to say...I just like it."

This conversation is not fictitious and is quintessentially Netzach. The structure of the Tree of Life posits that the basic driving forces which characterize our behavior are pre-verbal and non-rational; anyone who has tried to change another person's basic nature or beliefs through force of rational argument will know this.

After Netzach we go to the sephira Hod to pick up our last cargo of Form. Ask a child why they want something and they say "I just do." Press an adult and you will get an earful of "reasons." We live in a culture where it is important (often essential) to give reasons for the things we do, and Hod is the sephira of form where it is possible to give shape to our wants in terms of reasons and explanations. Hod is the sephira of abstraction, reason, logic, language, and communication, and a reflection of the Mother of Form in the human mind. We have an innate capacity to abstract, to go immediately from the particular to the general, and we have an innate capacity to communicate these abstractions using language, and it should be clear why the alternative translation of Binah is "intelligence"; Binah is the "intelligence of God", and Hod underpins what we generally recognize as intelligence in people - the ability to grasp complex abstractions, reason about them, and articulate this understanding using some means of communication.

The synthesis of Hod and Netzach on the Pillar of Consciousness is the sephira Yesod. Yesod is the sephira of interface, and the comparison with computer peripheral interfaces is an excellent one. Yesod is sometimes called "the Receptacle of the Emanations", and it interfaces the emanations of all three pillars to the sephira Malkuth, and it is through Yesod that the final abstract form of something is realized in matter. Form in Yesod is no longer abstract; it is explicit, but not yet individual - that last quality is reserved for Malkuth alone. Yesod is like the mold in a bottle factory - the mold is a realization of the abstract idea "bottle" in so far as it expresses the shape of a particular bottle design in every detail, but it is not itself an individual bottle.

The final step in the process is the sephira Malkuth, where God becomes flesh, and every abstract form is realized in actuality, in the "real world". There is much to say about this, but I will keep it for later.The concept of change is explored through the sephira Gevurah, which balances creation and destruction. Change often requires the destruction of existing forms, such as cutting down a tree to make paper or abolishing a culture to end slavery.

This understanding of the sephiroth provides a framework for practical magic and spiritual growth.

The text continues to explore the concept of dimensions and paradigms. It discusses how different conditions can exist along a one-dimensional axis and how shifting to a two-dimensional paradigm introduces new conditions along the width. The model evolves to include height and depth, leading to the understanding that different conditions can exist at the same point in space at different times. The addition of time as a dimension allows for the observation of different conditions at the same point in space at different times. The text then speculates about the existence of a fifth dimension, called "E" or Ennead, where different conditions can exist at the same point in space and time but in different Enneads. This new dimension implies the parallel existence of different things and events, similar to mystic experiences and the concept of parallel worlds in the Kabbalah.

The text also explores the idea of other forms of existence, such as beings that lack the last dimension (time and movement) and exist in a reduced paradigm. It discusses how these beings might grow in space continuously and irreversibly, like plants or fungi. The text then considers beings that lack both area and spreading over a surface, existing only along a line, like solid objects. The text concludes with a meditation exercise to help understand the structure and reality of other dimensional existences and their relation to our own.

The text then shifts to a discussion of the Covenant of the Goddess, a non-profit religious organization founded in 1975 to increase cooperation among Witches and secure legal protection for Witches and covens. The Covenant publishes a newsletter, issues ministerial credentials, sponsors a national festival, and encourages networking. It is a confederation of covens and solitaires of various traditions who share in the worship of the Goddess and the Old Gods and subscribe to a common code of ethics. The text outlines the structure, code of ethics, confidentiality, newsletter, finances, membership criteria, and ministerial credentials of the Covenant.

The text also includes a pledge to Pagan spirituality, emphasizing the importance of channeling spiritual energy to help and heal oneself and others, respecting the diversity of nature, using psychic power wisely, creating positivity, acting honorably, and remaining strong and committed to spiritual ideals.

Finally, the text discusses the principles of the Craft, including the importance of love, harmony with the forces of the universe, the law of cause and effect, the interconnectedness of all things, the use of astrology, the existence of the life-force, and the practice of magick. The text emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior, personal responsibility, and the continuous evolution of the human potential.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

"f time and aeons". But let`s steer clear of speculation that would not be apt for a speck of dust. Resume: when every section of this way has its own distinct characteristic (not affectable by time, because time doesn’t exist), it is inconceivable for us that in some places other conditions along the same length in the same sector may exist, just to the right or left of the way. Don’t forget - right/left have not been invented yet!

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 289

Were it able to move left or right, if only slightly, it might be able to experience different conditions on the same spot of its one-dimensional axis (on a border, a corner, a different surface). But what lies outside its one-dimensional paradigm is unknowable. The model for this paradigm is, therefore, that along the dimension there can only be one condition at one spot.

Let’s shift now to a 2-dimensional paradigm. Now the first dimension and the 2nd can be used, and the room presents itself to us like a section with an even surface. Along the first dimension there are still the same conditions as before, but to the side (left/right) there are some more.

The model is changed as follows: along dimension 1 (length) there can be different conditions, but at different levels of dimension 2 (width). This new being acts in a more familiar manner as, like maps for example, it orients itself according to a horizontal and vertical axis.

You can guess how the riddle continues. We learn to move or grow up and down. Now different conditions are possible on the same surface coordinates but at different heights and depths. In the new paradigm there is only one condition at one point in space.

Finally, we shift to our normal paradigm by adding time. We can now observe different conditions at the same point of space at different times, and can formulate the paradigm as follows: At the same point in space only one object can exist at the same time. This is a long-established model of physics, matching perfectly our mechanical world and our senses.

In this mental experiment we have learned 2 things:
1. Moving along a dimension, one can recognize differences. This is the characteristic of a dimension, not its definition.
2. After each shift to the next dimension, the model (dogma) of the preceding one is superseded. Generally, the most recent dimension is a continuum, i.e., a dimension that goes irreversible in one direction. Our own paradigm model consists of the (old) 3 space dimensions plus the (new) time as a continuum. How could a world look like that contains one dimension more, the fifth one, called "E" or Ennead for example? (I think Ennead is an expression from a science fiction novel, but the Ancient Egyptians had a similar expression for the place where all possibilities exist that don’t exist here; or where all the possibilities manifest that are kept by us from manifesting in this world here.)

You can construct the new model dogma by yourself: at one and the same point of space and time there CAN be different conditions (objects, colors, temperatures...), but at a different Ennead(!!).

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 290

BUT: at the same point of space at the same time and Ennead, there is again only one condition (object etc.) possible! This game can theoretically be continued forever, but soon gets uninteresting, because everything becomes far-fetched.

The step to the next dimension implies several interesting changes because:
- first of all it calls for the parallel existence of different things and events, side-by-side and at the same spot of the space/time-paradigm. This sounds very much like the sometimes incomprehensible reports of mystic experiences, whether from contemporary times like the Seth-books, or long ago, like Meister Eckhart, Tauler or Seuse. It is also similar to the picture of the 4 worlds of the Kabbala which exists inside one another, and it makes certain Egyptian mysteries understandable.
- it makes a huge number of connections possible that we normally would not think of. Numerous events inexplicable by rational thinking may have their roots here, because causality is only valid in the exact space/time paradigm and loses its ultimate character the moment a new dimension is brought in.
- most probably, and here all thinking and imagination stops, it replaces the time continuum with a ubiquitous time dimension (like length, width and height in our paradigm) where we can move freely forwards and backwards - but always at the same Ennead. Again, this dimension shift doesn’t free us completely, it just opens a gate and makes the next border visible.

The question about the quality or sense of this new E-dimension remains unanswered. But our familiar dimensions also have no state or sense or quality; they just exist and make us feel that they exist by limitations of our sense of movement etc. Although we live in this system, we cannot give a real definition of it (should we really?), only some more or less mathematical explanations. We just experience that along a dimension something changes. Dimensions let things happen. We feel something has changed along a dimension and we measure it by looking for regular changes. We measure time by observing the regular movements of the sun and the earth, but with no feeling for their pure quality.

Also, a new dimension E would not change our world radically; its only effect to our paradigm would be that some additional things happened - miraculously side-by-side in time. But as we have no sensors for this, it would be totally imperceptible. And should a short impression slip through, it would be instantly erased by our mind’s censor. Moreover, if some of us should get to this dimension it would prove nearly impossible to explain it to others; having no common language, comparisons or symbols for it.

This mental experiment has done its job, if we have achieved a feeling for what supradimensionality could be. Our paradigm is not the ultimate possibility, others exist - in between!

Other Forms of Existence:
Anyone used to observing nature from the heart, will have seen that it doesn’t like to have jumps in it; especially when it is only to be fitted into an artificial theoretical system of the human brain’s. Therefore, it is not consequent to assume that our paradigm of a space+time-continuum is the only valid system. The motto cannot be: "either you are with us in our system, or you are non-existent!" - a logical chain that we tend to follow all too often. If there are more simple dimensional systems, they will surely have their inhabitants. However, the creative amongst you should refrain from designing flat monsters for a 2-dimensional world now. As explained before, this all exists in our world, one in the other!

Again a little mental experiment may show us the way. Let’s imagine the following:
1. We put away all conditions related to the last dimension, the continuum. At the same time the last-but-one dimension becomes the continuum automatically, as explained before, because the last dimension always is a continuum (!!). It is interesting that our time-continuum physically is related only to movement, which means that everything able to move freely can experience time. (As stated here, the gift that our space+time paradigm gives to us is motion. Now, in Ancient Egypt, a very important symbol was the Ankh, meanings originally a sandal’s belt (scientists say). So, the meaning of the respective hieroglyph means "TO WALK". On Egyptian pictures, when a GOD gives life to a HUMAN he hands an ANKH to him, i.e. giving him LIFE = TO WALK = MOVEMENT.)

So we ignore everything that has to do with motion. And the space becomes continuum.
2. We look for forms of existing lacking exactly that last paradigm element, i.e., (in our case) time and movement.
That means we are looking for something that fulfills the picture of this reduced paradigm. In our previous example: something that doesn’t move, but spreads in space continuously and irreversibly. Just let the picture grow before thinking further; that’s it - GROWING! Anything that grows steadily and cannot shrink deliberately.

We may think of plants growing, clouds rising, micro-organism, fungi etc. For example, a tree starts from an exact point in space (the seed) and spreads evenly according to a distinct blueprint. Its size, especially the section rings of its stem, correlate exactly with its age; that means spatial growing and age match exactly. It cannot shrink definitely; it is able to drop leaves or branches, but they soon grow back to make it fill the same space occupied before. The process of spatial growth is irreversible. A harrowing thought - most probably we "grow" through time in the same manner! Maybe, even like some herbs or grass that die off in Autumn and grow again in the Spring - a picturesque allegory of death and rebirth!

For our next example we again take one dimension less. Now there is no free (active) motion and no growth in space. The continuum is the surface. A much more tricky paradigm. Something existing here must have the tendency to spread in surface as much as possible and never contract again deliberately. Hmmm.. what’s the biggest surface on earth? Of course, water! Water, as a liquid, can be formed freely, as it has no fixed form and will mold itself to fit any surface. But it cannot be compressed, and has the tendency to fill a space from beneath with the maximum of even surface at the same time. The gain with this form of existence is in the changeability of form - its flexibility and adaptability. The picture for this is the ocean, the river, or organisms like lichens which exist in clumps or patches.

Our next move is one more step towards reduction of existence. Now there is no area and no spreading over a surface. The continuum is dimension 1, the line, and everything else is fixed. In this paradigm all solid objects exist. Changes, if any, are only allowed along one line and are irreversible as in falling towards a center of gravity for example, or rolling down a slope. This dimension 1 does not have to be a straight line, but is the most efficient and best way of coming nearer to the center of attraction. Irreversible.

It’s interesting to see that we humans still align our orientation in space according to these same systems as described. The vertical line is a solid object hanging down, the plumb-rule; the horizontal surface, the level, is adjusted by hydrostatic balance (with water!). And the only independent (i.e., not geodetic) system for measuring height is an instrument derived from a barometer (the altigraph), which works on the basis of the expansion and reduction of a specific gas volume in a sealed shell.

These thoughts are certainly a little bit hard to chew on, but I’m sure they give enough themes for meditation.

Here’s an example for a simple meditation; freestyle of course. Get yourself into a trance-journey somehow. You may use a shamanic technique or jump through a Tattwa sign or whatever you prefer and are best used to. Let’s take the water element for example. According to classical technique, you imagine the horizontal syrinx sign and go through it (but in silver and not in green as usual when you want to explore the water world) and become the water yourself. Try to let the feeling flow freely. Flow down, spread, split into drops while breaking on a stone that lies in the water way; flow down as a torrent etc.; trickle to the ground; evaporate to the sky; experience total passivity in the respect of controlled growth or active motion. Be totally passive! It is important to collect oneself after this meditation and perform a thorough earthing. This exercise is comparatively easy with the water element. It is also possible with the 3-dimensional system (plant or cloud), but more complicated, or with the 1-dimensional system (solid object), but the latter takes a long time in my experience.

The purpose of this exercise is to get a feeling for the structure and physical reality of other dimensional existence and their relation with other systems, and to comprehend that these need not be projected to distant universes, but really exist in our world and that we meet them every day.

For people dealing with magic it is of immense value to get the right feeling of the existence of one universe in the other, and to be able to shift from a low dimensional system to a supradimensional system and vice versa. This is because we face many phenomena reaching into our paradigm from other systems. For example, severe distortions of reality go hand-in-hand with deep trance, (lucid) dreams and precognition. These all make our reality and our normal environment appear more or less different from normal experience: for example, when we experience our home in dream reality or on a mental journey, the table in the room isn’t where it normally used to be or maybe the window is on another wall and looks into a different landscape etc. All this is due to distortions along the 5th dimension (the Ennead as I named it provisionally).

Previous Content: The concept of change is explored through the sephira Gevurah, which balances creation and destruction. Change often requires the destruction of existing forms, such as cutting down a tree to make paper or abolishing a culture to end slavery. Gevurah represents strict judgment and resistance to change, akin to an immune system within the body of God. A balance between creation and destruction is necessary, as too much change can lead to chaos, while too little can stifle growth. This balance is embodied in the sephira Tiphereth, which represents an instinctive morality and a sense of justice. Tiphereth is not present by default in everyone but can be developed through initiation. The creative impulse, after passing through Gevurah and Tiphereth, gains energy in Netzach, where it manifests as vital urges and emotions. Netzach is pre-verbal and represents the basic drives that compel us to act. The sephira Hod then gives shape to these urges through reason and communication, reflecting the intelligence of God. The synthesis of Hod and Netzach occurs in Yesod, the interface that realizes abstract forms in matter. Finally, in Malkuth, these forms become actualized in the physical world. The process of creation, described as the Lightning Flash, follows a path through the sephiroth, illustrating the journey from the hidden God to material change. This understanding of the sephiroth provides a framework for practical magic and spiritual growth.

The text continues to explore the concept of dimensions and paradigms. It discusses how different conditions can exist along a one-dimensional axis and how shifting to a two-dimensional paradigm introduces new conditions along the width. The model evolves to include height and depth, leading to the understanding that different conditions can exist at the same point in space at different times. The addition of time as a dimension allows for the observation of different conditions at the same point in space at different times. The text then speculates about the existence of a fifth dimension, called "E" or Ennead, where different conditions can exist at the same point in space and time but in different Enneads. This new dimension implies the parallel existence of different things and events, similar to mystic experiences and the concept of parallel worlds in the Kabbalah.

The text also explores the idea of other forms of existence, such as beings that lack the last dimension (time and movement) and exist in a reduced paradigm. It discusses how these beings might grow in space continuously and irreversibly, like plants or fungi. The text then considers beings that lack both area and spreading over a surface, existing only along a line, like solid objects. The text concludes with a meditation exercise to help understand the structure and reality of other dimensional existences and their relation to our own.

The text then shifts to a discussion of the Covenant of the Goddess, a non-profit religious organization founded in 1975 to increase cooperation among Witches and secure legal protection for Witches and covens. The Covenant publishes a newsletter, issues ministerial credentials, sponsors a national festival, and encourages networking. It is a confederation of covens and solitaires of various traditions who share in the worship of the Goddess and the Old Gods and subscribe to a common code of ethics. The text outlines the structure, code of ethics, confidentiality, newsletter, finances, membership criteria, and ministerial credentials of the Covenant.

The text also includes a pledge to Pagan spirituality, emphasizing the importance of channeling spiritual energy to help and heal oneself and others, respecting the diversity of nature, using psychic power wisely, creating positivity, acting honorably, and remaining strong and committed to spiritual ideals.

Finally, the text discusses the principles of the Craft, including the importance of love, harmony with the forces of the universe, the law of cause and effect, the interconnectedness of all things, the use of astrology, the existence of the life-force, and the practice of magick. The text emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior, personal responsibility, and the continuous evolution of the human potential.

"Witchcraft For Tomorrow" pp.172-173 Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 321 sacred-texts | Web | Powered by Sponsored Links: Internet Book of Shadows, (Various Authors), [1999], at sacred-texts.com Hill Country Pagan Grove Austin, Texas, U.S.A. Published December 1982 by C.C.C. Creative Cooperative Consolidated 12611 Research Blvd. Number 125 Austin, Texas 78759 U.S.A. First edition, December 1982 Second edition, revised, April 1983

PREFACE

Some have asked how this little booklet came into being. It's all very straightforward: as the most visible representatives of paganism here in Austin, Texas, I and my consort, Arnthor Phalius, are often asked to appear in public to talk about witchcraft. The questions included here are those most often asked, along with the answers we give.

Of course, we cannot pretend to speak for all Pagans, only for ourselves. But the little booklet has been well-received as a non-threatening method of getting to know a subject like Wicca. Occasionally we will find someone who has had negative experiences with persons who call themselves Wiccans or Witches, and in those cases, they expressed relief on finding that 'other types' of Pagans existed than those which had given them their initial bad impressions.

The Directory* is an individual effort at networking in the Sunbelt. Here in Texas, there are many traditions and varieties of Paganism, and if one isn't to be alone, one must learn that there are more similarities than differences in Paganism and the other major religions. Pagans have always known this, but for various reasons, have not stepped forward as representatives of this view.

I (Merlana) am a mystic who responds to the Universal Mind as it is expressed in Nature. It is my deep belief that persons who reverence these principles are unified at bottom, and separated only by the illusion of words, which are not reality. Sometimes words aren't even adequate representations of 'Reality'!

It is my intention in this little booklet to re-define some issues and terms in the way that my tradition sees them. It so happens that much of the rest of Paganism falls within this general framework. (NOTE: A 'tradition' is a varietal type, like 'denomination').

If you already know the subject and wish to differ, your comments are welcome. If you are new to the subject, perhaps here you'll find some questions answered, and (if wanted) fellowship with others who are on similar paths. Directory* listings are free to those in the Sunbelt of the USA (South and Southwest.) New editions are published irregularly.

If you don't live in the Sunbelt, but have goods or services which interest Pagans, you may also put an ad into the Directory.* Write for details.

Blessed be, Merlana April 1983

1. WHAT IS WICCA?

'Wicca' (pronounced Wick-ah) is one name given to the Nature religions practiced in Northern Europe and the Middle East from the times of the ice ages. It is one spiritual path out of many in a group of spiritual practices known as NeoPaganism. NeoPaganism is currently in a world-wide revival, led by persons and groups in the United States and Britain.

2. HOW DO WICCA AND NEOPAGANISM FIT TOGETHER?

Wicca is one subsidiary form, or 'tradition,' similar to the way Christianity has many forms. One can be a Christian and still be Baptist, Methodist or Roman Catholic. In the same way, one can be a Pagan but ascribe to another, more specific, sub-variety of philosophy.

3. IS IT THE SAME AS WITCHCRAFT?

One linguistic theory has the word Wicca coming from Olde English 'Wicca-Craeft', meaning 'craft of the wise ones.' Most followers of Wicca (and most Pagans) prefer not to use the terms 'witchcraft' or 'witch' because of the emotional connotations these words carry in our society.

Generally, one who calls him or herself a 'witch' without further qualifications is seeking notoriety and special attention. Those of us who guard the portals of personal Power (like Carlos Casteneda's character Don Juan) are normally hard to find or engage in discussion. Our Mysteries are carefully hidden from the world, and from those who might be tempted to misuse them.

4. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE ABOUT GOD?

Although Pagans generally agree that one God exists and is the same regardless of name, they vary in specific concepts about God, as in other religions.

What an individual Pagan holds is strictly a matter of personal belief. However, occasionally a tradition will teach highly-specific concepts, structures and mythologies. If one finds oneself in disagreement, the best policy is 'voting with the feet', or withdrawing to find another group who better agrees.

NOTE: Sometimes it may be easier to gather together a group of people who believe as you do to form an entirely new group. That's the purpose of networking, or what the booklet is designed for.

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 323

Most Wiccans divide the Godhead (generally conceived of as Mother Nature) into two forces. One force is male and the other female. They are called respectively: The God and The Goddess.

Between them, these two divinities create balance and harmony in the Eternal Dance. They represent the forces of birth, death and regeneration symbolized in the change of the seasons. Wiccans call this cycle The Wheel Of The Year. Most rituals celebrate the Wheel Of The Year and our deep, meaningful participation in natural cycles of change.

Because the male force has been in ascendancy for thousands of years due to the Christian, Moslem and Jewish religions, there is presently a tendency to emphasize The Goddess, especially by feminists (or by those whose personal concept of God happens to be female).

We also believe in Magick, which is a partnership between humanity and the Universal Mind. This partnership creates changes in what we normally call 'reality', i.e., change accomplished with prayer. These changes can seem miraculous or merely coincidental, and always include personal effort. Magick is not the same as 'wishing.'

5. WHAT HAPPENS AT A WICCAN CEREMONY?

There are several types of get-togethers that Pagans of all traditions attend. The most available and open is called a 'Grove,' where those who wish may study both spiritual and ceremonial topics. Most groves emphasize fellowship and harmony of mind between their members. You should choose one as much for how you blend with the personalities of the members as for a particular brand of teaching.

Eight times a year, at the solstices and equinoxes, May Day, Halloween, and other points on the lunar calendar, Pagans gather together (usually outdoors under trees) to celebrate Nature and the turn of the seasons.

These celebrations consist of dancing, prayer, invocations, and rituals passed down from the many traditions through the ages. We also urge participants to develop and use their own original rituals and to share them with others.

Because we dance and pray in a standing Circle (or sometimes a spiral), and because we draw at these times from the Universe spherical energies of protection and power - these meetings are called (appropriately enough!) Circles.

6. HOW CAN I ATTEND A GROVE OR CIRCLE?

Wiccans and Pagans tend to be very private, and do not advertise their faith as publicly as some others might. This is mainly because of past persecutions. However, for those who are sincerely interested, there always exist persons with whom to visit and explore that interest. Check the Directory* at the back of this booklet for names of others who are open to contacts.

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 324

If you are sincere and really want to set out upon the Pagan path, the first step is to find a Grove to study with. After a Grove accepts you, eventually you will attend Circles.

7. DO I HAVE TO GIVE UP MY OTHER SPIRITUAL PATHS TO BECOME A WICCAN?

That will depend on the tradition and the teacher. In general, Pagans are most tolerant of any philosophical structure, and ask only that the tolerance be returned. You will not be requested to do anything that differs with your beliefs and spiritual needs.

8. DOES BEING PAGAN MAKE A PERSON SPECIAL OR DIFFERENT?

Well yes, of course. But the special qualities are available to everybody. Everything that Pagans do with Magick is done in other religions by other names. It is only that we have found that these particular formulas, beliefs, and celebrations work best for us.

These are varying approaches to (and grasps of) personal Power. One way of recognizing someone who is truly Powerful is to note whether he or she seems to need control or influence over others. True personal power is content to control only the self, and personal reality.

9. DO YOU CAST SPELLS ON OTHER PEOPLE?

The major law in our religion is: "Do what you will, an it hurt no other." (The Golden Rule)

In other words, no one is prevented from exploration of God and GodSelf as long as others are not harmed.

We do believe in directing the energies of the universe toward accomplishment of certain ends, but magick is never effective on another person unless the person specifically requests it and takes responsibility for that request.

Attempts at so-called 'black' magick, or use of the universal energies for negative or harmful purposes, only result in karmic backlash magnified at least threefold on the unfortunate would-be black magician.

Our tradition does not believe in the possibility of 'psychic attack', and hence does not teach methods for combating it. Our philosophy tells us that to raise a force against 'psychic attack' is only to create that which you fear.

10. ARE PAGANS ANTI-CHRISTIAN?

No. But many Christians are anti-Pagan. Historically there has existed an adversary relationship between Christianity and the Nature Religions (largely created by Christians).

It takes much universal love not to strike back when attacked, and occasionally a Pagan might seem bitter or afraid as the result of anti-Pagan treatment. This is only a personal reaction, not a characteristic of the religion itself.

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 325

It is also true that Wiccans and Pagans have suffered dismissal from jobs and worse simply from their religious affiliation being revealed. Events like these lead to a certain caution and sometimes even an attitude approaching mild paranoia.

11. WHO IS IN CHARGE OF PAGANISM?

Each person is in charge of him or herself, responsible totally to Godd/ess. One might hear an individual called High Priestess, or Priest, but this title has more to do with the role played in ceremonies than with status in any formal hierarchy.

Groves and teaching groups sometimes have various levels of initiation, but again, these are individual to each tradition.

12. WHAT MAKES WICCA DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PATHS THAT BELIEVE IN THE PSYCHIC POWERS?

We usually find that people most often comment on the robes and the tools. Traditionally we wear special garments while engaging in devotions, as a male Jew wears prayer shawl and skullcap. The garments have symbolisms, and stand for beliefs of the person wearing them.

The tools are: a cup, knife, staff (or wand), and the pentacle, a 5-pointed star with 5th point upward, enclosed in a circle.

For those familiar with the tarot cards, this was the original source of the tarot suits as well as many meanings and symbolisms in the tarot deck.

13. WHAT IS DONE WITH THE TOOLS?

They are used, along with other objects, like candles, bells, and incense to focus energies and influence Universal forces with our prayers. If the format reminds you of Roman Catholic mass, that's because much of the indigenous Nature Religion's mysteries were 'adopted' when Christianity moved into Northern Europe -- into England, Scotland, Ireland and Scandinavia ... the lands of the Celts.

Also, if the tools and concepts seem to resemble elements in Rosicrucianism, the Caballa, and the Masonic Temple, it is because the latter paths drew and adopted Pagan rituals and forms for other uses. Since ours was an oral tradition we gratefully acknowledge the role these organizations played in bringing to modern times knowledge and insights which have otherwise been lost.

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 326

Here's a bit of trivia: Although the Founding Fathers of the U.S.A. generally held indifferent attitudes about Christianity they were all thirty-third degree Masons. Obviously they sought to incorporate their high ideals into writing our first constitution. This odd fact explains to some people why fundamentalist Christians and the constitution occasionally seem to be at cross-purposes.

14. HOW LARGE IS THE RELIGION?

Since Wicca, or Paganism, is an alternative religion uninterested in power or clout, we measure our 'size' usually only by spiritual growth. There is a national newspaper published quarterly by which many Pagans keep in touch.

15. WHAT ABOUT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY?

That's magick, too! Craft practitioners of old WERE the scientists ... there was need for healers and herbalists, agriculture and astronomy experts. The scientific method has now made teaching these subjects respectable in universities. But in the process we have lost the lore's former integration of the spiritual relationship between God Expressed As Nature and ourselves.

Many of us are scientifically trained and hold technological jobs and interests. This does not interfere with but only adds to a desire for ritual celebration and union with Godd/ess. Also many of us are ourselves practicing psychics, or are interested in extrasensory perception (ESP) and its uses. Paganism makes available a philosophical structure for all of these ends utilized effectively for millennia. It urges individuals to develop their personal powers within that structure and to use them thereafter in a responsible way.

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 327

16. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE: WHY DON'T I EVER HEAR OR READ ABOUT PAGAN CHARITIES OR GOOD WORKS?

Good news makes terrible press. News media and supermarket tabloids would much rather print scandal and controversy. How many times have you seen a headline that attributed a person's conduct to his/her belief in Witchcraft? Do you ever see the same types of stories about Moslems, Jews or Christians?

In addition, organized charity can only be accomplished under certain forms of organized religious structures. That takes leadership, delegation of powers, community resources and accumulation of money and collective wealth.

We focus instead on personal responsibility and the necessity of reflecting Godd/ess in our characters and lives. Occasionally persons in the Craft will join together to change a situation or to help someone, but this is always done quietly and with the full knowledge and permission of those for whom the help of change in requested. It is always done without taking public credit. We feel that Godd/ess knows, and that is all we need.

17. HOW CAN WE SUM THIS UP IN A FEW WORDS?

WicEvent organizers and open-circle coordinators have a responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable environment. The Pagan community in the Pacific Northwest is evolving an ethical standard for organizers, which Althea Whitebirch calls choice-centered. This model is based on discussions and experiences within the community.

**Ritual Choices:**
- **Explain the Ritual:** Basic announcements should be made, such as not crossing circle boundaries indiscriminately and walking clockwise within them.
- **No Pressure to Physically Touch:** Participants should not feel pressured to touch others if they are uncomfortable. No kissing spirals in open circles.
- **Choice in Participation:** Participants should be able to step back if the dancing gets too rapid or wild. Organizers should provide clear instructions on how to do this.

**Stimulants:**
- **Alcohol:** If alcohol is used in a communal cup, everyone should be informed, and a substitute should be available.
- **Drugs:** Drugs are not allowed at events. Private drug use is discouraged to avoid legal issues and protect the community's image.

**Minors:**
- **Supervision:** Young children supervised by Pagan parents are welcome. Teenagers with absent, non-Pagan parents or guardians are a concern. A 'no minor without attending parent' policy is being considered.

**Solomonic Decisions:**
- **Exclusion:** Organizers may need to exclude individuals based on accusations of violence, theft, or sexual coercion. Options include allowing anyone to attend, individual organizer decisions, or flagging individuals based on complaints.

These guidelines aim to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all participants.Event organizers and open-circle coordinators have a responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable environment.

Organizers may need to exclude individuals based on accusations of violence, theft, or sexual coercion. Options include allowing anyone to attend, individual organizer decisions, or flagging individuals based on complaints. Failure to accept probation means immediate expulsion. This procedure has not been used because the person decided the effort wasn't worth it. Other organizers were notified.

Caretaking involves having 'greeters' or ombudsmen available for participants' support, solving problems, holding hands, and liaising with staff. This role was missed at SolCon '86, and the event coordinator couldn't check in with everyone. Visible concern and caring for everyone should become a community standard.

Organizers are the focus of energies coming into and generated by the event. A festival is magic, and the organizer shepherds the magical child through its inception, allowing participants to share in its direction. This outline is a suggestion for focusing event magic, including conception, presentation, orientation, major or parting ritual, and post-event focus.

Organizers represent the community and are accountable to participants, other organizers, and community elders. Financial transparency is important, and organizers should consider compensating staff for their work. Organizing is a heavy responsibility, and organizers have a right to ask for hugs. Discussion on these issues is encouraged to safeguard the community and ensure perfect love and perfect trust.

As always, feedback is welcome.Selecting a crystal is not much different from selecting a pet or a work of art. When you go into the store to purchase your crystal—or any other stone used in healing or psychic work—just pick the one that "calls" to you. Handle the various stones and place them, one by one, in your receptive hand (the one that is not your dominant hand; if you are right-handed or ambidextrous, your receptive hand is your left. If you are completely left-handed, your receptive hand is your right). The stone that is right for you will "pull" you to it. This may not be the stone that looks the clearest or the most impressive. Our society's materialistic values and our conditioning to accept them must not enter into our decision, which is very hard for most of us at first. Our first tendency is to judge the stone—as we always judge ourselves and everything else in a constant stream of thoughts—by what we have been conditioned to believe is "good" or "bad."

If the piece you are choosing is for a specific purpose, such as healing, enhancing your psychic abilities, or meditation, it will help if you keep that purpose in mind while you are selecting the stone. An interesting phenomenon often happens to people who are just getting into gem and mineral healing or psychic work. Most people start off with clear quartz because it has the most applications. They go into a store or a gem show to purchase clear quartz and find themselves drawn to all kinds of other "rocks" (as the collectors call them) too. Many times they bring a bag of various mineral specimens home with them. Later, they look up the stones in one of the many reference books on this subject, only to find the stones they were drawn to are exactly the ones they need to deal with issues or illnesses that they need to work on.

The very first thing you need to do when you first get a crystal is to "clear it" from the imbalanced energies of anyone else who has touched it. Crystals "work" because of their piezoelectrical field. Researchers in Kirlian photography and other subjects have long shown us that the body is surrounded by a field of electromagnetic energies, which psychics call the aura. People who have studied this subject tell us that crystals help us by attuning their piezoelectrical charge to the charge of our auras. So we must first remove the charges from the stone that come from others' handling of it. This is done by leaving the stone in sea-salt (available at almost any health-food store) for three days. The only time you will have to use this technique—which is drastic—to cleanse the stone is when you first buy it. The reason I say the technique is drastic is because it erases all of your energy from the stone too, so the stone has to be rebonded. This piezoelectrical effect of the stone is the same reason that quartz is useful in making computers, telephones, watches, and other electronic devices.Manannan, chief of the Tuatha de Danaan, was greater even than their king, Nuada. His sons were Donall Donn-Ruadh, Sgoith Gleigeil, Goitne Gorm-Shuileach, and Sine Sindearg. Manannan understood all enchantments, so the Tuatha de Danaan left it to him to find places for them where they would be safe from their enemies. He chose the most beautiful hills and valleys of Ireland and put hidden walls about them. He helped Angus to get the Brugh na Boinne away from the Dagda by trickery. Aine may have been his daughter. Some say he was killed by Uillenn Faebarderg in battle at Magh Cuilenn. He raised Deirdre's children, taught Diarmuid the use of weapons, and taught Cuchulain the use of the Gae Bulg. Some say he was Deirdre's father and a shape-changer, and was Culain, the Smith. He was the major sea god, ruling Tir Tairngiri. His wife was Fand.The High Priest blesses the High Priestess on various parts of her body, starting with the right side of each pair. He says, "Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways. Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar. Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be. Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty. Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names." They embrace, and the High Priestess spreads her arms wide. She then lays down in a pentagram position, and the High Priest covers her with a veil. He calls a woman witch to bring his athame and a male witch to bring the chalice of wine. The High Priest delivers an invocation, and the High Priestess holds up the chalice while the High Priest lowers his athame into the wine. They thank the Lady and Lord for blessings and abundance, and the chalice is passed around the Coven with a kiss. The High Priestess faces East and thanks the Lords of the Watchtowers, drawing the Banishing Pentagram of Earth. The Coven faces each direction in turn, thanking the Lords of the Watchtowers and ending the Circle. The meeting concludes with a loving party, possibly involving a May Pole and forfeits. Beltane is a time for "green wood marriages" and unbridled sexuality.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

"f time and aeons". But let’s steer clear of speculation that would not be apt for a speck of dust. Resume: when every section of this way has its own distinct characteristic (not affectable by time, because time doesn’t exist), it is inconceivable for us that in some places other conditions along the same length in the same sector may exist, just to the right or left of the way. Don’t forget - right/left have not been invented yet!

Were it able to move left or right, if only slightly, it might be able to experience different conditions on the same spot of its one-dimensional axis (on a border, a corner, a different surface). But what lies outside its one-dimensional paradigm is unknowable. The model for this paradigm is, therefore, that along the dimension there can only be one condition at one spot.

Let’s shift now to a 2-dimensional paradigm. Now the first dimension and the 2nd can be used, and the room presents itself to us like a section with an even surface. Along the first dimension there are still the same conditions as before, but to the side (left/right) there are some more.

The model is changed as follows: along dimension 1 (length) there can be different conditions, but at different levels of dimension 2 (width). This new being acts in a more familiar manner as, like maps for example, it orients itself according to a horizontal and vertical axis.

You can guess how the riddle continues. We learn to move or grow up and down. Now different conditions are possible on the same surface coordinates but at different heights and depths. In the new paradigm there is only one condition at one point in space.

Finally, we shift to our normal paradigm by adding time. We can now observe different conditions at the same point of space at different times, and can formulate the paradigm as follows: At the same point in space only one object can exist at the same time. This is a long-established model of physics, matching perfectly our mechanical world and our senses.

In this mental experiment we have learned 2 things:
1. Moving along a dimension, one can recognize differences. This is the characteristic of a dimension, not its definition.
2. After each shift to the next dimension, the model (dogma) of the preceding one is superseded. Generally, the most recent dimension is a continuum, i.e., a dimension that goes irreversible in one direction. Our own paradigm model consists of the (old) 3 space dimensions plus the (new) time as a continuum. How could a world look like that contains one dimension more, the fifth one, called "E" or Ennead for example? (I think Ennead is an expression from a science fiction novel, but the Ancient Egyptians had a similar expression for the place where all possibilities exist that don’t exist here; or where all the possibilities manifest that are kept by us from manifesting in this world here.)

You can construct the new model dogma by yourself: at one and the same point of space and time there CAN be different conditions (objects, colors, temperatures...), but at a different Ennead(!!).

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 290

BUT: at the same point of space at the same time and Ennead, there is again only one condition (object etc.) possible! This game can theoretically be continued forever, but soon gets uninteresting, because everything becomes far-fetched.

The step to the next dimension implies several interesting changes because:
- first of all it calls for the parallel existence of different things and events, side-by-side and at the same spot of the space/time-paradigm. This sounds very much like the sometimes incomprehensible reports of mystic experiences, whether from contemporary times like the Seth-books, or long ago, like Meister Eckhart, Tauler or Seuse. It is also similar to the picture of the 4 worlds of the Kabbala which exists inside one another, and it makes certain Egyptian mysteries understandable.
- it makes a huge number of connections possible that we normally would not think of. Numerous events inexplicable by rational thinking may have their roots here, because causality is only valid in the exact space/time paradigm and loses its ultimate character the moment a new dimension is brought in.
- most probably, and here all thinking and imagination stops, it replaces the time continuum with a ubiquitous time dimension (like length, width and height in our paradigm) where we can move freely forwards and backwards - but always at the same Ennead. Again, this dimension shift doesn’t free us completely, it just opens a gate and makes the next border visible.

The question about the quality or sense of this new E-dimension remains unanswered. But our familiar dimensions also have no state or sense or quality; they just exist and make us feel that they exist by limitations of our sense of movement etc. Although we live in this system, we cannot give a real definition of it (should we really?), only some more or less mathematical explanations. We just experience that along a dimension something changes. Dimensions let things happen. We feel something has changed along a dimension and we measure it by looking for regular changes. We measure time by observing the regular movements of the sun and the earth, but with no feeling for their pure quality.

Also, a new dimension E would not change our world radically; its only effect to our paradigm would be that some additional things happened - miraculously side-by-side in time. But as we have no sensors for this, it would be totally imperceptible. And should a short impression slip through, it would be instantly erased by our mind’s censor. Moreover, if some of us should get to this dimension it would prove nearly impossible to explain it to others; having no common language, comparisons or symbols for it.

This mental experiment has done its job, if we have achieved a feeling for what supradimensionality could be. Our paradigm is not the ultimate possibility, others exist - in between!

Other Forms of Existence:
Anyone used to observing nature from the heart, will have seen that it doesn’t like to have jumps in it; especially when it is only to be fitted into an artificial theoretical system of the human brain’s. Therefore, it is not consequent to assume that our paradigm of a space+time-continuum is the only valid system. The motto cannot be: "either you are with us in our system, or you are non-existent!" - a logical chain that we tend to follow all too often. If there are more simple dimensional systems, they will surely have their inhabitants. However, the creative amongst you should refrain from designing flat monsters for a 2-dimensional world now. As explained before, this all exists in our world, one in the other!

Again a little mental experiment may show us the way. Let’s imagine the following:
1. We put away all conditions related to the last dimension, the continuum. At the same time the last-but-one dimension becomes the continuum automatically, as explained before, because the last dimension always is a continuum (!!). It is interesting that our time-continuum physically is related only to movement, which means that everything able to move freely can experience time. (As stated here, the gift that our space+time paradigm gives to us is motion. Now, in Ancient Egypt, a very important symbol was the Ankh, meanings originally a sandal’s belt (scientists say). So, the meaning of the respective hieroglyph means "TO WALK". On Egyptian pictures, when a GOD gives life to a HUMAN he hands an ANKH to him, i.e. giving him LIFE = TO WALK = MOVEMENT.)

So we ignore everything that has to do with motion. And the space becomes continuum.
2. We look for forms of existing lacking exactly that last paradigm element, i.e., (in our case) time and movement.
That means we are looking for something that fulfills the picture of this reduced paradigm. In our previous example: something that doesn’t move, but spreads in space continuously and irreversibly. Just let the picture grow before thinking further; that’s it - GROWING! Anything that grows steadily and cannot shrink deliberately.

We may think of plants growing, clouds rising, micro-organism, fungi etc. For example, a tree starts from an exact point in space (the seed) and spreads evenly according to a distinct blueprint. Its size, especially the section rings of its stem, correlate exactly with its age; that means spatial growing and age match exactly. It cannot shrink definitely; it is able to drop leaves or branches, but they soon grow back to make it fill the same space occupied before. The process of spatial growth is irreversible. A harrowing thought - most probably we "grow" through time in the same manner! Maybe, even like some herbs or grass that die off in Autumn and grow again in the Spring - a picturesque allegory of death and rebirth!

For our next example we again take one dimension less. Now there is no free (active) motion and no growth in space. The continuum is the surface. A much more tricky paradigm. Something existing here must have the tendency to spread in surface as much as possible and never contract again deliberately. Hmmm.. what’s the biggest surface on earth? Of course, water! Water, as a liquid, can be formed freely, as it has no fixed form and will mold itself to fit any surface. But it cannot be compressed, and has the tendency to fill a space from beneath with the maximum of even surface at the same time. The gain with this form of existence is in the changeability of form - its flexibility and adaptability. The picture for this is the ocean, the river, or organisms like lichens which exist in clumps or patches.

Our next move is one more step towards reduction of existence. Now there is no area and no spreading over a surface. The continuum is dimension 1, the line, and everything else is fixed. In this paradigm all solid objects exist. Changes, if any, are only allowed along one line and are irreversible as in falling towards a center of gravity for example, or rolling down a slope. This dimension 1 does not have to be a straight line, but is the most efficient and best way of coming nearer to the center of attraction. Irreversible.

It’s interesting to see that we humans still align our orientation in space according to these same systems as described. The vertical line is a solid object hanging down, the plumb-rule; the horizontal surface, the level, is adjusted by hydrostatic balance (with water!). And the only independent (i.e., not geodetic) system for measuring height is an instrument derived from a barometer (the altigraph), which works on the basis of the expansion and reduction of a specific gas volume in a sealed shell.

These thoughts are certainly a little bit hard to chew on, but I’m sure they give enough themes for meditation.

Last amended June 11, 1989 -- Page NEXTRECORD 293

Here’s an example for a simple meditation; freestyle of course. Get yourself into a trance-journey somehow. You may use a shamanic technique or jump through a Tattwa sign or whatever you prefer and are best used to. Let’s take the water element for example. According to classical technique, you imagine the horizontal syrinx sign and go through it (but in silver and not in green as usual when you want to explore the water world) and become the water yourself. Try to let the feeling flow freely. Flow down, spread, split into drops while breaking on a stone that lies in the water way; flow down as a torrent etc.; trickle to the ground; evaporate to the sky; experience total passivity in the respect of controlled growth or active motion. Be totally passive! It is important to collect oneself after this meditation and perform a thorough earthing. This exercise is comparatively easy with the water element. It is also possible with the 3-dimensional system (plant or cloud), but more complicated, or with the 1-dimensional system (solid object), but the latter takes a long time in my experience.

The purpose of this exercise is to get a feeling for the structure and physical reality of other dimensional existence and their relation with other systems, and to comprehend that these need not be projected to distant universes, but really exist in our world and that we meet them every day.

For people dealing with magic it is of immense value to get the right feeling of the existence of one universe in the other, and to be able to shift from a low dimensional system to a supradimensional system and vice versa. This is because we face many phenomena reaching into our paradigm from other systems. For example, severe distortions of reality go hand-in-hand with deep trance, (lucid) dreams and precognition. These all make our reality and our normal environment appear more or less different from normal experience: for example, when we experience our home in dream reality or on a mental journey, the table in the room isn’t where it normally used to be or maybe the window is on another wall and looks into a different landscape etc. All this is due to distortions along the 5th dimension (the Ennead as I named it provisionally).

Last amended June 11, 1989Over the years, I've conducted professional seminars to teach people to be hypnotists, trainers, and counselors. Many of those who conduct trainings and rallies have come to me and said, "I'm here because I know that what I'm doing works, but I don't know why." After showing them how and why, many have gotten out of the business or have decided to approach it differently or in a much more loving and supportive manner.

Many of these trainers have become personal friends, and it scares us all to have experienced the power of one person with a microphone and a room full of people. Add a little charisma and you can count on a high percentage of conversions. The sad truth is that a high percentage of people want to give away their power—they are true "believers"!

Cult gatherings or human-potential trainings are an ideal environment to observe first-hand what is technically called the "Stockholm Syndrome." This is a situation in which those who are intimidated, controlled, or made to suffer, begin to love, admire, and even sometimes sexually desire their controllers or captors.

But let me inject a word of warning here: If you think you can attend such gatherings and not be affected, you are probably wrong. A perfect example is the case of a woman who went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship to study Haitian Voodoo. In her report, she related how the music eventually induced uncontrollable bodily movement and an altered state of consciousness. Although she understood the process and thought herself above it, when she began to feel herself become vulnerable to the music, she attempted to fight it and turned away. Anger or resistance almost always assures conversion. A few moments later she was possessed by the music and began dancing in a trance around the Voodoo meeting house. A brain phase had been induced by the music and excitement, and she awoke feeling reborn. The only hope of attending such gatherings without being affected is to be a Buddha and allow no positive or negative emotions to surface. Few people are capable of such detachment.Event organizers and open-circle coordinators have a responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable environment. The Pagan community in the Pacific Northwest is developing an ethical standard for organizers, which Althea Whitebirch calls choice-centered. Here is a model for discussion:

**Ritual Choices:**
- **Explain the Ritual:** Basic announcements should be made, such as not crossing circle boundaries indiscriminately and walking clockwise within them.
- **No Pressure to Physically Touch:** Holding hands is generally acceptable, but kissing spirals in open circles are discouraged to respect personal boundaries.
- **Choice in Participation:** Participants should be able to step back if the dancing gets too rapid or wild. Clear understanding of the ritual's intensity is essential.

**Stimulants:**
- **Alcohol:** If alcohol is used in a communal cup, everyone should be informed, and a substitute should be available.
- **Drugs:** Drugs are not allowed at events. Private drug use is discouraged to avoid legal issues and protect the community's image.

**Minors:**
- **Supervision:** Young children supervised by Pagan parents are welcome. Teenagers with non-Pagan parents or guardians pose challenges, and a 'no minor without attending parent' policy is considered.

**Solomonic Decisions:**
- **Handling Complaints:** Organizers face tough decisions about excluding individuals based on accusations of violence or sexual coercion. Options include:
  1. Allowing anyone to attend any event.
  2. Each organizer individually choosing who to deny attendance to.
  3. Flagging individuals accused of theft, assault, or sexual coercion and notifying all event organizers.
  4. Offering probation with a sponsor acting as a liaison between the individual and the community.

These guidelines aim to ensure a respectful and safe environment for all participants.Nowadays, all blood is sent to a lab to be tested for the presence of AIDS antibodies. If you test positive, they'll notify you by mail. You'll be asked if you've eaten in the last four hours, and if not, sent to the canteen for cookies and juice.

Then comes the fun part—you go lie down on a table where a phlebotomist (who draws the blood) asks you some questions, verifies your name, and then sets you up to donate. They tie a rubber hose around your arm so the vein will stand out and be easy to find. They use cold liquid ethyl chloride on your arm to numb it where the needle goes in. It does hurt when the needle is inserted, but it's tolerable. When it's in place, you'll hardly know it's there. At this time, they'll leave you there for up to five minutes while you clench and relax your hand to keep the blood from clotting, and the blood flows into a little plastic bag. It's warm and red, and rather reassuring. At this time, you can get into some serious prayer or hum a little healing chant for the person your blood's going to. I once got a flash image of a little boy, a burn victim. I always wondered who got my blood that day. I wouldn't recommend getting too spaced-out though; remember you've got to be able to return to yourself when you want to, and the physical effects of giving blood can make some people light-headed or slightly woozy. When they ask you how you're feeling, be honest, not macho. You don't want to embarrass yourself by fainting.

Afterwards, they'll ask you to have some juice and cookies. By all means, do! For one thing, you've earned them; for another, it's important to replace the fluid and blood sugar you just gave up. Working magic really takes it out of you, too (at least it does me).

In my experience, there are several good reasons to use this particular method of blood sacrifice: a) It doesn't require the death of one of the Gods' children. b) It is giving of yourself—for the good of others as well as your own. c) It is safe—the Blood Bank uses sterile instruments and never re-uses needles, so you can't catch anything. d) You have the added benefit of being able to see the blood as it's being given (somehow that adds to my experience), and a pint is a lot more than I've ever been able to get with a knife! Next time you want to get the Gods' attention, try it!Event organizers and open-circle coordinators have a responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable environment.

These guidelines aim to ensure a respectful and safe environment for all participants.

Some organizers have had good experiences with 'greeters' or ombudsmen. This is a staff position responsible for participant support, solving problems, and being a liaison with staff. At SolCon '86, the absence of greeters was regretted as the event coordinator couldn't personally check in with everyone.

Organizers in the Pacific Northwest show visible concern and care for everyone. A friend once said, "I love these events because I always feel so cherished." This sentiment is hoped to become a community standard.

An organizer is the focus of the energies coming into and generated by the event. A festival isn't just about magic; it is magic. The organizer shepherds the magical child through its inception, allowing participants to share in its direction.

This outline is a suggestion for focusing event magic, covering major points like conception, presentation, orientation, major or parting ritual, and post-event focus.

Organizers represent the community and are accountable to participants and other event organizers. Financial transparency is also important, as seen when SolCon '86 attendees received a financial accounting.

Organizing is a heavy responsibility and a lot of work. Organizers have a right to ask for hugs and seek consensus on ground rules to safeguard the community. Feedback is always welcome.

**Statement of Principles and Ethics--Lifeway Shamanic Fellowship**

By Usen's grace, Ho-dah....

1. **Purposes:**
   - This is an era of decision. Do we allow ourselves to harm the Mother who has nourished us, or do we work to walk in Beauty and Harmony with Her, cherish Her, and work to see Her healed? The resurgence of Shamanism, the primal Earth Religion of practically all of the Earth's pre-Agrarian cultures, is an important thing, foretold by the Paiute prophet Wovoka and in the Hopi Prophecies. It was said that both the Red Man would return to the Ways of the Old Ones and that the non-Native would also embrace the Lifeway. There are non-Natives who respectfully have chosen these Ways and are carrying them on in a reverent way. If the Lifeway was only given for the Native peoples, it would die out within our lifetime. There are simply not enough traditional Elders left. It has been shown to some of us that Our Mother The Earth is not willing to die quietly. She has demonstrated this by the increase in natural disasters of the past decade, which continue day by day. The Hopi prophecies state that, when the "bowl full of ashes" (most interpret this as the Thermonuclear Bomb) is overturned, that Our Mother shall rise up in Her righteous anger and destroy humanity. This prophecy is coming true, although it may yet be reversible. Perhaps it is we who reverence the Ways and walk in harmony with Our Mother that may stay Her hand. The Lifeway Fellowship is here for those who wish to honor Our Mother and Our Father, Earth and Sky, and to honor The Giver Of Life, from whence all things flow in the Universe. Our world-view is primarily allied with that of the Navajo/Dineh, Apache/Teneh, and Hopi peoples. However, we do not represent ourselves as the keepers of those ways. The secrets of those Nations are for them alone, unless Usen' wishes to reveal them to us. Our mission is to help heal Our Mother, The Earth, and to help each other walk in closer harmony with Her. We also exist to provide a way for urban and sub-urban people to learn and practice the root Shamanic techniques that aid us in finding our True Vision and True Way of Power, and following that Vision and that Way. We identify ourselves as Pagan and as unashamed Pantheists and Polytheists. The Lifeway is truly a religious commitment. No one can make a commitment to the Lifeway and to the worship of Life Giver, The Earth Mother, and The Sky Father and remain a worshiper of other Paradigms of the Deity, much as one cannot be a Christian and worship the Greco-Roman pantheon. However, this does not imply the condemnation of other Paradigms, nor impel a duty to "convert" others. We stand by other Pagans who do not share our paradigms, IE. Wiccans, Asatruans, Hellenists, and other Shamanic traditions, (African and neo-African (Santeria & Voudoun), Australian, Siberian, Traditional Native American, and Polynesian, to name a few) and even though we may disagree with some or all of their practices and beliefs, they are Brothers, Sisters, and Cousins, and in times of persecution as well as times of goodwill we must defend them. We may even share in their open rituals and allow them to share in our open ceremonials. But that which is ours must remain ours, just as that which is theirs must remain theirs.

2. **The(a)ology:**
   - As our Fellowship is inherently religious, we must declare a The(a)ology. This is summed up very easily. There are three main powers we worship, Usen' the Life Giver, The Earth Mother, and The Sky Father. The latter Two are emanations of the First, as all, including the God and the Goddess, are emanations from Usen', which is the primeval First Cause. Usen': One cannot look upon The Life Giver as either Male or Female, for The Life Giver is beyond those distinctions. Usen', and The Life Giver, are names for this First Cause, this Force that pervades all and caused all to come into being. From Usen', the God, Sky Father, and the Goddess, Earth Mother, emanate, as the lesser Deities emanate from Them. The Earth Mother: We live and walk and are sustained from The Earth Mother, which is our Earth. She is alive, and we all exist within Her as part of Her structure. Science, through the Gala Hypothesis, has finally acknowledged Her existence, and some even have learned the lesson that our duty in this life is to care for and honor Her. This is a lesson that all must learn, for as long as we despoil Her, we risk Her wrath. She is expressed through the faces of White Painted Woman, Who is The Woman Warrior, through Corn Mother, Who is The Nourishing Mother, and through Spider Woman, Who is The Wise Woman, The Ancient One, The Custodian of Wisdom. Women are acknowledged as being human representatives of The Earth Mother. The Sky Father: Just as among we Humans, there is both Man and Woman, so there is no Earth Mother without Sky Father. Sky Father is the air we breathe, the flame that gives us warmth and cooks our food, and brings forth the rain that fertilizes Our Mother and allows Her to provide us with the crops and animals that sustain us. Sky Father is also expressed as The Hunter, The Warrior, and First Shaman, and is also expressed in Killer Of Enemies and The Child Of Water. He is also present and acknowledged as being present in every Man. There are other spirits that exist in the Universe, some beneficent, some maleficent. But most important is Usen', Earth Mother, and Sky Father. By walking in harmony with the God(esse)s, one can tell the Good from the Evil, welcoming in Good, and protecting each other from Evil.

3. **Ethics:**
   - We have our code of Ethics. It is neither lengthy nor overly restrictive. We do not include ancient taboos in this list, such as Mother-In-Law avoidance or the taboo against Fish, because they may not apply nowadays. If you wish to not eat fish or to avoid your Mother-In-Law for religious reasons, it is your prerogative. But it is not a requirement. 1.) If the action does not harm yourself, other people or intelligent beings, or Our Mother The Earth, you are free to do as you wish. 2.) To charge for healings, sweats, or ceremonials is totally wrong and extremely offensive. Also, to charge excessively for teaching is equally offensive, but a modest fee over expenses is allowable. Your conscience is the best guide, that and the Will of the Deities. 3.) Magick should be limited only to the protection of Self and Loved Ones, and to healing and helping those in need, provided that permission is given by the patient and that help other than healing does not interfere with the Will of others. Magick that is used in a coercive (IE. Love spells) or destructive (harming or killing magick) way is patently wrong and is considered Black Magick. 4.) Contact of spirits by any means other than Shamanic journeying or the Vision Quest is very risky, and Possession is a real possibility. The practice of mediumship, or "channeling" has no place in the Lifeway, and exposes not only Self but others to danger. 5.) Permission must always be asked of the spirits of plants and/or animals before taking them for either sustenance or for medicine. 6.) One's visions and one's personal ceremonies are one's own. Personal visions should not be spoken of, but shared visions are for all of the group. 7.) It is wrong to criticize another within the group or outside the group. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, or general disrespect of others has no place in the Fellowship. Individual decisions about lifestyle and other ethical issues not covered here are an individual's own affair.

4. **Group Structure and Initiation Practices:**
   - There is only one Initiation, which is the Initiation that makes one Kin within the group and in the sight of The Deities. It is given after one has taken their first Vision Quest, has found their Power Animal(s), and has met the Shaman Within. It can only be denied to those who have met these requirements, is younger than the legal Age Of Consent (in most places, 18 years), is not of sound mind, and/or is under suspicion of being a Law Enforcement Officer or other person antipathetic to Pagan and/or Shamanic belief who requests initiation for fraudulent purposes (usually to infiltrate to either sabotage or publicly discredit the Fellowship). Initiation must not be denied on account of physical disabilities, blindness, deafness, or sterility, nor on account of sex, race, nationality, political belief, or sexual preference. There are no set offices within the Fellowship. Ideally, leadership should be by consensus, with true leaders being temporary and purpose-oriented. Facilitation of rituals may be done by any Initiate of the Fellowship. ANYONE WHO REPRESENTS THEMSELVES AS A HIGH PRIEST/ESS OF THE LIFEWAY SHAMANIC FELLOWSHIP IS A FRAUD, AND IS DOING SO CONTRARY TO THIS STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES AND ETHICS. Support of the Fellowship is done on a purely voluntary and mutual basis. No tithe or dues should be assessed unless they have been agreed upon by all members, initiates, and non-initiates alike. Membership is extended to all. But initiation is reserved for those who meet the criteria mentioned above. Non-initiates can participate in open ceremonials and in basic workshops, but may be denied participation in certain ceremonials and advanced workshops.

5. **The Question of Recognizing Shamans:**
   - In traditional societies, the title Shaman was not just an honorific, or recognition of talents. Nor was it the highest initiatory level in a Shamanic society. The Shaman was, in most cases, above the Chief in decision-making power and was judge, doctor, father-confessor, and intercessor with the Deities for the tribe. Some Shamanic societies are now providing their membership with "Shaman training seminars" and "Shaman apprenticeships" that can be had for an exorbitant price. This implies that the cost of being a Shaman can be paid in money and in a set amount of time. This is not the case. Many tribes believe that the office of Shaman is not one that is earned, but one that one is born into. Certainly, the skills are never something one is born with, and this is not merely hereditary. Rather, when a child is born, the current Shaman would recognize that the child had the POTENTIAL of being the next one, and the child's training would begin when they were considered ready by the Shaman. At adulthood, they would be tested. If they passed the test, they would become the next Shaman. If they failed, usually the test was such that they would either die outright, or they would go insane. Many "heroic quest" tales, and most notably the Arthurian legends have echoes of this practice within the ancient Shamanic traditions of Europe. But the point that is being made here is that we should not go back to that sort of way of doing things, because in this society it is nigh on impossible. The stand I am offering here is that recognition as a Shaman can be conferred only through shared vision, and signs from the Deities. It is not my place to say what the signs are...it will be obvious to the Fellowship. I am not Shaman myself, and will not brook anyone calling me that. This is something I place in the lap of the Deities to decide. I cannot do anything more. It is a mockery of those people that can truly be called Shamans, who are respected, powerful people of traditional tribes, to do anything less. In any event, to claim such a title is definitely not enough, and is punishable by withdrawing Fellowship from the one who claims to be Shaman falsely.

6. **Festivals and Worship Days:**
   - The festivals are reckoned as they have been for centuries by most Southwestern tribes, by both the Sun and the Moon. The seasons begin on the first full moon after a Solstice or an Equinox. The Solstices and Equinoxes themselves are times of celebration as well, and perhaps the period between the two (which usually works out to be no more than a week or so) could be considered a time of Holiday. Lesser ceremonials are held on New Moons and Full Moons between the first Full Moons of the seasons. Optionally certain Pagan festivals could be celebrated in conjunction with other groups, but they are not to be adopted as official Lifeway Fellowship ceremonial days. There are other ceremonials that are personal in nature, and can be held at any time, although synchronizing them with the Festivals and the New and Full Moons is advisable. They are Naming, where a newborn child is named in the presence of the group and their Life-beads given; Coming Of Age, where the child's physical maturity is acknowledged, and where, for a short time, they become Child of the Water (if a boy) or White Painted Woman (if a girl); Initiation, where a person becomes a full-fledged member of the group, given after a person becomes a legal adult; Joining, where a man and a woman consent to be married; Unjoining, where a man and woman who are married consent to have the bond dissolved, which is to be done only after four reconciliation attempts fail or after evidence of marital infidelity or abuse is given before the group; the Moonlodge, which is a special sweat for women in their Moon-time; and Release, where a ceremony for a dead member of the Fellowship is done to guide their soul Back Home. Other ceremonials that are dreamed or envisioned by a person or group are also encouraged.

7. **Summing Up:**
   - A few quick ones: One can be either clothed or unclothed at ceremonies, but it should be known that none of the Southwestern tribes did ceremonies in the nude. However, one should disrobe for the sweat lodge, as clothes are not only uncomfortable within the sweat lodge, but interfere with the cleansing process of the lodge. This Statement can be accepted or rejected by individual groups that federate themselves with Lifeway Fellowship. But federation can be denied to those groups who stray too far from some of the basic guidelines, or do anything that would sully the reputation of the Fellowship in general. Hi-dicho...this is finished. May these proceeds please Life Giver Usen', and the Mother and the Father. ENJU! Chihacou White-Puma, 1988.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

To select a crystal is not much different from selecting a pet or a work of art. When you go into the store to purchase your crystal or any other stone used in healing or psychic work, just pick the one that "calls" to you. Handle the various stones and place them, one by one, in your receptive hand (the one that is not your dominant hand; if you are right-handed or ambidextrous, your receptive hand is your left. If you are completely left-handed, your receptive hand is your right). The stone that is right for you will "pull" you to it. This may not be the stone that looks the clearest or the most impressive. Our society's materialistic values and our conditioning to accept them must not enter into our decision, which is very hard for most of us at first. Our first tendency is to judge the stone, as we always judge ourselves and everything else, by what we have been conditioned to believe is "good" or "bad."

If the piece you are choosing is for a specific purpose, such as healing, enhancing your psychic abilities, or meditation, it will help if you keep that purpose in mind while you are selecting the stone. An interesting phenomenon often happens to people who are just going into gem and mineral healing or psychic work. Most people start off with clear quartz because it has the most applications. They go into a store or a gem show to purchase clear quartz and find themselves drawn to all kinds of other "rocks" (as the collectors call them) too. Many times they bring a bag of various mineral specimens home with them. Later they look up the stones in one of the many reference books on this subject, only to find the stones they were drawn to are exactly the ones they need to deal with issues or illnesses that they need to work on.

The very first thing you need to do when you first get a crystal is to "clear it" from the imbalanced energies of anyone else who has touched it. Crystals "work" because of their piezoelectrical field. Researchers in Kirlian photography and other subjects have long shown us that the body is surrounded by a field of electromagnetic energies, which psychics call the aura. People who have studied this subject tell us that crystals help us by attuning their piezoelectrical charge to the charge of our auras. So we must first remove the charges from the stone that come from others' handling of it. This is done by leaving the stone in sea-salt (available at almost any health-food store) for three days. The only time you will have to use this technique, which is drastic, to cleanse the stone is when you first buy it. The reason I say the technique is drastic is because it erases all of your energy from the stone too, so the stone has to be rebonded. This piezoelectrical effect of the stone is the same reason that quartz is useful in making computers, telephones, watches, and other electronic devices.Manannan, chief of the Tuatha de Danaan, was greater even than their king, Nuada. His sons were Donall Donn-Ruadh, Sgoith Gleigeil, Goitne Gorm-Shuileach, and Sine Sindearg. Manannan understood all enchantments, so the Tuatha de Danaan left it to him to find places where they would be safe from their enemies. He chose the most beautiful hills and valleys of Ireland and put hidden walls about them. He helped Angus get the Brugh na Boinne away from the Dagda by trickery. Aine may have been his daughter. Some say he was killed by Uillenn Faebarderg in battle at Magh Cuilenn. He raised Deirdre's children, taught Diarmuid the use of weapons, and taught Cuchulain the use of the Gae Bulg. Some say he was Deirdre's father and a shape-changer, and was Culain, the Smith. He was the major sea god, ruling Tir Tairngiri. His wife was Fand.The complexity of the mix. The dissolved substances in the oceans became more and more complex until one day a complex molecule attracted simpler compounds to itself, and then there were two, then four. Life was born. From its simple origins, Life grew in complexity until one day a patch of green appeared, drawing energy from the Sun and exuding oxygen. Within a short time, the atmosphere changed radically. The sky became blue, the air clear and rich in oxygen. As the Earth had shaped Life, so Life began to shape the Earth. Delicately balancing and ever re-balancing between the furnace heat of her sister Venus and the icy cold of her brother Mars, Gaia, the Living Earth, had come to be.

The first animals appeared and swam in the oceans. Then venturesome ones crawled onto the land. The forms taken by life changed. Fish appeared, and dragons walked the land. Tiny furred creatures supplanted the great dragons, whose descendants now flew through the skies, clothed in feathers. By and by, some of the furred creatures came down from the trees and began to walk about on their hind legs, and then they started picking things up. Soon they were using the things they picked up. Then they started talking to each other. After they had been talking for a while, they started thinking. Some of them even started thinking about where they had come from and where they were going. And they began to wonder how everything had come to be - and why.

Well, there it is. Now that it's written, I'm wondering what it all means. You who read this have as much right to interpret it as the author, who after all is mostly gathering the thoughts and conclusions of other men and women and putting them into a hopefully attractive package. Creation myths are supposed to tell us something about the world we live in and our relationship with that world, and perhaps about ourselves. This one seems to be telling us that the world in which we live was not made, like a clock, it grew, like an embryo in an egg. We humans are as much a part of our world as the eye of an embryo is part of the embryo. We are the part of the world that "sees." And what about the Gods? Where do they fit into all this? Well, eggs generally have a mother and a father, and newborn chicks aren't aware of either until they open their eyes. We are the eyes of our world, and one of our functions is to see the Mother and Father. 

___RobinThe High Priest faces the High Priestess and takes the chalice from the man witch. The High Priest continues the invocation:

"Altar of mysteries manifold,
The sacred Circle's secret point
Thus do I sign thee as of old,
With kisses of my lips anoint."

The High Priest kisses the High Priestess on the lips and continues:

"Open for me the secret way,
The pathway of intelligence,
Beyond the gates of night and day,
Beyond the bounds of time and sense.
Behold the mystery aright
The five true points of fellowship...."

The High Priestess holds up the chalice, and the High Priest lowers the point of his athame into the wine. Both use both of their hands for this. The High Priest continues:

"Here where Lance and Grail unite,
And feet, and knees, and breast, and lip."

The High Priest hands his athame to the woman witch and then places both his hands around those of the High Priestess as she holds the chalice. He kisses her, and she sips the wine; she kisses him, and he sips the wine. Both of them keep their hands around the chalice while they do this.

The High Priest then takes the chalice from the High Priestess, and they both rise to their feet.

The High Priest hands the chalice to a woman witch with a kiss, and she sips. She gives it to a man with a kiss. The chalice is passed around the Coven, man to woman, with a kiss each time, until the entire Coven has sipped the wine. The chalice can be refilled and anyone can drink from it without repeating the ritual once the chalice has gone around once.

To consecrate the cakes, the woman picks up her athame, and the man, kneeling before her, holds up the dish. The woman draws the Invoking Pentacle of Earth in the air above the plate while the man says:

"O Queen most secret, bless this food into our bodies;
Bestowing health, wealth, strength, joy, and peace,
And that fulfillment of love that is perfect happiness."

The woman lays down her athame and passes the cakes to the man with a kiss, he passes them back with a kiss, and they are passed around the Coven the same way the wine was. Be sure to save some of the wine and some cake for an offering to the Earth and the Little Folk. After the meeting, leave the offering outside of the house if working indoors, or behind in the woods or field, when you leave if you are working outdoors.The High Priest blesses the High Priestess on both feet, both knees, womb, both breasts, and the lips, starting with the right of each pair. He says, "Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways. Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar. Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be. Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty. Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names." For the kiss on the lips, they embrace, length to length, with their feet touching each other's. When he reaches the womb, she spreads her arms wide, and the same after the kiss on the lips. The High Priestess then lays herself down, face upwards, with her arms and legs outstretched to form the Pentagram. The High Priest fetches the veil and spreads it over the High Priestess's body, covering her from breasts to knees. He then kneels facing her, with his knees between her feet. The High Priest calls a woman witch by name, to bring his athame from the altar. The woman does so and stands with the athame in her hands, about a yard to the West of the High Priestess's hips and facing her. The High Priest calls a male witch by name, to bring the chalice of wine from the altar. He does so and stands with the chalice in his hands, about a yard to the East of the High Priestess's hips and facing her. The High Priest delivers the invocation: "Assist me to erect the ancient altar, at which in days past all worshipped; The altar of all things. For in old time, Woman was the altar. Thus was the altar made and placed, And the sacred place was the point within the center of the Circle. As we have of old been taught that the point within the center is the origin of all things, Therefore should we adore it; Therefore whom we adore we also invoke. O Circle of Stars, Whereof our father is but the younger brother, Marvel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, Before whom time is ashamed, the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, Not unto thee may we attain unless thine image be love. Therefore by seed and stem, root and bud, And leaf and flower and fruit do we invoke thee, O Queen of Space, O Jewel of Light, Continuous on of the heavens; Let it be ever thus That men speak not of thee as One, but as None; And let them not speak of thee at all, since thou art continuous. For thou art the point within the Circle, which we adore; The point of life, without which we would not be. And in this way truly are erected the holy twin pillars; In beauty and strength were they erected To the wonder and glory of all men." The High Priest removes the veil from the High Priestess's body, and hands it to the woman witch, from whom he takes his athame. The High Priestess rises and kneels facing the High Priest, and takes the chalice from the man witch. The High Priest continues the invocation: "Altar of mysteries manifold, The sacred Circle's secret point Thus do I sign thee as of old, With kisses of my lips anoint." The High Priest kisses the High Priestess on the lips, and continues: "Open for me the secret way, The pathway of intelligence, Beyond the gates of night and day, Beyond the bounds of time and sense. Behold the mystery aright The five true points of fellowship...." The High Priestess holds up the chalice, and the High Priest lowers the point of his athame into the wine. Both use both of their hands for this. The High Priest continues: "All life is your own, All fruits of the Earth Are fruits of your womb, Your union, your dance. Lady and Lord, We thank you for blessings and abundance. Join with us, Feast with us, Enjoy with us! Blessed Be." Then, draw the Invoking Pentacle of Earth in the air above the plate with the athame. "Here where Lance and Grail unite, And feet, and knees, and breast, and lip." The High Priest hands his athame to the woman witch and then places both his hands round those of the High Priestess as she holds the chalice. He kisses her, and she sips the wine; she kisses him, and he sips the wine. Both of them keep their hands round the chalice while they do this. The High Priest then takes the chalice from the High Priestess, and they both rise to their feet. The High Priest hands the chalice to a woman witch with a kiss, and she sips. She gives it to a man with a kiss. The chalice is passed around the Coven, man to woman, with a kiss each time, until the entire Coven has sipped the wine. The chalice can be refilled and anyone can drink from it without repeating the ritual once the chalice has gone around once. The woman lays down her athame and passes the cakes to the man with a kiss, he passes them back with a kiss and they are passed around the Coven the same way the wine was. Be sure to save some of the wine and some cake for an offering to the Earth and the Little Folk. After the meeting, leave the offering outside of the house if working indoors, or behind in the woods or field, when you leave if you are working outdoors. The High Priestess faces East, with her athame in her hand. The High Priest stands to her right with the rest of the Coven behind them. If any tools have been consecrated, they should be held by the person furthest to the back. The Maiden stands near to the front to blow out each candle in turn. The Priestess says, "Ye Lords of the Watchtowers of the East, ye Lords of Air; we do thank you for attending our rites; and ere ye depart to your pleasant and lovely realms, we bid you hail and farewell....Hail and farewell." As she speaks, she draws the Banishing Pentagram of Earth in the air in front of her thus, each time: 2 7 4 5 6 1 3 The rest of the Coven copy the Pentagram and chorus in on the second hail and farewell. The Maiden blows out the candle and the Coven faces the south and the High Priestess says: "Ye Lords of the Watchtowers of the South, ye Lords of Fire; we do thank you for attending our rites; and ere ye depart to your pleasant and lovely realms, we bid you hail and farewell....Hail and farewell." She turns to the West and says: "Ye Lords of the Watchtowers of the West, ye Lords of Water; ye Lords of Death and Initiation; we do thank you for attending our rites; and ere ye depart to your pleasant and lovely realms, we bid you hail and farewell ....Hail and farewell." She turns to the North and says: "Ye Lords of the Watchtowers of the North, ye Lords of Earth; Boreas, thou gentle guardian of the Northern Portals; thou powerful God, Thou gentle Goddess; we do thank you for attending our rites; and ere ye depart for your pleasant and lovely realms, we bid you hail and farewell ....Hail and farewell." This ends the Circle. The party following this should be a loving one. If there is a May Pole available, circle the May Pole. Beltane is also a time for forfeits. The High Priestess picks out the people and their forfeit, except the High Priest picks out the last one to play on the High Priestess. Beltane is also a time for "green wood marriages" and other unbridled sexuality and such.Over the years, I've conducted professional seminars to teach people to be hypnotists, trainers, and counselors. Many of those who conduct trainings and rallies have come to me and said, "I'm here because I know that what I'm doing works, but I don't know why." After showing them how and why, many have gotten out of the business or have decided to approach it differently or in a much more loving and supportive manner.

Many of these trainers have become personal friends, and it scares us all to have experienced the power of one person with a microphone and a room full of people. Add a little charisma and you can count on a high percentage of conversions. The sad truth is that a high percentage of people want to give away their power—they are true "believers."

Cult gatherings or human-potential trainings are an ideal environment to observe first-hand what is technically called the "Stockholm Syndrome." This is a situation in which those who are intimidated, controlled, or made to suffer, begin to love, admire, and even sometimes sexually desire their controllers or captors.

But let me inject a word of warning here: If you think you can attend such gatherings and not be affected, you are probably wrong. A perfect example is the case of a woman who went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship to study Haitian Voodoo. In her report, she related how the music eventually induced uncontrollable bodily movement and an altered state of consciousness. Although she understood the process and thought herself above it, when she began to feel herself become vulnerable to the music, she attempted to fight it and turned away. Anger or resistance almost always assures conversion. A few moments later she was possessed by the music and began dancing in a trance around the Voodoo meeting house. A brain phase had been induced by the music and excitement, and she awoke feeling reborn. The only hope of attending such gatherings without being affected is to be a Buddha and allow no positive or negative emotions to surface. Few people are capable of such detachment.The number three was of mystic significance in many parts of the East. The Dravidians of India sacrificed three victims to the Sun-god. In western and eastern Asia, the number three had its votaries in respect of trinitarian concepts as well as the primary notions of 'the heavens, the earth, and the underworld.' Traditionally, the Syrian rite called for a royal victim. The substitution of a criminal for the king or king's son was repugnant, however, to the higher doctrine that the victim be unblemished. To solve this problem, one of the malefactors was distinguished from the other criminals by a ritual of mock-crowning and robing in the spirit of 'sympathetic magic.' By parading him as king, and calling the others what indeed they were, it was possible to attain the semblance of a truly august sacrifice. 

There is nothing in this mythos that did not originate in other cultures. We can only conclude that the death ritual of the Christian creed was framed in a pagan environment and embodies some of the most widespread ideas of Pagan religion. The two aspects in which the historic Christ is typically presented to his worshipers, those of his infancy and death, are typically Pagan. 

What about the man Jesus then? Was he divine? Did he exist? Is/was he the Savior? Most, if not all, of the Christian Belief System is Pagan in origin. It is indeed hard to force oneself to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God when such titles were readily copied from Pagan doctrine. Perhaps the only item not borrowed from Pagan sources was the Messiah concept. That, of course, was taken from the Jewish hysteria of the time. In the siege of Jerusalem in 72 C.E., there were some 18 Messiahs inside Jerusalem alone. Neither the God-man Jesus nor the self-proclaimed militant messiahs saved Jerusalem. Such was the measure of hysterical superstition upon the nation of Israel. 

There is not a conception associated with Christ that is not common to some or all of the Savior cults of antiquity. The title Savior was given in Judaism to Yahweh; among the Greeks to Zeus, Helios, Artemis, Dionysus, Heracles, the Dioscuri, Cybele, and Aesculapius. It is the essential conception of Osiris. So, too, Osiris taketh away sin, is the judge of the dead and of the last judgment. Dionysus, the Lord of the Underworld and primarily a god of feasting ('the Son of Man cometh eating and drinking'), comes to be conceived as the Soul of the World and the inspirer of chastity and self-purification. From the Mysteries of Dionysus and Isis comes the proclamation of the easy 'yoke'. Christ not only works the Dionysiac miracle but calls himself the 'true vine.'

Like Christ, and like Adonis and Attis, Osiris and Dionysus also suffer and die and rise again. To become one with them is the mystical passion of their worshippers. They are all alike in that their mysteries give immortality. From Mithraism, Christ takes the symbolic keys of heaven and hell and assumes the function of the virgin-born Saoshyant, the destroyer of the Evil One. Like Mithra, Merodach, and the Egyptian Khonsu, he is the Mediator; like Khonsu, Horus, and Merodach, he is one of a trinity; like Horus, he is grouped with a Divine Mother; like Khonsu, he is joined to the Logos; and like Merodach, he is associated with the Holy Spirit, one of whose symbols is fire.

In fundamentals, therefore, Christism is but paganism reshaped. It is only the economic and doctrinal evolution of the system—the first determined by Jewish practice and Roman environment, the second by Greek thought—that constitutes new phenomena in religious history. No religion develops in a vacuum. All religions are influenced not only by their predecessors but by the contemporaries of the time also. Such is the nature of Christism yesterday and today.

Now about Jesus the man, did he exist? I think not. All the teachings of Jesus can be attributed to other sources and grafted over the Gospel myth. Nothing he said was substantially different in any way from previous sayings. Jesus was not a man but a contrived myth. The Christian myth grew by absorbing details from pagan cults. The birth story is similar to many nativity myths in the pagan world. The Christ had to have a Virgin for a mother. Like the image of the child-god in the cult of Dionysus, he was pictured in swaddling clothes in a basket manger. He was born in a stable like Horus—the stable temple of the Virgin Goddess, Isis, Queen of Heaven. Again, like Dionysus, he turned water into wine; like Aesculapius, he raised men from the dead and gave sight to the blind; and like Attis and Adonis, he is mourned and rejoiced over by women. His resurrection took place, like that of Mithra, from a rock tomb.

The man Jesus did not exist. There are, however, sources that speak of others seeing him. These were secondhand sources. No direct observations were made. At one time or another, we have all had a vision of Deity in our minds. Such is the sight of Jesus, a mental image. What of the Gospels then? They are passion plays designed to be read or acted out in front of an audience. Passion plays were a common feature of pagan religion. Looking at the Gospels themselves, one finds a choppily written, scene-by-scene display of the life of the God-man. Only the important aspects of his life are described. The minor events and influences of the life of Jesus are not recorded, which leaves one to think that the Gospels are indeed a play.

When we turn from the reputed teaching of Jesus to the story of his career, the presumption that it has a factual basis is so slender as to be negligible. The Church found it so difficult to settle the date of its alleged founder's birth that the Christian era was made to begin some years before the year which chronologists later inferred on the strength of other documents. The nativity was placed at the winter solstice, thus coinciding with the birthday of the Sun-god. And the date for the crucifixion was made to vary from year to year to conform to the astronomical principle which fixed the Jewish Passover. In between the birth and death of Jesus, there is an almost total absence of information except about the brief period of his ministry. Of his life between the ages of twelve and thirty, we know nothing. There are not even any myths. It is impossible to establish with any accuracy the duration of the ministry from the Gospels. According to the tradition, it lasted one year, which suggests that it was either based on the formula 'the acceptable year of the Lord' or on the myth of the Sun-god.Nowadays, all blood is sent to a lab to be tested for the presence of AIDS antibodies. If you test positive, they'll notify you by mail. You'll be asked if you've eaten in the last four hours, and if not, sent to the canteen for cookies and juice.

Then comes the fun part—you go lie down on a table where a phlebotomist (who draws the blood) asks you some questions, verifies your name, and then sets you up to donate. They tie a rubber hose around your arm so the vein will stand out and be easy to find. They use cold liquid ethyl chloride on your arm to numb it where the needle goes in. It does hurt when the needle is inserted, but it's tolerable. When it's in place, you'll hardly know it's there. At this time, they'll leave you there for up to five minutes while you clench and relax your hand (to keep the blood from clotting) and the blood flows into a little plastic bag. It's warm and red, and rather reassuring. At this time, you can get into some serious prayer or hum a little healing chant for the person your blood's going to. I once got a flash image of a little boy, a burn victim. I always wondered who got my blood that day. I wouldn't recommend getting too spaced-out though; remember you've got to be able to return to yourself when you want to, and the physical effects of giving blood can make some people light-headed or slightly woozy. When they ask you how you're feeling, be honest, not macho. You don't want to embarrass yourself by fainting.

Afterwards, they'll ask you to have some juice and cookies. By all means, do! For one thing, you've earned them; for another, it's important to replace the fluid and blood sugar you just gave up. Working magic really takes it out of you, too (at least it does me).

In my experience, there are several good reasons to use this particular method of blood sacrifice: a) It doesn't require the death of one of the Gods' children. b) It is giving of yourself—for the good of others as well as your own. c) It is safe—the Blood Bank uses sterile instruments and never re-uses needles, so you can't catch anything. d) You have the added benefit of being able to see the blood as it's being given (somehow that adds to my experience), and a pint is a lot more than I've ever been able to get with a knife! Next time you want to get the Gods' attention, try it!The Wiccan Rede states, "If it harm none, do as ye will." This principle is more complex than it sounds and differs from simply saying, "Do whatever you want as long as nobody is hurt." Understanding your True Will can be challenging, and determining what is harmful, rather than just painful or unpleasant, is not much easier.

Initiation into Wicca involves contacting and forming a good relationship with the Gods and Goddesses of Wicca. This process is preceded by at least a year and a day of preparation and study and must be performed by a qualified Wiccan Priestess and Priest. The central event of Initiation is between the individual and their Gods, but the Priestess is necessary to make the Initiation a Wiccan one, to pass some of her power onto the new Priestess or Priest, and to connect them to the Tradition they are joining.

Women hold a central place in Wicca. A Traditional Coven is always headed by a High Priestess, a Third Degree female Witch with at least three years and three days of specific training. A Priest is optional, but the Priestess is essential. Similarly, a Priest may not Initiate without a Priestess, but a Priestess alone is sufficient. Women are primary in Wicca for many reasons, one of which is that the Goddess is central to the religion.

People often ask if they can become Wiccan and still remain a Christian, Muslim, practicing Jew, etc. The answer is no. The "one god" religions reject other paths besides their own, including each other's. "One-god" religions also do not exalt the Female as Wicca does, and mixing two such different traditions would dilute them both. However, being Jewish is an exception since it is a race and culture as well as a religion. There are many Wiccan Jews, but they practice Wicca, not Judaism.

People interested in Wicca are usually curious about the magick that Wiccans can do. While magick (spelled with a "k" to distinguish from stage conjuring) is not a religion in itself, it is related to Wiccan religious beliefs. Wiccans believe that people have many more abilities than are generally realized and that it is a good idea to develop them. Wiccan magick is a way of using natural forces to change consciousness and material conditions as an expression of one's True Will. Part of becoming a Wiccan involves training in methods of psychic and magickal development.

Because Wiccans believe that everything a person does returns to them magnified, they will not work magick for harm, as they would pay too high a price. However, helpful magick is beneficial for both the giver and receiver. Wicca is entirely compatible with the scientific method, and Wiccans believe all the Gods and forces they work with to be natural, not supernatural. They do not, however, support scientific dogma or pseudoreligion that sees everything as dead matter and neglects its own method by promoting "facts" without honest examination of evidence.

Long ago, the spiritual ancestors of Wiccans were Priestesses and Priests to the Pagan culture as well as devotees of their Mystery. Now that a Pagan culture is rising again, some ask if today's Wiccans could resume that role. This seems unlikely. Today's Pagan culture is very diverse and more interested in exploring and creating new forms than in building on existing traditions. A public role would either dilute Wiccan traditions or force them on an unwilling audience. The neo-Pagan community generally prefers "media figures" and rapid membership and growth, which is not compatible with Wicca's slow methods of training and Initiation, the insistence that livelihood come from work outside the Craft, or the need for privacy. Wicca is not accepted in the American workplace or political system and may never be. The most powerful Priestesses are often unknown to all but their Coveners. While all Wiccans are Pagans, not all Pagans are Wiccan, and it is best that it remains so.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

The dissolved substances in the oceans became more complex until one day, a complex molecule attracted simpler compounds to itself, and then there were two, then four. Life was born. From its simple origins, life grew in complexity until one day, a patch of green appeared, drawing energy from the Sun and exuding oxygen. The atmosphere changed radically. The sky became blue, the air clear and rich in oxygen. As the Earth had shaped life, so life began to shape the Earth. Delicately balancing and ever re-balancing between the furnace heat of her sister Venus and the icy cold of her brother Mars, Gaia, the Living Earth, had come to be.

The first animals appeared and swam in the oceans. Then venturesome ones crawled onto the land. The forms taken by life changed. Fish appeared, and dragons walked the land. Tiny furred creatures supplanted the great dragons, whose descendants now flew through the skies, clothed in feathers. By and by, some of the furred creatures came down from the trees and began to walk about on their hind legs, and then they started picking things up. Soon they were using the things they picked up. Then they started talking to each other. After they had been talking for a while, they started thinking. Some of them even started thinking about where they had come from and where they were going. And they began to wonder how everything had come to be - and why.

Well, there it is. Now that it's written, I'm wondering what it all means. You who read this have as much right to interpret it as the author, who after all is mostly gathering the thoughts and conclusions of other men and women and putting them into a hopefully attractive package. Creation myths are supposed to tell us something about the world we live in and our relationship with that world, and perhaps about ourselves. This one seems to be telling us that the world in which we live was not made like a clock; it grew like an embryo in an egg. We humans are as much a part of our world as the eye of an embryo is part of the embryo. We are the part of the world that "sees." And what about the Gods? Where do they fit into all this? Well, eggs generally have a mother and a father, and newborn chicks aren't aware of either until they open their eyes. We are the eyes of our world, and one of our functions is to see the Mother and Father.The Charges are based on the rules of life indicated by the High Song of Odin and in the Lay of Sigurd in which the Valkyrie gives counsel to Sigurd. They may be summarized as demanding in the struggle for life a self-reliance which should be earned by a love of learning and industry, a prudent foresight in word and deed, moderation in the gratification of the senses and in the exercise of power, modesty and politeness in intercourse, and a desire to earn the goodwill of our fellow men.

The first four Charges seem fairly innocuous, but the Fifth Charge sounds rather sinister! Isn't it all very violent and retributive? "To suffer no evil to go unremedied," does appear to run contrary to the trends of modern progressive thinking. And the idea of fighting "against the enemies of family, nation, race, and faith" would be anathema to many people. Unlike the Christian, whose duty it is to "turn the other cheek" and to be patient and long-suffering under the most grievous attacks, it is the duty of the Odinist to punish wrongs and above all those wrongs offered to his own family and kin. Society's enemies already know the basic law of life: that the race is to the strong and that the meek will inherit the earth only when the earth inherits them dust to dust. Others should also learn to recognize this truth.

What do you mean by "kinship loyalty"? We must of course give loyal service to anyone or any concept to whom or to which loyalty is due. But we owe our loyalty in the fullest degree to our immediate family and to those who are related to us by blood-ties or blood-brotherhood. A husband owes loyalty to his wife, for instance, and vice versa, just as a son owes loyalty to his parents to a greater extent than to anyone outside the immediate family circle. Beyond that, we owe allegiance to our own country and racial kindred before we can even consider giving it to strangers who must therefore have the last call upon us. But there may be occasions when loyalty to nation and kin must transcend even our loyalty to our own family.

This concern for kin is an essential part of Odinist teaching. More than twelve centuries ago, the Christian proselytizer, Boniface, wrote of the Odinists, "Have pity on them, because even they themselves are accustomed to say, 'We are of one blood and one bone'." Filial love, patriotism, and kinship loyalty are religious principles still adhered to by Odinists. In the words of the Edda: "We shall help our kinsmen as foot helps foot. If one foot stumbles then shall the other restore balance."

You seem to have an exaggerated respect for things like law and order! What about unjust laws? No, not an "exaggerated respect for law and order"; just regard for the rules by which civilized man must live. But laws, to be just, must apply equally to all citizens and groups without discrimination. Odinists certainly have a duty to oppose what they regard as unjust laws but in doing so they accept the consequences of their opposition and do not expect to be given exemption or favorable treatment.

What view do Odinists take of modern, enlightened substitutes for traditional, repressive forms of punishment? Do you agree that the wrong-doer in our society is more often than not the victim of his environment and that we are thus all guilty? Odinists refuse to accept responsibility for the actions of others. Just as it would be wrong to accept credit for another person's merits so it is wrong to relieve the wrong-doer of responsibility for his actions. "Crime should be blazoned abroad by its retribution," wrote Tacitus. Punishment should be an unpleasant and memorable experience. Those in authority who neglect to punish the criminal adequately place themselves in the position of being accessories after the fact. Odinists believe that anyone who seriously or continually flouts the law should forfeit for a period of time his rights to protection under that law; enemies of the community should not be permitted to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds!

The Sixth Charge speaks about putting no faith in the pledged word of a stranger people. What is meant by "a stranger people"? By "a stranger people" we mean those from different cultures than our own. It is a warning that words often mean different things to different peoples, that their standards are not always the same as our own. It is simply one of those things in life that ought to be widely known and appreciated but does not seem to be!

Please explain the Ninth Charge, which speaks of "the decrees of the Norns". Who or where are the Norns? The Norns are the three Fates of Northern mythology, the Goddesses of time. They are named Urd (the past), Verdande (the present), and Skuld (the future). They watch over man; they spin his thread of fate at his birth and mark out with it the limits of his sphere of action through life; their decrees are inviolable destiny, their dispensations inevitable necessity. Urd and Verdande, the past and present, may be seen as stretching a web from the radiant dawn of life to the glowing sunset, while Skuld, the future tears it to pieces! Man's fate must be met but the way in which it is met rests with the individual; and by the way in which he meets his fate man is able to demonstrate his free will. This important principle shows a man that it is worth while fighting life's battles courageously while at the same time fate's inexorable nature allows no room for careful weighing of arguments for and against or for anxiety about the nature of things that are in any case destined to happen.

What other aspects of human behavior are admired by Odinists? The Noble Virtues are held in high esteem. They are: Courage, Truth, Honor, Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Industriousness, Self-reliance, Perseverance. The Odinist must do what lies before him without fear of either foes, friends, or the Norns. He must hold his own council, speak his mind, and seek fame without respect of persons; be free, independent, and daring in his actions; act with gentleness and generosity towards friends and kinsmen but be stern and grim to his enemies (but even towards the latter to feel bound to fulfill necessary duties); be as forgiving to some as he is unyielding and unforgiving to others. He should be neither trucebreaker nor oathbreaker and utter nothing against any person that he would not say to his face. These are the broad principles of Odinist behavior, features of the spirit that made our Northern peoples great.

You call industriousness a Noble Virtue? What is so spiritual about that? Industriousness is a virtue which, partly inherited, is nevertheless acquired largely through training and self-discipline; it is at once something we owe to ourselves, to our family, and to the community. There is a time for relaxation as there is a time for most things but it is not, for instance, during our working hours; neither should it be at the expense of other members of the community by way of the so-called welfare state.

What about material possessions? A principle of Odinism is the realization of the worthlessness and fleeting nature of worldly possessions. Enough should be enough. Adam of Bremen, a Christian, remarked how Odinists with whom he had come into contact "lack nothing of what we revere except our arrogance. They have no acquisitive love of gold, silver, splendid chargers, the furs of beaver and marten or any of the other possessions we pine for". One thing alone is worth while in this life: the stability of a well-earned reputation. "Goods perish, friends perish, a man himself perishes," says the Edda "but fame never dies to him that hath won it worthily."

You describe self-reliance as one of the Noble Virtues. Surely even you must admit that none of us is, or can be, self-reliant in these days? Self-reliance does not, as you appear to suggest, imply selfishness or mean that a man must live in isolation from his fellows. We recognize that men are dependent upon Nature and on the community of which he forms part; he has obligations to that community as well as to his employer (or employees). He receives from society and he owes a debt to society. Odinism teaches that people must be encouraged to stand on their own feet and not to ask continually, "When is somebody going to do something for me?"

Do Odinists believe in prayer? Odinism is not a philosophy invented to ease mankind's comfort or to assuage his fears; that kind of religion acts against rather than in man's interests because it takes from him his independence and self-respect and makes of him a humble supplicant by encouraging him to shed his responsibilities. The person who prays to a saint or God asking for help or guidance is seeking to shift the responsibility from his own shoulders, surrendering his own faculties of thought and physical action, unless he also does something to help himself. To pray is to beg and plead; it is self-abasement ("we worms of the earth"). That is not the object of true religion which, as Carlyle has told us, is "transcendent wonder": wonder without limit or measure, reverent admiration alike for the immensity of creation, the inspiration of the human heart, and the capability of the human brain. Odinists in their inveitan (praise); singular, inveita) call upon the Aesir to approach them in their thoughts as they themselves strive towards the Aesir. Through increased understanding is achieved wholeness, a unity with the Gods that helps us to think out our problems and how they may be overcome. We project the Gods within ourselves and that, externally realized, speaks to the divine in others. Through their invetian Odinists express gratitude for life and the world they live in and resolve to try to make it better - not just to leave it to "someone up there" or hope for something better in the next world.

How do Odinists regard good and evil? Evil of itself cannot originate in man but must always be regarded as an intruder, like an illness or an affliction; as such it must be opposed and expelled. Good and evil are relative: there can be no absolute norm and actions must depend upon circumstances and motives as well as time and place. The ethical standards relating to custom and tradition are flexible and responsive to the specific demands of different ages, so that moral judgments of what is right and wrong cannot be placed in a fixed system of standards but must vary according to time and situation. Just as the world is constantly changing so are values constantly changing, so that nothing can be regarded as unconditionally good or evil in all ages. In general, that which disturbs the social order and peaceful evolution and causes unhappiness - including such natural disasters as floods and earthquakes, disease and pollution - obstructs the natural development of the world and must be regarded as evil. As for sin, Odinism knows but two major sins - perjury and murder: that is sin against the Gods and sin against one's fellow man.

Do you believe in Original sin? Man is inherently good and the world in which he lives is good. There is no sin in man which has been inherited from his first, or any other, ancestor; it is enough that he should be held responsible for his own actions. But although his spirit is good, his flesh and his senses may succumb to evil, especially when by neglecting his own spiritual well-being he has left his defenses weakened. So it is necessary for him to be able to distinguish between what is good and what is evil.

What do Odinists believe about marriage - and divorce? Odinists support the institution of marriage and marital fidelity. But a broken marriage is an unhappy marriage and traditional Odinic law allows great latitude to separation of husband and wife, at the will of both parties, if a good reason exists for the desired change. It is recognized that the worst possible service is rendered to those who are forced to live together against their will; but it must be borne in mind that marriage is basically a solemn exchange of vows between two people and as such can only be ended by agreement between the same two people.

Does Odinism offer salvation to those who believe? Odinism offers no salvation in the sense in which that term is used by Christians. Instead, the Odinist seeks liberation by bringing the Aesir into the world of man and into his daily life - whether at home or at work. Liberation refers to the human condition as we know it, which is subject to birth and death and decay. It is not, "the kingdom of God which is within you," but the Gods themselves which exist within man.

Does man possess an immortal soul? Is there a life after death and will people go to Odin in heaven? Odinists believe that man consists of body (i.e. matter) and spirit or soul. Physical man is born, produces young, and eventually dies. But the whole of Nature shows us that death is not final: the material body decomposes and recombines, it is regenerated and lives again. As it was in the beginning so it is now; every atom continues to exist and must exist as in the beginning. There is nothing new under the sun and what we call death is really nothing more than transformation. Spiritual man is divided into two distinct souls, one passive, the other active, the divine and the human, which we call God-soul and human-soul. The first is in the fullest sense a divine being, contemplating a past eternity and a future immortality, occupying itself in contemplation rather than in action and to be regarded as a kind of guardian spirit. Although the God-soul and the material body are associated in this life, the former is not bound to man in the way that, say, a limb is (it may indeed absent itself from his body during sleep or periods of unconsciousness). Without the spirit there can be no motivation: when the physical change (i.e. death) takes place the God-soul passes to another living organism - a human being, a tree, an animal, perhaps a bird. This is the element that gives man his mystical attachment to a particular district or country (which is what we call patriotism): because it is where the God-souls of countless generations of ancestors dwell. It is because of this that man is compelled to nurture, love, and defend his country, which is, in the purest sense, a holy land. The philosopher Fichte said, "Death is the ladder by which my spiritual vision rises to a new life and a new nature." This is also the reason why Odinists regard all life as sacred and unnecessary violence as criminal. The human-soul (or self-soul), is essentially individual to a particular person. It may be likened to his personality, his fame or his infamy. Because the whole of man's life is a continuing struggle of the good and light Gods on the one hand and the offspring of chaotic matter (the giants, Nature's disturbing forces) on the other, the human-soul is extremely active. It is involved in a struggle that extends to man's innermost being: both the human-soul and the God-soul proceed from the Gods; but the body belongs to the world of giants and they struggle for supremacy. If the human-soul conquers by virtue and courage then it goes after death to Valhalla, to fight in concert with the Gods against the evil powers. If on the other hand the body conquers and links the spirit to itself by weakness then after man's death the human-soul sinks to the world of the giants and joins itself with the evil powers in their warfare against the Gods. Long after his individual identity has been forgotten a man's human-soul, absorbed into the corporate spirit of the regiment, college, village, nation or other group, continues to demonstrate its immortality by inspiring future generations to noble deeds - or to acts of degradation.

If the God-soul migrates to other living things after death, how can you square this with, for example, the need to slaughter livestock in order to sustain human life? Isn't it rather like killing a God? The God-soul must not be confused with the being that it inhabits. Animals, birds, and trees have always been regarded by Odinists with respect; it is indeed probable that the domestication of some creatures arose from their former sacred character. Every living thing is a manifestation of the divine and its spirit is immortal: every time a tree is felled or an animal slaughtered it is indeed a kind of sacrifice. But the tree or the animal is only a temporary dwelling-place for the immortal God. Everything in Nature has a purpose and it is necessary in order that life may be sustained in others for such "sacrifices" to be made. Such an attitude encourages consideration and reverence for Nature and discourages its wanton despoliation. It is the unnecessary, cruel, or unnatural killing of animals (or of human beings), the unjustifiable destruction of trees or landscape, and the defiling of natural resources, that is wrong.

You have mentioned "ancestral spirits". Does this mean that Odinists believe in ancestor-worship? The human-souls of one's own family ancestors provide us with moral strength and inspiration. Just as we received our spirit from Odin, so we received our physical being through our parents and our ancestors from time memorial. Our respect for ancestors maintains the continuity of the family, the kin, and the race. We have a duty to try to attain the ideals of our ancestors and an equal duty of cherishing our descendants so that they in their turn will come to understand and realize our own hopes and ideals. Life is a continuing process: we must try to visualize ourselves as ancestors; for ancestors and descendants are genealogically one. Edmund Burke once remarked that society was a partnership between those who were living, those who are dead, and those yet to be born; past and present and future are seen as a continuing evolvement and must be looked upon as complete being.

What kind of status do women have within the Odinist community? Odinists do not need reminding of women's rights! Our religion anciently held women in high honor: not only are Goddesses included in the Odinist pantheon, but, when the Odinist priesthood is restored, all offices will be open to women just as they were before the Christian usurpation relegated them to permanent backbenches of religious life.

What are the chief festivals of the Odinic Rite? In ancient times there were three great festivals: Yule (the Mid-Winter Festival), Summer Finding (or spring equinox), and Winter Finding (autumn equinox). To these we nowadays add the Midsummer Festival. Yule, the popular Festival of Mid-Winter (sometimes called the Festival of Light), heralds the beginning of the Odinist year. It is the birthday of the unconquered sun, which at this time begins to new vigor after its autumnal decline when, having descended into darkness, it pauses, kindles the fire of germination, and ascends renewed with the fruit of hope. The Mid-Winter Festival includes the Twelve Nights of Yule, encapsulating the twelve months of the year in miniature, and culminates in the celebration of Twelfth Night. Summer Finding, in March, is the Festival of Odin. It celebrates the renewal, or resurrection, of Nature after the darkness of winter. It was transformed by the Christians into their Easter (named after the Odinist Goddess of the Saxons, Ostara), Rogation, and Whitsun and was also recalled in folk custom by the festivities of May Day. The Midsummer Festival, the Feast of Balder, is the great celebration of the triumph of light and the sun. WinterThe Wiccan Rede

Bide ye wiccan laws you must, in perfect love and perfect trust. Live ye must and let to live, fairly take and fairly give. For the circle thrice about to keep unwelcome spirits out. To bind ye spell well every time, let the spell be spake in rhyme. Soft of eye and light of touch, speak ye little, listen much. Deosil go by the waxing moon, chanting out ye baleful tune. When ye Lady's moon is new, kiss ye hand to her times two. When ye moon rides at her peak, then ye heart's desire seek. Heed the north winds mighty gale, lock the door and trim the sail. When the wind comes from the south, love will kiss thee on the mouth. When the wind blows from the east, expect the new and set the feast. Nine woods in the cauldron go, burn them fast and burn them slow. Elder be ye Lady's tree, burn it not or cursed ye'll be. When the wheel begins to turn, soon ye Beltane fires will burn. When the wheel hath turned a Yule, light the log the Horned One rules. Heed ye flower, bush and tree, by the Lady blessed be. Where the rippling waters go, cast a stone, the truth ye'll know. When ye have and hold a need, harken not to others greed. With a fool no season spend, or be counted as his friend. Merry meet and merry part, bright the cheeks and warm the heart. Mind ye threefold law ye should, three times bad and three times good. When misfortune is enow, wear the star upon thy brow. True in love my ye ever be, lest thy love be false to thee. These eight words the wiccan rede fulfill; An harm ye none, do what ye will.The High Priest faced the High Priestess and took the chalice from the man witch. The High Priest continued the invocation, signing the altar with kisses. He kissed the High Priestess on the lips and continued the invocation, asking for the secret way and the five true points of fellowship. The High Priestess held up the chalice, and the High Priest lowered the point of his athame into the wine. They both used both hands for this. The High Priest then handed his athame to the woman witch and placed his hands around those of the High Priestess as she held the chalice. They kissed and sipped the wine, keeping their hands around the chalice. The High Priest then took the chalice from the High Priestess, and they both rose to their feet. The chalice was passed around the Coven, man to woman, with a kiss each time, until everyone had sipped the wine. The chalice could be refilled, and anyone could drink from it without repeating the ritual once it had gone around once.

To consecrate the cakes, the woman picked up her athame, and the man, kneeling before her, held up the dish. The woman drew the Invoking Pentacle of Earth in the air above the plate while the man said a blessing. The cakes were then passed around the Coven the same way the wine was. Some wine and cake were saved for an offering to the Earth and the Little Folk, to be left outside after the meeting.

The Great Rite Actual required a chalice filled with wine and a veil of at least a yard square, preferably in a Goddess color. The Coven arranged themselves around the perimeter of the circle, man and woman alternately, facing the center. The High Priestess and High Priest stood facing each other in the center, with the High Priest kneeling before the High Priestess and giving her the Five Fold Kiss. The High Priestess then laid herself down, forming a Pentagram, and the High Priest spread the veil over her body. He delivered an invocation, and the Maiden opened a gateway in the Circle for the Coven to leave. The High Priest removed the veil, and the High Priestess rose and knelt facing the High Priest. They continued the invocation, and the High Priest and High Priestess had intercourse, a private matter between them. Afterward, the Circle was reopened, and the Coven returned. The wine was consecrated, and the chalice was passed around the Coven, man to woman, with a kiss each time. The cakes were consecrated and passed around in the same manner. Some wine and cake were saved for an offering to the Earth and the Little Folk.

The document also included a World Healing Meditation by John Randolph Price, a description of how Matrika of PAN helps Pagans in Recovery, and a Home Blessing Magick ritual taught by Selena Fox. Additionally, there was a Solitaire Imbolc Ritual by Micheal Hall, a discussion on hypnosis by the Perridwyn School of Hypnosis, and various discussions on the nature of witchcraft, magick, and the occult.The text discusses the concept of Magick and its principles, emphasizing the importance of understanding one's identity and purpose. It explains how Magick can reveal the beauty and majesty of the self, which individuals often try to suppress. The training in Magick involves exploring hidden mysteries of nature, developing new senses, and communicating with beings and forces previously inaccessible to scientific research. The document also includes a section on the laws of Magick, such as the Law of Cause and Effect, the Law of Knowledge, and the Law of Self-Knowledge, among others. These laws highlight the importance of understanding and control in Magick. The text further delves into the practice of necromancy, describing the rituals and preparations required to summon spirits or communicate with the dead. It outlines the necessary attire, the formation of a magic circle, and the specific incantations used during the process. The document also touches on the celebration of May Day, its historical significance, and various customs associated with it. Finally, it explores the relationship between quantum mechanics and Magick, suggesting that consciousness and the physical world are interconnected aspects of one reality. The text proposes that understanding and resonating with this underlying structure can enhance one's ability to influence reality through Magick.The text discusses the concept of Magick and its principles, emphasizing the importance of understanding one's identity and purpose.

The text continues to explore the intersection of modern physics and the occult, particularly focusing on theories that attempt to explain phenomena like psychokinesis, extrasensory perception, and consciousness. It mentions Walker's theory, which provides a quantitative scientific explanation for these phenomena, and discusses the hypothesis of multiple universes. This hypothesis suggests that all alternative possibilities allowed by quantum mechanics actually occur in different universes, and magicians can interpret their magic as moving their awareness between these alternative universes. The text also touches on the idea that consciousness, at its ultimate level, is subtler than time and location.

The document includes references to various works and authors, such as David Bohm's "Wholeness and the Implicate Order," Eugene Merzbacher's "Quantum Mechanics," and J.S. Bell's work on hidden variables in quantum mechanics. It also mentions the use of WordPerfect and CompuServe B protocol for writing and transmitting the article, noting the challenges of transmitting Greek and mathematical symbols with the available software and hardware.

The text then shifts to a discussion on the personal effects of magic rituals, exploring how changing attire and environment can influence one's mental state and focus. It compares this to various professions and practices, such as a Christian priest donning vestments or an actor slipping into a costume. The concept of "anchors" or reminders is introduced, which can be consciously constructed or evolve unconsciously.

The Heretic's Corner section, written by Buck Jump, offers a reflective and philosophical perspective on various topics, including the interconnectedness of humanity, the prevalence of senseless violence, and the role of magic in addressing societal issues. It emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility and the challenges of changing minds and behaviors on a large scale. The text also includes seasonal reflections and blessings, encouraging readers to appreciate the beauty of the natural world and the cycles of life.

Overall, the document provides a comprehensive exploration of Magick, its principles, practices, and its relationship with modern scientific theories, while also offering philosophical insights and reflections on broader societal issues.The number three was of mystic significance in many parts of the East. The Dravidians of India sacrificed three victims to the Sun-god. In western as in eastern Asia, the number three had its votaries in respect of trinitarian concepts as well as the primary notions of 'the heavens, the earth, and the underworld.' Traditionally, the Syrian rite called for a royal victim. The substitution of a criminal for the king or king's son was repugnant, however, to the higher doctrine that the victim be unblemished. To solve this problem, one of the malefactors was distinguished from the other criminals by a ritual of mock-crowning and robing in the spirit of 'sympathetic magic.' By parading him as king, and calling the others what indeed they were, it was possible to attain the semblance of a truly august sacrifice. 

There is nothing in this mythos that did not originate in other cultures. We can only conclude that the death ritual of the Christian creed was framed in a pagan environment and embodies some of the most widespread ideas of Pagan religion. The two aspects in which the historic Christ is typically presented to his worshipers, those of his infancy and death, are typically Pagan. 

What about the man Jesus then? Was he divine? Did he exist? Is/was he the Savior? Most, if not all, of the Christian Belief System is Pagan in origin. It is indeed hard to force oneself to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God when such titles were readily copied from Pagan doctrine. Perhaps the only item not borrowed from Pagan sources was the Messiah concept. That, of course, was taken from the Jewish hysteria of the time. In the siege of Jerusalem in 72 C.E., there were some 18 Messiahs inside Jerusalem alone. Neither the God-man Jesus nor the self-proclaimed militant messiahs saved Jerusalem. Such was the measure of hysterical superstition upon the nation of Israel.

There is not a conception associated with Christ that is not common to some or all of the Savior cults of antiquity. The title Savior was given in Judaism to Yahweh; among the Greeks to Zeus, Heilos, Artemis, Dionysus, Hercales, the Dioscurui, Ceybele, and Aesculapius. It is the essential conception of Osiris. So, too, Osiris taketh away sin, is the judge of the dead and of the last judgment. Dionysus, the Lord of the Underworld and primarily a god of feasting ('the Son of Man cometh eating and drinking'), comes to be conceived as the Soul of the World and the inspirer of chastity and self-purification. From the Mysteries of Dionysus and Isis comes the proclamation of the easy 'yoke'. Christ not only works the Dionysiac miracle but calls himself the 'true vine.'

Like Christ, and like Adonis and Attis, Osiris and Dionysus also suffer and die and rise again. To become one with them is the mystical passion of their worshippers. They are all alike in that their mysteries give immortality. From Mithraism, Christ takes the symbolic keys of heaven and hell and assumes the function of the virgin-born Saoshyant, the destroyer of the Evil One. Like Mithra, Merodach, and the Egyptian Khousu, he is the Mediator; like Khousu, Horus, and Merodach, he is one of a trinity; like Horus, he is grouped with a Divine Mother; like Khousu, he is joined to the Logos; and like Merodach, he is associated with the Holy Spirit, one of whose symbols is fire.

In fundamentals, therefore, Christism is but paganism reshaped. It is only the economic and doctrinal evolution of the system—the first determined by Jewish practice and Roman environment, the second by Greek thought—that constitutes new phenomena in religious history. No religion develops in a vacuum. All religions are influenced not only by their predecessors but by the contemporaries of the time also. Such is the nature of Christism yesterday and today.

Now about Jesus the man, did he exist? I think not. All the teaching of Jesus can be attributed to other sources and grafted over the Gospel myth. Nothing he said was substantially different in any way from previous sayings. Jesus was not a man but a contrived myth. The Christian myth grew by absorbing details from pagan cults. The birth story is similar to many nativity myths in the pagan world. The Christ had to have a Virgin for a mother. Like the image of the child-god in the cult of Dionysus, he was pictured in swaddling clothes in a basket manger. He was born in a stable like Horus—the stable temple of the Virgin Goddess, Isis, Queen of Heaven. Again, like Dionysus, he turned water into wine, like Aesculapius, he raised men from the dead and gave sight to the blind; and like Attis and Adonis, he is mourned and rejoiced over by women. His resurrection took place, like that of Mithra, from a rock tomb.

The man Jesus did not exist. There are, however, sources that speak of others seeing him. These were secondhand sources. No direct observations were made. At one time or another, we have all had a vision of Deity in our minds. Such is the sight of Jesus, a mental image. What of the Gospels then? They are passion plays designed to be read or acted out in front of an audience. Passion plays were a common feature of pagan religion. Looking at the Gospels themselves, one finds a choppily written, scene-by-scene display of the life of the God-man. Only the important aspects of his life are described. The minor events and influences of the life of Jesus are not recorded, which leaves one to think that the Gospels are indeed a play.

When we turn from the reputed teaching of Jesus to the story of his career, the presumption that it has a factual basis is so slender as to be negligible. The Church found it so difficult to settle the date of its alleged founder's birth that the Christian era was made to begin some years before the year which chronologists later inferred on the strength of other documents. The nativity was placed at the winter solstice, thus coinciding with the birthday of the Sun-god. And the date for the crucifixion was made to vary from year to year to conform to the astronomical principle which fixed the Jewish Passover. In between the birth and death of Jesus, there is an almost total absence of information except about the brief period of his ministry. Of his life between the ages of twelve and thirty, we know nothing. There are not even any myths. It is impossible to establish with any accuracy the duration of the ministry from the Gospels. According to the tradition, it lasted one year, which suggests that it was either based on the formula 'the acceptable year of the Lord' or on the myth of the Sun-god.The Wiccan Rede states, "If it harm none, do as ye will." This principle is more complex than it sounds and differs from simply saying, "Do whatever you want as long as nobody is hurt." Understanding one's True Will and determining what is harmful, rather than just painful or unpleasant, can be challenging.

Initiation into Wicca involves a process of contacting and forming a relationship with the Gods and Goddesses of Wicca. This initiation follows at least a year and a day of preparation and study and must be performed by a qualified Wiccan Priestess and Priest. The central event of initiation is between the individual and their Gods, with the Priestess necessary to make the initiation a Wiccan one, passing some of her power onto the new Priestess or Priest and connecting them to the Tradition.

Women hold a central place in Wicca. A Traditional Coven is always headed by a High Priestess, a Third Degree female Witch with at least three years and three days of specific training. A Priest is optional, but the Priestess is essential. Similarly, a Priest may not initiate without a Priestess, but a Priestess alone is sufficient. Women are primary in Wicca for many reasons, one of which is that the Goddess is central to the religion.

People often ask if they can become Wiccan while remaining a Christian, Muslim, practicing Jew, etc. The answer is no. The "one god" religions reject other paths besides their own, including each other's. These religions do not exalt the Female as Wicca does, and mixing two such different traditions would dilute both. However, being Jewish is an exception since it is a race and culture as well as a religion. There are many Wiccan Jews, but they practice Wicca, not Judaism.

People interested in Wicca are usually curious about the magick that Wiccans can do. While magick (spelled with a "k" to distinguish from stage conjuring) is not a religion in itself, it is related to Wiccan religious beliefs. Wiccans believe that people have many more abilities than are generally realized and that it is a good idea to develop them. Wiccan magick uses natural forces to change consciousness and material conditions as an expression of one's True Will. Part of becoming a Wiccan involves training in methods of psychic and magickal development.

Because Wiccans believe that everything a person does returns to them magnified, they will not work magick for harm, as the price would be too high. However, helpful magick benefits both the giver and receiver. Wicca is compatible with the scientific method, and Wiccans believe all the Gods and forces they work with to be natural, not supernatural. They do not support scientific dogma that sees everything as dead matter and neglects honest examination of evidence.

Long ago, the spiritual ancestors of Wiccans were Priestesses and Priests to the Pagan culture as well as devotees of their Mystery. Now that a Pagan culture is rising again, some ask if today's Wiccans could resume that role. This seems unlikely. Today's Pagan culture is diverse and more interested in exploring and creating new forms than in building on existing traditions. A public role would either dilute Wiccan traditions or force them on an unwilling audience. The neo-Pagan community generally prefers "media figures" and rapid membership growth, which is not compatible with Wicca's slow methods of training and initiation, the insistence that livelihood come from work outside the Craft, or the need for privacy. Wicca is not accepted in the American workplace or political system and may never be. The most powerful Priestesses are often unknown to all but their Coveners. While all Wiccans are Pagans, not all Pagans are Wiccan, and it is best that it remains so.Each case must be approached individually. Changing minds en masse can be done magically; however, people who are so changed are not truly changed but only suppressed, resulting in a bunch of zombies. This sort of thing is typically done by magicians on the dark side. Adolf Hitler and Jim Jones are examples that come to mind. Both may have started with the highest motives, but when you start imposing your mind on others, things tend to come unglued. History is full of groups that acted with one mind for a while and then unraveled when the leader either died or lost influence. Even with the noblest of motives, it just won't work.

I knew this long ago but was misled about what was happening. I thought the senseless violence I saw around me was from some outside source—a mad spirit, a virus, or some sort of "disharmonic vibration." If that were the case, my idea would have been good. On the off chance that something like that is now afoot in our world, a general intention for reason and against violence can't hurt and may do some good. I'm all for anyone who tries to clean up our environment, seen or unseen. Considering the good folk who read the R.M.P.J., I'm not too worried that anyone will be misled by my last effort. At worst, those who followed my suggestion may have wasted time and effort; at best, they may have done some good by promoting reason and discouraging confusion. Cleaning the house won't stop a fire, but it will lessen the chances of spontaneous combustion and make a fire easier to fight if it does break out. My mistake was in supposing we all have more or less the same values and in externalizing the source of senseless violence.

Enough of apology and explanation. Breast-beating and patting your back are both good exercises in futility. One good bray from the donkey, one good hoot from the owl, and then back to work. We are still at risk from some angry fool armed and dangerous. What can be done? What should be done?

First, learn to perceive the violent ones. Some can see auras, some can pick up on "bad vibes," some can "smell" trouble—however you do it, use it. An antelope doesn't survive long in the veldt without looking, listening, smelling, and generally keeping on alert. Second, surround yourself with protection. Some walk in a sphere of protection, some are guided by an unseen force, and I rely on my guardian spirit or angel. Whatever protection you have, use it. Whatever ceremonies, prayers, incantations, or deep meditations you use, don't neglect them. We're back where we were when we wore fur bikinis and hunted with stone-tipped spears, but haven't we always been there? Safety, in this life, is only an illusion.

One more thing we can do and should do—we can teach. Part of the debt we owe to life is to clean the place. Not only should we pick up the trash, but we should also clean up the vicious nonsense wherever we find it. Like it or not, we are all teachers. Whatever we do, whatever we say is part of the lesson we teach.

Before all the Gods, I wish I had some magic formula to give you that would clean up the world, both seen and unseen, but I don't. The life of mankind is a hard road to travel, which is why the ultimate designed a hard bunch to travel it. My blessings on you all. May you find enlightenment. You are smart; may you find wisdom. Let this subject now be closed between us. If you have any ideas on this subject, pass them on to our long-suffering editors.

Now, it may be that I can resume my clown suit and once more arm myself with my gadfly stinger and get back to the heretic business and leave metaphysics to those better equipped to deal with it. A silversmith shoeing a horse rarely does a good job of it.

In the spring, the wild plums were blooming. White blossoms on the bough, lace for the bride. In the long summer, the little green plums grew and changed to a lighter green color. When the first frost was still up in the high country, the plums grew sweet and turned a lovely purple-pink shade. Then, at the time of the autumnal equinox, they were picked and crushed. Now the new wine works behind the air seals in the fermenter. The promise of spring blossoms is redeemed in the good strong wine of winter. What we learn in any one place we can use in another place. The wild plums are a part of life; from them, we can learn about other parts of life. When the wine falls clear, a drink all around, a toast to life. May we all go our separate ways bound for a common goal. May the flowers bloom where we have passed. Go in peace, well disposed to your fellows. With these words, I now part from thee.THE BEST OF THE REST: (Once you have a good background from the previous five books, you will find the following all make good reference books, worth having on your shelf.)

Stewart Farrar, _What Witches Do_. (Custer, WA: Phoenix Publishing, revised 1983). Paperback, $8.95
This book is so good that it almost made it into the top five, displacing _Earth Magic_. When its first edition came out in 1971, it was the only book on modern Witchcraft written for outsiders. It is surprisingly well-written and very thorough. Its only serious problem is that it is very specifically Alexandrian Witchcraft (named after Alex Sanders, its first High Priest), and some of it doesn't generalize well. Nevertheless, it has the best-written chapter on initiation, among other things, that I've seen yet.

Herman Slater (ed.), _A Book of Pagan Rituals_. (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1978). Paperback, $8.95
This is the complete Book of Shadows of a Neopagan tradition called The Pagan Way. It includes complete, very well-written rituals for all eight of the High Holidays (both solo and group ritual), plus a mixed bag of rituals for healing, trance work, and so forth. Requires some basic knowledge of the Craft and its symbolism, so it's not for beginners, but it is definitely useful to any worthwhile fully-initiated witch.

Ellen Cannon Reed, _The Witches' Qabala_. (St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1985). Paperback, $7.95
So far, only Book 1, "The Goddess and the Tree" has been published, but it's already the best book on the Qabala that I've seen yet, and the only one I would recommend to a new Neopagan Witch. The Qabala and its commentary to date contain a lot of sexist material, reflecting their Judeo-Christian origins. Ellen Reed strips all of that away, but in a way that is truer to the Qabala's origins and meaning than was the offensive material. Where she changes the traditional attributions, she documents it and includes the traditional ones as well. This book is almost a "must-read."

Jack Schwarz, _Voluntary Controls_. (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1978). Paperback, $7.95
Jack Schwarz is not a witch, but don't let that stop you from profiting from the single clearest, most practical book on kundalini-style meditation that has been published in the West. If you are having trouble meditating, or wish to do serious trance work, turn to this book first.

Camden Benares, _ZEN Without Zen Masters_. (Phoenix: Falcon Press, 1977). Paperback, $6.95
Out of print for almost 7 years, I am very happy to be able to recommend it again. This book is, among other things, proof that there is more to the Discordian branch of Neopaganism than just practical jokes. It is also the best practical book on Zen for the western world that I have seen yet. All of the best zen koans, including these, are also humorous (and therefore memorable). The book also includes many valuable exercises. As Robert Anton Wilson (see below) says in the Commentary at the beginning, "If you don't laugh at all, you've missed the point. If you only laugh, you've missed your chance for Illumination."

Robert Anton Wilson, _Cosmic Trigger: The Final Secret of the Illuminati_. (New York: Pocket Books, 1977). Paperback, $3.95
In this autobiographical work, Wilson details his initiation into and experience with almost every form of shamanic magick that is still practiced today, and draws some very surprising conclusions. Strongest point: this is a fantastic synthesis of magick, psychology, and physics. Weakest point: its central theme—that all of the great mystical societies and movements in history have been in contact with aliens from Sirius—is not taken seriously by Wilson (no matter how serious he seems in this book), and should not be taken seriously by the reader.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

Checklist for a Well-Working Group:
1. We are clear about our goals and how we intend to achieve them.
2. We know and respect each other well enough to feel very comfortable and attuned working together.
3. Our magick is ethical, designed for our growth and fulfillment and the benefit of those who request help, and it is never used to harm others.
4. We share the responsibilities of making the group work; every individual's contribution is important.
5. We see each other socially outside the group and support each other through difficulties.
6. We enjoy our meetings; there is fun and laughter.
7. We work at learning magick. We dig deep, compare different sources, try new techniques, ask pointed questions, and do it until we get it right.
8. We keep ourselves healthy and fit to more readily channel power and receive insight.
9. We keep our ritual area and tools orderly and clean.
10. We constantly seek knowledge from many sources—people, books, workshops, other paths.
11. We do not make a virtue of authority and obedience but treat each other as respected equals (regardless of the formal structure of the coven).
12. We raise genuine power and channel it; our rituals are not tame readings or rote gestures but filled with energy, vitality, will, and purpose.

A Basic Love Spell:
Take three cords or strings of various, pleasing pastel colors—perhaps pink, red, and green—and braid them tightly together. Firmly tie a knot near one end of the braid, thinking of your need for love. Next, tie another knot, and another, until you have tied seven knots. Wear or carry the cord with you until you find your love. After that, keep the cord in a safe place, or give it to one of the elements—burn and scatter the ashes in the ocean or in a stream.

The song is sung to the tune of Amazing Grace. Enjoy!
Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth
that bore a witch like me!
I once was burned, now I survive,
was hung and now I sing.
T'was grace that drew down the moon
and grace that raised the seas.
The magic in the people's will
will set our Mother free.
We face the East and breathe the winds
that move across this earth.
From gentle breeze to hurricane
our breath will bring forth the change.
Turn towards the South and feel the fire
that burns in you and me.
The spirit's flame will rise again
and burn eternally.
We greet the West, our souls awash
in tides of primal birth.
Our tears and blood, our pain and love
will cleanse and heal the earth.
Reach into the North and know your roots
down deep ancestral caves.
We find the wisdom of the Crone,
Of circles we are made.
Amazing earth, enduring life,
from death into rebirth.
T'is earth I am and earth I love
and earth I'll always be.
Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth
that bore witches like we.
We once were burned, now we survive,
were hung and now we sing.
Goddess bless, so mote it be,
Our magic spirals on.
Merry meet and merry part
and merry meet again.

The Hermetic Summoning of The Elements:
By: Marios
This was originally developed by an old friend and working partner of mine.
(Circle area should be completely dark. All people should be inside the circle. A central altar is used with five candles on it: a source candle of gray or pearlescent white or emerald green; a form candle of black; a force candle of white; a fire quarter candle of red; and a lighting taper.)
(The HP and HPS should face each other over the central altar)
HP: First there was nothing, and the Womb of the Void begat Light (light Source candle)
HPS: And that Light gave form to the Void, the form that we call darkness, and that was the first Goddess. (Light Form candle)
HP: And the darkness gave to the light potency, power, and that was the first god. (light force candle).
Both: From the union of these came Fire, least tangible and most active of all the elements. (light fire candle, hand to 3rd person in the south. they then circumambulate a full 360 degrees and place fire candle in the south, picking up air candle there.)
HPS: Fire calmed and made more tangible became air. (light Air candle, circumambulate 270 degrees to the east.)
HP: Air flowing with solid form, became water. (light water candle (in east) (circumambulate 180 degrees to the west)
HPS: And still, solid water, is earth. (3rd person goes directly to the north side of the altar)
All: Thus does all come from the Void, and so shall all return to the Void when creation's day is done.
(HP faces east, then south, then zenith. while facing shouts "Fiat". at the same times, HPS faces west, north and nadir and shouts "Fiat".
HPS raises both hands from nadir to the centre above the altar, HP lowers arms from zenith to the centre above the altar)
Both: Fiat, voluntas mea. (hands should be touching in the centre.

Notes:
1. The third person who carries the quarter candles acts as the channel for the energy of the HP and HPS during their invocation. S/he should visualize constructing a ribbon roadway that has landing stops at each elemental area.
2. The "Fiat"s at the end should include a visualization of either an invoking pentagram, or a door opening, or something similar (I have modified the invoking pentagrams to follow the descent lines -- e.g. invoking air would be from fire point to air point).
The effort of building the road and the landings is form with minimal force. It is the "Fiat"s at the end which generate the force flows to balance the system.
The road itself can be useful for visiting the various elemental kingdoms, but you might find them different from what you expect. Following the road from nadir up to and beyond zenith in an ascending arc is quite good for either deep meditation or projection work.
Anyhow, 'nuff stuff for now. I hope you find this useful.
Bright Blessings M.Encompassing the working area, this square represents the physical plane on which we exist - the Earth. Now take a long purple or white cord and lay it out in a circle, using the four stones or candles to guide you. It takes a bit of practice to smoothly do this. The cord should be placed so that the stones remain inside the circle. Now you have a square and a circle, the circle representing the spiritual reality. As such, this is a squared circle; the place of interpenetration of the physical and spiritual realms.

The size of the circle can be anything from 5 to 20 feet depending on the room and your desires. Next, set up the altar. The following tools are recommended:

* A Goddess symbol (candle, holed stone, statue)
* A God symbol (candle, horn, acorn, statue)
* Athame
* Wand
* Censer
* Pentacle
* A bowl of Water (spring, rain, or tap)
* A bowl of Sea Salt (it can also be placed on the pentacle)
* Incense
* Flowers and greens
* One red candle in holder (if not using point candles)
* Any other tools or materials required for the ritual, spell, or magickal working

Set up the altar according to the plan shown here or according to your own design. Also, be sure to have plenty of matches, as well as a small heat-proof container in which to place them when used. A charcoal block is also necessary to burn the incense.

Light the candles. Set the incense smoking. Lift the athame and touch its blade to the water, saying:

"I consecrate and cleanse this water that it may be purified and fit to dwell within the sacred Circle of Stones. In the name of the Mother Goddess and Father God, I consecrate this water."

As you do this, visualize your athame blasting away all negativity from the water.

The salt is next touched with the point of the athame while saying:

"I bless this salt that it may be fit to dwell within the sacred Circle of Stones. In the name of the Mother Goddess and Father God, I bless this salt."

Now stand facing North, at the edge of the cord-marked circle. Hold your athame point outward at waist level. Walk slowly around the circle's perimeter clockwise, your feet just inside the cord, charging it with your words and energy. Create the circle - through your visualization - with the power flowing out from your athame's blade. As you walk, stretch the energy out until it forms a complete sphere around the working area, half above the ground, half below. As you do this say:

"Here is the boundary of the Circle of Stones. Naught but love shall enter in, Naught but love shall emerge from within. Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!"

When you have arrived back at the North, place the athame on the altar. Take up the salt and sprinkle it around the circle, beginning and ending in the North, and moving clockwise. Next, carry the smoking censer from the altar, and finally sprinkle water around the circle. Do more than carrying and walking; sense the substances purifying the circle. The Circle of Stones is now sealed.

Hold aloft the wand at the North, at the edge of the circle, and say:

"O Spirit of the North Stone, Ancient One of the Earth, I call You to attend this circle. Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!"

As you say this, visualize a greenish mist rising and writhing in the Northern quarter, over the stone. This is the elemental energy of the Earth. When the Spirit is present, lower the wand, move to the East, raise it again and say:

"O Spirit of the East Stone, Ancient One of Air, I call You to attend this circle. Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!"

Visualize the yellowish mist of Air energy. Lower the wand, move to the South and repeat the following with your upraised wand, visualizing a crimson Fire mist:

"O Spirit of the South Stone, Ancient One of Fire, I call You to attend this circle. Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!"

Finally, to the West, say with the wand held aloft:

"O Spirit of the West Stone, Ancient One of Water, I call You to attend this circle. Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!"

Visualize the bluish mist, the essence of Water.

The circle breathes and lives around you. The Spirits of the Stones are present. Feel the energies. Visualize the circle glowing and growing in power. Stand still, sensing for a moment.

The Circle of Stones is complete. The Goddess and God may be called, and magick wrought.A club-shaped rock or a God-symbolic stone such as those presented below. Between these two stones, place a smaller stone with a red candle affixed to it to represent the divine energy of the Goddess and God as well as the element of Fire. Before this, place a flat stone to receive offerings of wine, honey, cakes, semi-precious stones, flowers, and fruit. A small, cupped stone (if one can be found) should be set to the left of the offering stone. Fill this with water to represent that element. To the right of the offering stone, place a flat rock. Pour salt upon this to symbolize the element of Earth. Additionally, another flat stone can be placed before the offering stone to serve as an incense burner. Use a long, thin, terminated quartz crystal as a wand and a flint or obsidian arrowhead for the Athame. Any other tools which are needed can simply be placed on the altar. Or, try to find stone alternatives to them. This can be used for all types of Craft rituals.The Charges are based on the rules of life indicated by the High Song of Odin and in the Lay of Sigurd, in which the Valkyrie gives counsel to Sigurd. They may be summarized as demanding in the struggle for life a self-reliance earned by a love of learning and industry, a prudent foresight in word and deed, moderation in the gratification of the senses and in the exercise of power, modesty and politeness in intercourse, and a desire to earn the goodwill of our fellow men.

The first four Charges seem fairly innocuous, but the Fifth Charge sounds rather sinister. "To suffer no evil to go unremedied" appears to run contrary to modern progressive thinking. The idea of fighting "against the enemies of family, nation, race, and faith" would be anathema to many people. Unlike the Christian, whose duty it is to "turn the other cheek" and to be patient and long-suffering under the most grievous attacks, it is the duty of the Odinist to punish wrongs, especially those offered to his own family and kin. Society's enemies already know the basic law of life: that the race is to the strong and that the meek will inherit the earth only when the earth inherits them—dust to dust. Others should also learn to recognize this truth.

Kinship loyalty means giving loyal service to anyone or any concept to whom or to which loyalty is due. But we owe our loyalty in the fullest degree to our immediate family and to those related to us by blood-ties or blood-brotherhood. A husband owes loyalty to his wife, and vice versa, just as a son owes loyalty to his parents to a greater extent than to anyone outside the immediate family circle. Beyond that, we owe allegiance to our own country and racial kindred before we can even consider giving it to strangers who must therefore have the last call upon us. But there may be occasions when loyalty to nation and kin must transcend even our loyalty to our own family.

This concern for kin is an essential part of Odinist teaching. More than twelve centuries ago, the Christian proselytizer Boniface wrote of the Odinists, "Have pity on them, because even they themselves are accustomed to say, 'We are of one blood and one bone.'" Filial love, patriotism, and kinship loyalty are religious principles still adhered to by Odinists. In the words of the Edda: "We shall help our kinsmen as foot helps foot. If one foot stumbles, then shall the other restore balance."

Odinists do not have an exaggerated respect for law and order; they have regard for the rules by which civilized man must live. But laws, to be just, must apply equally to all citizens and groups without discrimination. Odinists have a duty to oppose what they regard as unjust laws but accept the consequences of their opposition and do not expect to be given exemption or favorable treatment.

Odinists refuse to accept responsibility for the actions of others. Just as it would be wrong to accept credit for another person's merits, so it is wrong to relieve the wrong-doer of responsibility for his actions. "Crime should be blazoned abroad by its retribution," wrote Tacitus. Punishment should be an unpleasant and memorable experience. Those in authority who neglect to punish the criminal adequately place themselves in the position of being accessories after the fact. Odinists believe that anyone who seriously or continually flouts the law should forfeit for a period of time his rights to protection under that law; enemies of the community should not be permitted to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.

By "a stranger people," Odinists mean those from different cultures than their own. It is a warning that words often mean different things to different peoples, that their standards are not always the same as their own. It is simply one of those things in life that ought to be widely known and appreciated but does not seem to be.

The Norns are the three Fates of Northern mythology, the Goddesses of time. They are named Urd (the past), Verdande (the present), and Skuld (the future). They watch over man; they spin his thread of fate at his birth and mark out with it the limits of his sphere of action through life; their decrees are inviolable destiny, their dispensations inevitable necessity. Urd and Verdande, the past and present, may be seen as stretching a web from the radiant dawn of life to the glowing sunset, while Skuld, the future, tears it to pieces. Man's fate must be met, but the way in which it is met rests with the individual; and by the way in which he meets his fate, man is able to demonstrate his free will. This important principle shows a man that it is worthwhile fighting life's battles courageously while at the same time fate's inexorable nature allows no room for careful weighing of arguments for and against or for anxiety about the nature of things that are in any case destined to happen.

The Noble Virtues are held in high esteem. They are: Courage, Truth, Honor, Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Industriousness, Self-reliance, and Perseverance. The Odinist must do what lies before him without fear of either foes, friends, or the Norns. He must hold his own council, speak his mind, and seek fame without respect of persons; be free, independent, and daring in his actions; act with gentleness and generosity towards friends and kinsmen but be stern and grim to his enemies (but even towards the latter to feel bound to fulfill necessary duties); be as forgiving to some as he is unyielding and unforgiving to others. He should be neither trucebreaker nor oathbreaker and utter nothing against any person that he would not say to his face. These are the broad principles of Odinist behavior, features of the spirit that made our Northern peoples great.

Industriousness is a virtue which, partly inherited, is nevertheless acquired largely through training and self-discipline; it is at once something we owe to ourselves, to our family, and to the community. There is a time for relaxation as there is a time for most things, but it is not, for instance, during our working hours; neither should it be at the expense of other members of the community by way of the so-called welfare state.

A principle of Odinism is the realization of the worthlessness and fleeting nature of worldly possessions. Enough should be enough. Adam of Bremen, a Christian, remarked how Odinists with whom he had come into contact "lack nothing of what we revere except our arrogance. They have no acquisitive love of gold, silver, splendid chargers, the furs of beaver and marten, or any of the other possessions we pine for." One thing alone is worthwhile in this life: the stability of a well-earned reputation. "Goods perish, friends perish, a man himself perishes," says the Edda, "but fame never dies to him that hath won it worthily."

Self-reliance does not imply selfishness or mean that a man must live in isolation from his fellows. We recognize that men are dependent upon Nature and on the community of which he forms part; he has obligations to that community as well as to his employer (or employees). He receives from society and he owes a debt to society. Odinism teaches that people must be encouraged to stand on their own feet and not to ask continually, "When is somebody going to do something for me?"

Odinism is not a philosophy invented to ease mankind's comfort or to assuage his fears; that kind of religion acts against rather than in man's interests because it takes from him his independence and self-respect and makes of him a humble supplicant by encouraging him to shed his responsibilities. The person who prays to a saint or God asking for help or guidance is seeking to shift the responsibility from his own shoulders, surrendering his own faculties of thought and physical action, unless he also does something to help himself. To pray is to beg and plead; it is self-abasement ("we worms of the earth"). That is not the object of true religion which, as Carlyle has told us, is "transcendent wonder": wonder without limit or measure, reverent admiration alike for the immensity of creation, the inspiration of the human heart, and the capability of the human brain.

Odinists in their inveitan (praise) call upon the Aesir to approach them in their thoughts as they themselves strive towards the Aesir. Through increased understanding is achieved wholeness, a unity with the Gods that helps us to think out our problems and how they may be overcome. We project the Gods within ourselves and that, externally realized, speaks to the divine in others. Through their invetian, Odinists express gratitude for life and the world they live in and resolve to try to make it better—not just to leave it to "someone up there" or hope for something better in the next world.

Evil of itself cannot originate in man but must always be regarded as an intruder, like an illness or an affliction; as such, it must be opposed and expelled. Good and evil are relative: there can be no absolute norm, and actions must depend upon circumstances and motives as well as time and place. The ethical standards relating to custom and tradition are flexible and responsive to the specific demands of different ages, so that moral judgments of what is right and wrong cannot be placed in a fixed system of standards but must vary according to time and situation. Just as the world is constantly changing, so are values constantly changing, so that nothing can be regarded as unconditionally good or evil in all ages. In general, that which disturbs the social order and peaceful evolution and causes unhappiness—including such natural disasters as floods and earthquakes, disease, and pollution—obstructs the natural development of the world and must be regarded as evil. As for sin, Odinism knows but two major sins—perjury and murder: that is sin against the Gods and sin against one's fellow man.

Man is inherently good and the world in which he lives is good. There is no sin in man which has been inherited from his first, or any other, ancestor; it is enough that he should be held responsible for his own actions. But although his spirit is good, his flesh and his senses may succumb to evil, especially when by neglecting his own spiritual well-being he has left his defenses weakened. So it is necessary for him to be able to distinguish between what is good and what is evil.

Odinists support the institution of marriage and marital fidelity. But a broken marriage is an unhappy marriage, and traditional Odinic law allows great latitude to separation of husband and wife, at the will of both parties, if a good reason exists for the desired change. It is recognized that the worst possible service is rendered to those who are forced to live together against their will; but it must be borne in mind that marriage is basically a solemn exchange of vows between two people and as such can only be ended by agreement between the same two people.

Odinism offers no salvation in the sense in which that term is used by Christians. Instead, the Odinist seeks liberation by bringing the Aesir into the world of man and into his daily life—whether at home or at work. Liberation refers to the human condition as we know it, which is subject to birth and death and decay. It is not "the kingdom of God which is within you," but the Gods themselves which exist within man.

Odinists believe that man consists of body (i.e., matter) and spirit or soul. Physical man is born, produces young, and eventually dies. But the whole of Nature shows us that death is not final: the material body decomposes and recombines, it is regenerated and lives again. As it was in the beginning, so it is now; every atom continues to exist and must exist as in the beginning. There is nothing new under the sun, and what we call death is really nothing more than transformation.

Spiritual man is divided into two distinct souls, one passive, the other active, the divine and the human, which we call God-soul and human-soul. The first is in the fullest sense a divine being, contemplating a past eternity and a future immortality, occupying itself in contemplation rather than in action and to be regarded as a kind of guardian spirit. Although the God-soul and the material body are associated in this life, the former is not bound to man in the way that, say, a limb is (it may indeed absent itself from his body during sleep or periods of unconsciousness). Without the spirit, there can be no motivation: when the physical change (i.e., death) takes place, the God-soul passes to another living organism—a human being, a tree, an animal, perhaps a bird. This is the element that gives man his mystical attachment to a particular district or country (which is what we call patriotism): because it is where the God-souls of countless generations of ancestors dwell. It is because of this that man is compelled to nurture, love, and defend his country, which is, in the purest sense, a holy land. The philosopher Fichte said, "Death is the ladder by which my spiritual vision rises to a new life and a new nature." This is also the reason why Odinists regard all life as sacred and unnecessary violence as criminal.

The human-soul (or self-soul) is essentially individual to a particular person. It may be likened to his personality, his fame, or his infamy. Because the whole of man's life is a continuing struggle of the good and light Gods on the one hand and the offspring of chaotic matter (the giants, Nature's disturbing forces) on the other, the human-soul is extremely active. It is involved in a struggle that extends to man's innermost being: both the human-soul and the God-soul proceed from the Gods; but the body belongs to the world of giants, and they struggle for supremacy. If the human-soul conquers by virtue and courage, then it goes after death to Valhalla, to fight in concert with the Gods against the evil powers. If, on the other hand, the body conquers and links the spirit to itself by weakness, then after man's death the human-soul sinks to the world of the giants and joins itself with the evil powers in their warfare against the Gods. Long after his individual identity has been forgotten, a man's human-soul, absorbed into the corporate spirit of the regiment, college, village, nation, or other group, continues to demonstrate its immortality by inspiring future generations to noble deeds—or to acts of degradation.

The God-soul must not be confused with the being that it inhabits. Animals, birds, and trees have always been regarded by Odinists with respect; it is indeed probable that the domestication of some creatures arose from their former sacred character. Every living thing is a manifestation of the divine, and its spirit is immortal: every time a tree is felled or an animal slaughtered, it is indeed a kind of sacrifice. But the tree or the animal is only a temporary dwelling-place for the immortal God. Everything in Nature has a purpose, and it is necessary in order that life may be sustained in others for such "sacrifices" to be made. Such an attitude encourages consideration and reverence for Nature and discourages its wanton despoliation. It is the unnecessary, cruel, or unnatural killing of animals (or of human beings), the unjustifiable destruction of trees or landscape, and the defiling of natural resources, that is wrong.

The human-souls of one's own family ancestors provide us with moral strength and inspiration. Just as we received our spirit from Odin, so we received our physical being through our parents and our ancestors from time immemorial. Our respect for ancestors maintains the continuity of the family, the kin, and the race. We have a duty to try to attain the ideals of our ancestors and an equal duty of cherishing our descendants so that they in their turn will come to understand and realize our own hopes and ideals. Life is a continuing process: we must try to visualize ourselves as ancestors; for ancestors and descendants are genealogically one. Edmund Burke once remarked that society was a partnership between those who were living, those who are dead, and those yet to be born; past, present, and future are seen as a continuing evolvement and must be looked upon as a complete being.

Odinists do not need reminding of women's rights. Our religion anciently held women in high honor: not only are Goddesses included in the Odinist pantheon, but, when the Odinist priesthood is restored, all offices will be open to women just as they were before the Christian usurpation relegated them to permanent backbenches of religious life.

In ancient times there were three great festivals: Yule (the Mid-Winter Festival), Summer Finding (or spring equinox), and Winter Finding (autumn equinox). To these, we nowadays add the Midsummer Festival. Yule, the popular Festival of Mid-Winter (sometimes called the Festival of Light), heralds the beginning of the Odinist year. It is the birthday of the unconquered sun, which at this time begins to new vigor after its autumnal decline when, having descended into darkness, it pauses, kindles the fire of germination, and ascends renewed with the fruit of hope. The Mid-Winter Festival includes the Twelve Nights of Yule, encapsulating the twelve months of the year in miniature, and culminates in the celebration of Twelfth Night. Summer Finding, in March, is the Festival of Odin. It celebrates the renewal, or resurrection, of Nature after the darkness of winter. It was transformed by the Christians into their Easter (named after the Odinist Goddess of the Saxons, Ostara), Rogation, and Whitsun and was also recalled in folk custom by the festivities of May Day. The Midsummer Festival, the Feast of Balder, is the great celebration of the triumph of light and the sun. Winter Finding mourns the death of summer and heralds the coming of autumn. It is dedicated to the god Frey, patron of the harvest, and is also sometimes called the Charming of the Fruits of Earth, when we render thanks for the year's supply of life-giving foods.

Besides the great festivals, there are a number of secondary festivals and also some commemorations of local Gods or various aspects of life. The secondary festivals of the Odinic Rite are: The Charming of the Plough, January 3; The festival of Vali, February 14, which commemorates the family and is an occasion for betrothals, the renewal of marriage vows, and vows of kinship loyalty; The festival of the Einheriar on November 11, known as Heroes' day, which honors the dead.

The committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite (to give its full title) was set up on April 23, 1973, with the limited objects of restoring Odinist ritual and ceremonies, to define Odinist faith and doctrine, and to constitute a teaching order of gothar (singular: gothi, meaning priest or teacher). When these immediate objects have been achieved, the Committee will disband. In the past, not a great deal of attention was paid to systemizing the doctrinal aspects of Odinism, and consequently, the body of writing on the subject has remained limited and uneven. The Odinist Committee will place the worship of the Aesir on a more formal and permanent basis.

First of all, by understanding, then by believing. You do not have to "be born again," but you are expected to live your whole life according to the Odinist precepts. There is a ceremony of reception (or initiation) into theThe Wiccan Rede

Bide ye wiccan laws you must,
in perfect love and perfect trust
Live ye must and let to live,
fairly take and fairly give
For the circle thrice about
to keep unwelcome spirits out
To bind ye spell well every time,
let the spell be spake in rhyme
Soft of eye and light of touch,
speak ye little, listen much
Deosil go by the waxing moon,
chanting out ye baleful tune
When ye Lady's moon is new,
kiss ye hand to her times two
When ye moon rides at her peak,
then ye heart's desire seek
Heed the north winds mighty gale,
lock the door and trim the sail
When the wind comes from the south,
love will kiss thee on the mouth
When the wind blows from the east,
expect the new and set the feast.
Nine woods in the cauldron go,
burn them fast and burn them slow
Elder be ye Lady's tree,
burn it not or cursed ye'll be
When the wheel begins to turn,
soon ye Beltane fires will burn
When the wheel hath turned a Yule
light the log the Horned One rules
Heed ye flower, bush and tree,
by the Lady blessed be
Where the rippling waters go,
cast a stone, the truth ye'll know
When ye have and hold a need,
harken not to others greed
With a fool no season spend,
or be counted as his friend
Merry meet and merry part,
bright the cheeks and warm the heart.
Mind ye threefold law ye should
three times bad and three times good
When misfortune is enow,
wear the star upon thy brow
True in love my ye ever be,
lest thy love be false to thee
These eight words the wiccan rede fulfill;
An harm ye none, do what ye will.The mind is playing tricks on him. It is as if a man were told that tailors' fashion-plates were the canon of human beauty, so he tried to make himself formless and featureless like them, and shuddered with horror at the idea of Holbein making a portrait of him. Magick will show him the beauty and majesty of the self which he has tried to suppress and disguise. Having discovered his identity, he will soon perceive his purpose. Another process will show him how to make that purpose pure and powerful. He may then learn how to estimate his environment, make allies, and prevail against all powers whose error has caused them to wander across his path. In the course of this training, he will learn to explore the hidden mysteries of nature, develop new senses and faculties in himself, and communicate with and control beings and forces pertaining to orders of existence which have been hitherto inaccessible to profane research, and available only to that unscientific and empirical magick of tradition which I came to destroy in order that I might fulfill. I send this book into the world so that every man and woman may take hold of life in the proper manner. It does not matter if one's present house of flesh is the hut of a shepherd; by virtue of my magick, he shall be such a shepherd as David was. If it is the studio of a sculptor, he shall so chisel from himself the marble that masks his idea that he shall be no less a master than Rodin.

Visualize yourself as an antenna for the forces of the Multiverse. Feel the forces flowing through you from above and below. Let the energy flow through your body from the floor and the sky, passing your solar plexus and energizing it. When you feel that the energy is flowing smoothly through your body, visualize the space around you as deep blue, shimmering with energy. Inhale evenly and deeply from your diaphragm, letting your stomach expand and contract with your breath. Do not allow your upper body to be moved by the intake of breath. Let the sides and back of your midsection expand and contract with your breath. Breathe fully and calmly. Let the breath energize your cells, adding to the energy raised with the Isa meditation.

Trace the Hammer of Thor with your dominant hand using the wand or your fingers. As you trace the Thorn, say (vibrate) the word Thorn (or Thuriaz if you are using the Norse name). Visualize the energy flowing from your solar plexus, through your hand/wand, tracing the rune. Turn to the East and repeat the invocation. Then to the South, then to the West, then Above you, then below you. Turn to the North and say: "Thorn in the North, Hallow and hold this Holy Stead." Do this for the other five Thorns you have invoked.

Having invoked the six points of the circle, we will be invoking a thorny circle of briar in four parts. Each "string" will be invoked as long as you can say the word Thorn. When your breath runs out, inhale and begin another string, until you have scribed four interlacing, intricate strings of ethereal briar. You will be tracing these strings to create a ball similar to yarn. As you are tracing the strings of briar, visualize the briar as being covered with sharp, pointy, nasty-looking thorns. Invest these thorns with the power to keep out unwanted influences.

Stand facing North. Inhale and as you exhale, vibrate the word "Thorn," making the vibration of the name last as long as you have breath. As you are saying the word, trace briar in a circle around you. Visualize the stream of briar coming out of the end of your wand/finger. Trace the briar in any way you want. When your breath runs out from the first "Thorn," inhale and invoke that name again, drawing a string of briar around the inner surface of a globe, forming a globe of briar with your actions. Remember to see what is already there and fill in the spaces you have yet to get to. When you are out of breath again, inhale, and begin the third string of Briar. Don't forget to get the space over your head and below your feet. Make wide sweeping motions, small scribbly motions. Let your enjoyment of movement arouse more energy, feel the energy flowing through you, through your hand, and coming out in the stream of briar. When you are out of breath, inhale, and invoke the Thorn one last time. Make sure to get all of those places that have not been covered. Fix the holes with this last invocation.

As you finish this last invocation of Thorn, stand facing North. It is not uncommon to feel both exhilarated and exhausted by this process. Stand with feet apart and hands spread over your head. Breathe deeply. Visualize the glowing ball of briar, its green tendrils intertwining, feel the vibrance of its life force, a force that you have given to it. Breathe deeply, calming yourself. While standing with your feet apart, arms upraised in a "Y," inhale, and as you exhale feel your energy flowing through the orb of briar, and see, as you energize the orb, the thorns grow. See the thorns, brownish and reddish, getting larger and closing up the small spaces that existed between the strings of briar. Feel the spaces being blocked off. See the blue of the space around you, see the orb of thorny briars. Keep the thorns growing until you feel that the orb is complete and capable of keeping out any unwanted influences. Infuse the orb of briar with the ability to repel unwanted energies and permit those energies desired.

Stand in a comfortable position. We are near the end of the ritual. The invocation of the God/desses. Stand in the Isa position. Say IIIIIISsssssssss. Stand in the As (Anuz) position. Say Odhinn. Stand in the Beorch position. Say Urdh. Stand in the Ing position. Say Freyr. Stand in the Foeh position. Say Freya. Stand in the Thorn position. Say Thorr. Stand in the Isa position. Breathe deeply. Thank the God/desses silently. Feel the Orb of Thorns surrounding you. Begin your working, secure in your circle.I have not seen any other quantitative scientific theories that explain the results of experiments on psychokinesis, extrasensory perception, and consciousness as accurately as Walker's theory, or that give as satisfying of an explanation of the synchronicities that I, as a worker of magic and a scientist, have observed from personal experience. This is not to say that these ideas represent ultimate truth, that alternative theories do not exist, or that flaws will not be found and that alternative theories will not replace them. I would welcome hearing from others who have additional information and insight into the applicability and limitations of the theories of modern Physics as applied to the occult.

One interesting hypothesis is that of multiple universes. As I understand it, this hypothesis states that all of the alternative possibilities allowed by quantum mechanics actually occur, but in different universes. Magicians can interpret their magic as moving their awareness between these alternative universes. I have never seen the multiple universe theory set up mathematically in a way that would allow it to be quantitatively tested, using physical measurements (like was done with Mr. Walker's theory). It would be interesting to determine if and to what extent the multiple universe hypothesis can be integrated with Mr. Walker's theory. Consciousness, acting at a gross level, seems to be relativistic - something experienced by observers relative to their frames of reference. Consciousness, at its ultimate level, seems to be subtler than time and location.

When two observers see the same thing, they both may have certain experiences in common, they both may affect the thing observed, and they may report some of the events the same and some differently. Experience may be categorized in a multiple universe mode and/or in a single universe mode. It would be interesting to know which mode is most useful for various purposes. It is obvious that some people have such a different personal perception of reality as to be seemingly out of touch with the world we experience around them. Their self-world image becomes more important than anything, and they adjust their memories and perceptions to meet whatever emotional needs they have at the time. Delusions of personal reality and the high probability that such realities are real for the person experiencing that reality can result in interesting questions about what is real and what is unreal.

Although the universe may be a seamless whole, most physicists describe it in two different modes, depending on whether things are being observed or not:
- A classical, mechanistic mode for the definite attributes of observation, and
- A statistical, mathematical, quantum mechanical mode for the wave patterns described by quantum mechanics.

David Bohm has begun to develop new terminology that integrates both the process of observation and quantum theory.Each case must be approached individually. To change minds in mass can be done magically; however, people who are so changed are not really changed, but only suppressed—what you get are a bunch of zombies. This sort of thing is only done by magicians on the dark side. Adolph Hitler and Jim Jones are two examples that come readily to mind. For all I know, both of the named examples may well have started with the highest motives. When you start superimposing your mind on the mind of another or others, things have a way of coming unglued. History is full of examples of groups that acted with one mind for a while and then unraveled when the guru leader either died or ran out of gas. Even with the noblest of motives, it just won't work.

I knew all this from long ago, but I was misled as to what was going on. I thought the senseless violence I saw around me was from some outside source. A mad spirit, a virus, or some sort of "dis-harmonic vibration." If that were the case, my idea would have been a good one. On the off chance that something like that is now afoot in our world, a general intention for reason and against violence can't hurt and may well do some constructive good. I'm all for anyone who tries to clean up our environment, seen or unseen. Considering the sort of good folk who read the R.M.P.J., I'm not too worried that anyone who read my last little effort will be misled by it. I fear that at worst, those of you who followed my suggestion may have wasted both time and effort—I hope that at best, you may have done some good by promoting reason and discouraging confusion. Cleaning the house won't stop a fire, but it will lessen the chances of spontaneous combustion and make a fire easier to fight if it does break out. My mistake was in supposing we all have more or less the same values and in externalizing the source of senseless violence.

Enough of apology and explanation. Breast-beating and patting your back are both good exercises in futility. One good bray from the donkey, one good hoot from the owl, and then back to work. We are still at risk from some angry fool armed and dangerous. What can be done? What should be done?

I can think of several things to do. First, learn to perceive the violent ones. Some of us can see auras, some can pick up on "bad vibes," some can "smell" trouble—however, whichever, my advice would be to use it. An antelope doesn't long survive in the veldt without looking, listening, smelling, and generally keeping on the alert. Second, surround yourself with protection. Some walk in a sphere of protection, some are guided by some unseen force, I rely on my guardian spirit, guardian angel, or however you call her. In any case, whatever protection you have, use it. Whatever ceremonies, prayers, incantations, or deep meditations you use, don't neglect them. That is about it. We're back where we were when we wore fur bikinis and hunted with stone-tipped spears, but haven't we always been there? Safety is, in this life, I fear only an illusion.The best of the rest: Once you have a good background from the previous five books, you will find the following all make good reference books, worth having on your shelf.

Stewart Farrar, "What Witches Do" (Custer, WA: Phoenix Publishing, revised 1983). Paperback, $8.95. This book is so good that it almost made it into the top five, displacing "Earth Magic." When its first edition came out in 1971, it was the only book on modern Witchcraft written for outsiders. It is surprisingly well-written and very thorough. Its only serious problem is that it is very specifically Alexandrian Witchcraft (named after Alex Sanders, its first High Priest), and some of it doesn't generalize well. Nevertheless, it has the best-written chapter on initiation, among other things, that I've seen yet.

Herman Slater (ed.), "A Book of Pagan Rituals" (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1978). Paperback, $8.95. This is the complete Book of Shadows of a Neopagan tradition called The Pagan Way. It includes complete, very well-written rituals for all eight of the High Holidays (both solo and group ritual), plus a mixed bag of rituals for healing, trance work, and so forth. Requires some basic knowledge of the Craft and its symbolism, so it's not for beginners, but it is definitely useful to any worthwhile fully-initiated witch.

Ellen Cannon Reed, "The Witches' Qabala" (St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1985). Paperback, $7.95. So far, only Book 1, "The Goddess and the Tree" has been published, but it's already the best book on the Qabala that I've seen yet, and the only one I would recommend to a new Neopagan Witch. The Qabala and its commentary to date contain a lot of sexist material, reflecting their Judeo-Christian origins. Ellen Reed strips all of that away, but in a way that is truer to the Qabala's origins and meaning than was the offensive material. Where she changes the traditional attributions, she documents it and includes the traditional ones as well. This book is almost a "must-read."

Jack Schwarz, "Voluntary Controls" (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1978). Paperback, $7.95. Jack Schwarz is not a witch, but don't let that stop you from profiting from the single clearest, most practical book on kundalini-style meditation that has been published in the West. If you are having trouble meditating, or wish to do serious trance work, turn to this book first.

Camden Benares, "ZEN Without Zen Masters" (Phoenix: Falcon Press, 1977). Paperback, $6.95. Out of print for almost 7 years, I am very happy to be able to recommend it again. This book is, among other things, proof that there is more to the Discordian branch of Neopaganism than just practical jokes. It is also the best practical book on Zen for the western world that I have seen yet. All of the best zen koans, including these, are also humorous (and therefore memorable). The book also includes many valuable exercises. As Robert Anton Wilson says in the Commentary at the beginning, "If you don't laugh at all, you've missed the point. If you only laugh, you've missed your chance for Illumination."

Robert Anton Wilson, "Cosmic Trigger: The Final Secret of the Illuminati" (New York: Pocket Books, 1977). Paperback, $3.95. In this autobiographical work, Wilson details his initiation into and experience with almost every form of shamanic magick that is still practiced today and draws some very surprising conclusions. Strongest point: this is a fantastic synthesis of magick, psychology, and physics. Weakest point: its central theme—that all of the great mystical societies and movements in history have been in contact with aliens from Sirius—is not taken seriously by Wilson (no matter how serious he seems in this book), and should not be taken seriously by the reader.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

Previous Content: The best of the rest: Once you have a good background from the previous five books, you will find the following all make good reference books, worth having on your shelf.

Stewart Farrar, "What Witches Do" (Custer, WA: Phoenix Publishing, revised 1983). Paperback, $8.95. This book is so good that it almost made it into the top five, displacing "Earth Magic." When its first edition came out in 1971, it was the only book on modern Witchcraft written for outsiders. It is surprisingly well-written and very thorough. Its only serious problem is that it is very specifically Alexandrian Witchcraft (named after Alex Sanders, its first High Priest), and some of it doesn't generalize well. Nevertheless, it has the best-written chapter on initiation, among other things, that I've seen yet.

Herman Slater (ed.), "A Book of Pagan Rituals" (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1978). Paperback, $8.95. This is the complete Book of Shadows of a Neopagan tradition called The Pagan Way. It includes complete, very well-written rituals for all eight of the High Holidays (both solo and group ritual), plus a mixed bag of rituals for healing, trance work, and so forth. Requires some basic knowledge of the Craft and its symbolism, so it's not for beginners, but it is definitely useful to any worthwhile fully-initiated witch.

Ellen Cannon Reed, "The Witches' Qabala" (St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1985). Paperback, $7.95. So far, only Book 1, "The Goddess and the Tree" has been published, but it's already the best book on the Qabala that I've seen yet, and the only one I would recommend to a new Neopagan Witch. The Qabala and its commentary to date contain a lot of sexist material, reflecting their Judeo-Christian origins. Ellen Reed strips all of that away, but in a way that is truer to the Qabala's origins and meaning than was the offensive material. Where she changes the traditional attributions, she documents it and includes the traditional ones as well. This book is almost a "must-read."

Jack Schwarz, "Voluntary Controls" (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1978). Paperback, $7.95. Jack Schwarz is not a witch, but don't let that stop you from profiting from the single clearest, most practical book on kundalini-style meditation that has been published in the West. If you are having trouble meditating, or wish to do serious trance work, turn to this book first.

Camden Benares, "ZEN Without Zen Masters" (Phoenix: Falcon Press, 1977). Paperback, $6.95. Out of print for almost 7 years, I am very happy to be able to recommend it again. This book is, among other things, proof that there is more to the Discordian branch of Neopaganism than just practical jokes. It is also the best practical book on Zen for the western world that I have seen yet. All of the best zen koans, including these, are also humorous (and therefore memorable). The book also includes many valuable exercises. As Robert Anton Wilson says in the Commentary at the beginning, "If you don't laugh at all, you've missed the point. If you only laugh, you've missed your chance for Illumination."

Robert Anton Wilson, "Cosmic Trigger: The Final Secret of the Illuminati" (New York: Pocket Books, 1977). Paperback, $3.95. In this autobiographical work, Wilson details his initiation into and experience with almost every form of shamanic magick that is still practiced today and draws some very surprising conclusions. Strongest point: this is a fantastic synthesis of magick, psychology, and physics. Weakest point: its central theme—that all of the great mystical societies and movements in history have been in contact with aliens from Sirius—is not taken seriously by Wilson (no matter how serious he seems in this book), and should not be taken seriously by the reader.

"Lucid Dreaming" by Stephen LaBerge, Ballantine Books, New York, 1985. This 305-page book costs $3.95 and is available in the "Psychiatry" or "Self-Help" section of most major bookstores.

Checklist for a Well-Working Group:
1. We are clear about our goals and how we intend to achieve them.
2. We know and respect each other well enough to feel very comfortable and attuned working together.
3. Our magickal work is ethical, designed for our growth and fulfillment and the benefit of those who request help, and it is never used to harm others.
4. We share the responsibilities of making the group work; every individual's contribution is important.
5. We see each other socially outside the group and support each other through difficulties.
6. We enjoy our meetings; there is fun and laughter.
7. We work at learning magick. We dig deep, compare different sources, try new techniques, ask pointed questions, and do it until we get it right.
8. We keep ourselves healthy and fit to more readily channel power and receive insight.
9. We keep our ritual area and tools orderly and clean.
10. We constantly seek knowledge from many sources—people, books, workshops, other paths.
11. We do not make a virtue of authority and obedience but treat each other as respected equals (regardless of the formal structure of the coven).
12. We raise genuine power and channel it; our rituals are not tame readings or rote gestures but filled with energy, vitality, will, and purpose.

A basic love spell:
Take three cords or strings of various, pleasing pastel colors—perhaps pink, red, and green—and braid them tightly together. Firmly tie a knot near one end of the braid, thinking of your need for love. Next, tie another knot, and another, until you have tied seven knots. Wear or carry the cord with you until you find your love. After that, keep the cord in a safe place, or give it to one of the elements—burn and scatter the ashes in the ocean or in a stream.

The song is sung to the tune of Amazing Grace. Enjoy!
Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth
that bore a witch like me!
I once was burned, now I survive,
was hung and now I sing.
T'was grace that drew down the moon
and grace that raised the seas.
The magic in the people's will
will set our Mother free.
We face the East and breathe the winds
that move across this earth.
From gentle breeze to hurricane
our breath will bring forth the change.
Turn towards the South and feel the fire
that burns in you and me.
The spirit's flame will rise again
and burn eternally.
We greet the West, our souls awash
in tides of primal birth.
Our tears and blood, our pain and love
will cleanse and heal the earth.
Reach into the North and know your roots
down deep ancestral caves.
We find the wisdom of the Crone,
Of circles we are made.
Amazing earth, enduring life,
from death into rebirth.
T'is earth I am and earth I love
and earth I'll always be.
Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth
that bore witches like we.
We once were burned, now we survive,
were hung and now we sing.
Goddess bless, so mote it be,
Our magic spirals on.
Merry meet and merry part
and merry meet again.

The Hermetic Summoning of The Elements
By: Marios
This was originally developed by an old friend and working partner of mine. The circle area should be completely dark. All people should be inside the circle. A central altar is used with five candles on it: a source candle of gray or pearlescent white or emerald green; a form candle of black; a force candle of white; a fire quarter candle of red; and a lighting taper. The HP and HPS should face each other over the central altar.

HP: First there was nothing, and the Womb of the Void begat Light (light Source candle)
HPS: And that Light gave form to the Void, the form that we call darkness, and that was the first Goddess. (Light Form candle)
HP: And the darkness gave to the light potency, power, and that was the first god. (light force candle).
Both: From the union of these came Fire, least tangible and most active of all the elements. (light fire candle, hand to 3rd person in the south. they then circumambulate a full 360 degrees and place fire candle in the south, picking up air candle there.)
HPS: Fire calmed and made more tangible became air. (light Air candle, circumambulate 270 degrees to the east.)
HP: Air flowing with solid form, became water. (light water candle (in east) (circumambulate 180 degrees to the west)
HPS: And still, solid water, is earth. (3rd person goes directly to the north side of the altar)
All: Thus does all come from the Void, and so shall all return to the Void when creation's day is done.
HP faces east, then south, then zenith. while facing shouts "Fiat". at the same times, HPS faces west, north and nadir and shouts "Fiat". HPS raises both hands from nadir to the centre above the altar, HP lowers arms from zenith to the centre above the altar.
Both: Fiat, voluntas mea. (hands should be touching in the centre.

Notes:
1. The third person who carries the quarter candles acts as the channel for the energy of the HP and HPS during their invocation. S/he should visualize constructing a ribbon roadway that has landing stops at each elemental area.
2. The "Fiat"s at the end should include a visualization of either an invoking pentagram, or a door opening, or something similar (I have modified the invoking pentagrams to follow the descent lines—e.g. invoking air would be from fire point to air point).
3. The effort of building the road and the landings is form with minimal force. It is the "Fiat"s at the end which generate the force flows to balance the system.
4. The road itself can be useful for visiting the various elemental kingdoms, but you might find them different from what you expect. Following the road from nadir up to and beyond zenith in an ascending arc is quite good for either deep meditation or projection work.

Bright Blessings M.Between these two stones, place a smaller stone with a red candle affixed to it to represent the divine energy of the Goddess and God as well as the element of Fire. Before this, place a flat stone to receive offerings of wine, honey, cakes, semi-precious stones, flowers, and fruit. A small, cupped stone (if one can be found) should be set to the left of the offering stone. Fill this with water to represent that element. To the right of the offering stone, place a flat rock. Pour salt upon this to symbolize the element of Earth. Additionally, another flat stone can be placed before the offering stone to serve as an incense burner. Use a long, thin, terminated quartz crystal as a wand and a flint or obsidian arrowhead for the Athame. Any other tools which are needed can simply be placed on the altar. Or, try to find stone alternatives to them. This can be used for all types of Craft rituals.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

Stand Facing North. Assume the Isa stance, hands at side and feet together. Visualize yourself as an antenna for the forces of the Multiverse. Feel the forces flowing through you from above and below. Let the energy flow through your body from the floor and the sky, passing your solar plexus and energizing it. When you feel that the energy is flowing smoothly through your body, visualize the space around you as deep blue, shimmering with energy. Inhale evenly and deeply from your diaphragm, letting your stomach expand and contract with your breath. Do not allow your upper body to be moved by the intake of breath. Let the sides and back of your midsection expand and contract with your breath. Breathe fully and calmly. Let the breath energize your cells. Feel the energy adding to the energy raised with the Isa meditation.

Trace the Hammer of Thor with your dominant hand using the wand or your fingers. As you trace the Thorn, say (vibrate) the word Thorn (or Thuriaz if you are using the Norse name). Visualize the energy flowing from your solar plexus, through your hand/wand, tracing the rune. Turn to the East and repeat the invocation. Then to the South, then to the West. Then Above you, then below you. Turn to the North and say: Thorn in the North, Hallow and hold this Holy Stead. Do this for the other five Thorns you have invoked.

Having invoked the six points of the circle, we will be invoking a thorny circle of briar in four parts. Each "string" will be invoked as long as you can say the word Thorn. When your breath runs out, then one should inhale and begin another string, until you have scribed four interlacing, intricate strings of etheric briar. You will be tracing these strings to create a ball similar to yarn. As you are tracing the strings of briar, visualize the briar as being covered with sharp, pointy, nasty-looking thorns. Invest these thorns with the power to keep out unwanted influences.

Stand facing North. Inhale and as you exhale, vibrate the word "Thorn." Make the vibration of the name last as long as you have breath. As you are saying the word, trace briar in a circle around you. Visualize the stream of briar coming out of the end of your wand/finger. Trace the briar in any way you want. When your breath runs out from the first "Thorn," inhale and invoke that name again, drawing a string of briar around the inner surface of a globe, forming a globe of briar with your actions. Remember to see what is already there and fill in the spaces you have yet to get to. When you are out of breath again, inhale, and begin the third string of Briar. Don't forget to get the space over your head and below your feet. Make wide sweeping motions, small scribbly motions. Let your enjoyment of movement arouse more energy, feel the energy flowing through you, through your hand, and coming out in the stream of briar. When you are out of breath, inhale, and invoke the Thorn one last time. Make sure to get all of those places that have not been covered. Fix the holes with this last invocation.

As you finish this last invocation of Thorn, stand facing North. It is not uncommon to feel both exhilarated and exhausted by this process. Stand with feet apart and hands spread over your head. Breathe deeply. Visualize the glowing ball of briar. See it, its green tendrils intertwining, feel the vibrance of its life force, a force that you have given to it. Breathe deeply, calming yourself. While standing with your feet apart, arms upraised in a "Y," inhale, and as you exhale feel your energy flowing through the orb of briar, and see, as you energize the orb, the thorns grow. See the thorns, brownish and reddish, getting larger and closing up the small spaces that existed between the strings of briar. Feel the spaces being blocked off. See the blue of the space around you, see the orb of thorny briars. Keep the thorns growing until you feel that the orb is complete and capable of keeping out any unwanted influences. Infuse the orb of briar with the ability to repel unwanted energies and permit those energies desired.

Stand in a comfortable position. We are near the end of the ritual. The invocation of the God/desses. Stand in the Isa position. Say IIIIIISsssssssss. Stand in the As (Anuz) position. Say Odhinn. Stand in the Beorch position. Say Urdh. Stand in the Ing position. Say Freyr. Stand in the Foeh position. Say Freya. Stand in the Thorn position. Say Thorr. Stand in the Isa position. Breathe deeply. Thank the God/desses silently. Feel the Orb of Thorns surrounding you. Begin your working, secure in your circle.

Certain parts of the ritual were taken from Thorrson's Hammer Rite. But the ritual is mostly original. The God/dess names at the end can be altered at your behest but try to keep Odhinn First, Freya in the middle, and Thorr last. I will be posting meditations for the Runic God/desses to help with the last part of this ritual.

May your path be filled with Wisdom and Wonder,

The Runic Sub-Committee
of
The Orgone CommitteeObserve and listen, reserving your judgment, for until all the silver is weighed, who can know the worth thereof? As like breeds like, even more so does good beget love and joy. Your life will be full of love and joy if you are joyful and happy. Your teachers are the servants of the Gods, and they shall plant the seeds of knowledge within the minds of their students, and they shall use their power for the good of the Wicca. Yet it is each individual's duty to tend the seeds which are planted, and to make the final harvest. Those who misuse the power and the trust of the teacher's position shall have to answer to the Lords of Karma and adjust the balance accordingly. The Temples of the Gods, which are Their abode on Earth, shall belong to all Their children, and each Circle shall be as a special family. Do naught against any Temple or any family of the Wicca, lest you do that thing unto the Gods, and against yourself. You must not be a teller of tales amongst the children of the Goddess, and you must hold no malice or evil thoughts towards others of the Wicca. You should not lie, nor give false testimony before your Elders, or those who are of the Wicca—for liars are fools, and a menace unto themselves, and to the Wicca. Be truthful in all your works and deeds, especially within the Circle, for what you say within the presence of the Gods becomes manifest. You must not put stumbling blocks in the way of those who do not follow the Path of the Wicca. You must make no unrighteous judgments of their ways, and you should aid them with an attitude of love when it is asked for. Yet ever should you keep the Counsel of the Elders, and reveal naught to others of where our Circles may be, nor may you reveal our ways without the consent of the Priestess. When you make a vow to the Lord or the Lady, or you swear an oath to another of the Wicca, then you must do all that has come forth from your mouth, for a covenant with the Gods, or with the Wicca, is your Honor, and woe to those who care not for the fetters they attach to their souls by not keeping their word. The Great Mother and Father would not have their children suffer the indignities of oppressors for their sake, for what is within the hearts of Their children is dear and true to Them. The Ancient and Mighty Ones shall cause the balance to be made for those who desecrate the Lord and Lady, Their temples, or Their creations. Never shall you use Magick, nor the Craft, to cause harm, for this is misuse of the Power, and it is not to be condoned. To cause the death of another through the Craft is to require the death of the Self in sacrifice. Never betray any of the brethren, nor the lore of our people, for you are all servants of the Gods, and must live by the virtues of love, honor, and wisdom. Let truth, loyalty, and honor be your creed. Let them be your guides, tempered by love and wisdom. The Order of the Gods shall you keep, and within Their Circles shall you walk. You should not say "I believe" when you doubt, nor claim to obey the Lord and Lady's word when you never enter into the Temple. You must not profess with your lips that which is not in your heart. Do not use the names of the Gods in negative or evil ways, for They love and cherish Their children above all others. All others They love, even those who know them not. Yet those who hate and curse in Their name shall have the Mighty Ones take the measure of their worth. In any disputes between the children of the Goddess, no one may invoke any laws but those of the Craft, or any tribunal but that of Priestess, Priest, and Elders. No one of the Wicca may do anything which will endanger the Craft, nor bring any of the Wicca into conflict with the Law of the Land, or with any of our persecutors. Your magickal tools are channels to that which is most precious and pure within you. Do not cheapen them by haggling their price when you acquire them. Never accept money for the use of the Power. It is sorcerers and charlatans who accept money for their spells and prayers. If you accept no money, you will be free from the temptation to use the Craft for evil or unworthy causes. You shall never take unduly from any human, animal, or elemental that which is not yours to take—for if you steal from another, in the end you will have to sacrifice something dearer to you in order to attain the balance. Show honor to all people, that they may look up to you, and respect you, and their eyes shall become a mirror for your soul. Those who are of the Wicca shall not own slaves, for one person may not own the spirit of another, for only the Great Mother and Father own our souls. Nor shall you take as a pledge any person's life, for to do so is to take upon yourself both a mill and a millstone. If a stranger sojourns with you, you shall do them no wrong; they shall be as one of the Circle, born amongst ye, and you shall deal with them as you would yourself. Just weights and just balances shall be given by you, and just value shall you give, and thereby receive threefold. Your altars shall be kept clean, pure, and holy, and all that is brought into the Temple or the Circle shall be cleansed and blessed, for the joy of the Gods, and of the Wicca. A clean mind should have a clean body. You should keep your body, your clothes, and your house clean, in honor of the Mother, who gives these things to you. Let none die without honor, without love, without respect, unless their actions have decreed otherwise. You should not couple together if it shall cause pain, jealousy, or deprivation to another by doing so. Union for malice or evil reasons such as these upsets the balance, and the Lords of the Universe shall make adjustments accordingly. Let those who would love, and would be as one, and bear child, be handfasted. For the sharing of love in this manner is beauteous, and love's union in the energy of the Gods, and the heritage of the child. It is important for children to know and to identify with those who brought them here. The Law of the Goddess is that none of the Wicca shall take and wed someone who they do not love, whether it is to harm another, or for some form of material gain. Remember that your children are Goddess-spawned, and are free spirits. You do not own nor control them. They are your brethren, come to visit for a while, that they may share in the vision of your love and wisdom. Let each parent realize that although they may teach and guide with love, the child shall also teach the parent, and aid them in their growth and lesson. The etheric web and energy vortexes of the earth are in constant flux and motion to adjust to the needs of the planet. The sacred trust of the Wicca is to create and to maintain centers of light and knowledge, using the magick of the divine spark within us to focus and channel the forces of the Universal fire. And these are the channels established between the worlds of the stars and the realms of the earth, bringing in and regulating the spirit flames which energize and activate all life forms. Thus we tend and guard the threads of creation, and we weave the patterns of life and manifestation in an ever-evolving tapestry. Never use your heritage or position for self-glorification or gain. Respect your magick and our ways. We must always recognize that while others may look to us to lead them, they too are our guides. Keep your body strong, your mind keen, and your purpose pure, for within your being you shall channel the Power, and it needs to be strong and pure. And these are the keys to the path of Oneness, and to communication with the Gods. Yet first you must learn to speak to Them in such a manner as They can comprehend you. For the children of the Wicca must aid the Gods, and work with Them, otherwise the Gods cannot aid and work with you. Ever remember that the Priest and Priestess are the living representatives of the God and Goddess Forces, and likewise that all humans carry these forces within them, though they may lie dormant and unawakened. As the Great Mother and Father come unto one another and create with the pure vibration of Love-Wisdom, so should you strive to make your Temple pure in vibration, and thus a fitting place wherein you may invite the Gods. Thus, your Circle should always be duly purified and cast, and likewise, those who would use the gateways and travel the Circle between the earth and other realms should also be duly prepared and purified. The Goddess hath said, "I shall not carry thee, yet neither shall I hinder thee, nor keep thee from having the same opportunities as all of my children. Thou art free, yet thou shalt not be coddled like babes in the storm. If thou hast true devotion within thee, then all obstacles may be overcome." The laggard is but half a person—and though half is better than none, the whole is twice as good as the half. Those who do not work, or who lack the will and desire to learn the ways of the Gods, unto them is said, "The Ancient and Mighty Ones shall not keep thee within their house, if ye learneth not." A sanctuary you shall make unto the Gods, that They may dwell amongst you. And you shall fashion it to the best of your ability, according to all that your Elders shall show you, and pure energy shall you place therein. An altar shall you make unto the Lady, and you shall make due reverence unto Her, for every place where She is exalted, She will come to you and bless you. And you shall fashion your altar out of wood or stone, and burn incense and candles thereon, at the proper times, in observance of her ways. You should set aside at least one day during each moon unto the Goddess, and on these days you shall do Her work; and on those days She shall renew Her children and bless them. Learn to build your own Temple, and to craft your own sacred Circle, and all the tools that are used therein—for to be a person of the Craft is to be a person of consequence. Let each of you inscribe your own record of our ways and teachings. For the course of each Wiccan should be charted, that the patterns of their life-web may be made known and utilized. Let each Wiccan start their Book of Light with the teachings and lore of their tradition, yet let it also contain the rites and ways of each individual, which are the harvest of each child of the Wicca, to use the wisdom of their heritage as the seeds of their own wisdom. Thus shall our lore and knowledge continue to grow and unfold, like a beautiful flower. It is right to study and to understand the sigils, statues, and stories of the Gods, for they shall guide your thoughts to Them, and They shall hear them. Yet you must ever remember that you worship not the sign nor the statue, but the Gods which inspired them. If your Circle owns any land, let all guard it, and help to keep it clean. Let all justly guard all monies of the Circle, as well as the rights and property of all members of the Circle. If any Wiccan truly labors, then it is right that they should have their just pay. This is not considered the taking of money for the Art, but good and honest work. Yet if any Wiccan works willingly for the good of the Craft, or for their brothers and sisters without pay, then it is to their greatest honor. If any Wiccan should deny themselves some pleasure or material indulgence in order to do service in the Circle, this person shall be blessed and remembered. For those who give for the greater good of all shall have their spirit uplifted. Know also that if you gift the Lady's Priests and Priestesses, or Her Circles, this is an offering made unto the Mother Herself, for a true Priest or Priestess strives always to do Her work, and to be of service to Her children, so to honor and respect them is to honor and respect the Queen of All. And the offerings which are considered the most pleasing to the Gods are these: the fruits of the orchards, the scents of the trees and herbs, the metals of the earth, the waters of the earth, the flowers of the meadows, and the milk of all mothers. Yet offerings of labor or money are honest too, and these will also be accepted—moreso if you work with love in your heart, for always there is work to be done for the Gods, and service to be given to the children of the Wicca. If your offerings are made to restore the balance, it must be of a nature that it not offensive to the Gods. It must be of value, yet given with a free heart. Thus shall the harmony be restored. If your offerings are given with a heart filled with love and devotion, or are of service to the Gods, or to the Craft, then shall you receive blessings manifold. And when you make an offering unto the Gods, you should offer it through the most proper medium, at the proper times, and in such a manner as to make it acceptable. Any and all remains of the rituals shall be consumed in the fire, or buried within the Earth, as a way of returning to the Source all that we use in the observance of our ways, thus ensuring the continuity of the cycle. All may use the Craft to help and aid them, or for the advantage of their Circle, or the Craft—yet only if you are sure that you harm none. Let each Wiccan and Circle always debate these matters at length. Only if all be satisfied that none be harmed in any way, may the Art then be used. If it is not possible to achieve your ends one way, then perhaps the goal may be achieved by acting in a different way, so as to harm none. Throughout the world it has been many a year since Wiccans have been burned. Yet misuse of the Power might raise the persecutions once again. So never break the Laws, however much you might be tempted, and never consent to their being broken. And if you know they are being broken, then you must work strongly against it. In days of old it was decided by the Mighty Ones who came before us that the Art might be used to restrain others from harming the Craft or its children, yet only after great consultation with all members of the Circle, and only then to deflect or to constrain them. And such were the ways of the Lady that She brought us forth in joy, and such were the Ways of the Lord that His reign gave all life pleasure. Offer love in your worship and all shall be joyous in beauty. In the dimly remembered dawn of ages past, the Wicca were truly free. Then, in Atlantis came the Age of the Misuse of Power, followed by the Ages of Persecution and Suffering. Thus the people of the Wicca hid themselves and cloaked their knowledge, and wove veils of secrecy and silence. And this is how the Ways of the Wicca have been preserved through the time of darkness. Yet much of the ways of our people were lost to the ignorance of others. Yet the cycle spirals ever on—and the Age of the Earth Mother once again draws nigh. We must be strong—one with our birthright, and one with our Gods, if we are to bring forth the balance. Those who would harm us, or attempt to enslave us, we must overcome—yet only through light and love, and never through violence or the evil of chaos. And through our efforts the time of our people will come into being once more. In the times which lie ahead, there lies much work to be done, so that once more the cycles of life are drawn to the path of light, and the balance achieved through the power of love. In order to bring the ways of Light and Love and Life to the peoples of the Earth, our secrets are slowly becoming secrets no more, and it is good that this is so—for the age of shadow and secrecy is passing. Yet the sharing of our ways needs always to be guided by wisdom and by love. Let our rites and our mysteries be kept sacred. Let no one defile our worship or our heritage. For the defilement of our ways is an honor loss to self, and for the Craft. Let each High Priestess govern her Circle with justice and Love, and with the help and advice of the Elders and the High Priest, always heeding the messages of the Gods when they come. Ever remember that although the Priest is the force with which the Circle is built, the Priestess is the ruler therein—for it is through her that the Goddess created the world, and all things therein. The High Priestess will heed all complaints of all Pagans and Wiccans, and strive to settle any differences between them with reason and with justice. Let each Circle of Light decide how it shall be known—whether by earthly name or magickal one. For each child of the Wicca knows best the safety or dangers of their homeland. Let each Circle or Temple maintain and dedicate unto the Goddess and the God all the things that are required for Their rituals, for what is blessed in the name of the Gods rightly belongs to Them, and the Priest and Priestess shall be the caretakers thereof. Anyone of the circle who is of sufficient rank, and wishes to form a new Circle, shall tell the High Priestess and the Elders of their intentions. Members of the old Circle may join the new Circle when it is formed, but if they do so they must leave the other Circle, unless otherwise instructed. For it is the Old Law that each Wiccan may join the Circle of their choice, yet their energy should not be divided between two or more Temples. The Elders of the old and new Circles shall meet in peace and with respect, to decide the level of interaction and connection between the Circles. Yet it is known that the splitting of a Circle often means strife. So only if it is truly in a spirit of peace and harmony should the Circles meet for the celebration of the Great Festivals. None shall enter the Circle that have a sickness or an ailment which may be passed on to the Lady's other children—for to do so causes harm to yourself, as well as to the others of the Circle. Rather should the Healers go unto the sick one, that through the love of the Gods they shall be made well and whole once more. It has been judged lawful that if any of the Craft need a house, or land, and none will sell, to incline someone's mind so as to be willing to sell, providing it harms none and the full price is paid without haggling. In the matter of quarrels or disputes between the members of the Circle, the High Priestess shall convene the Council, and inquire into the matter. The Council shall hear each person privately, and then both together. And they shall decide justly, not favoring one side nor the other. If an agreeable resolution cannot be reached, then that Wiccan must leave the Circle, for a Circle of Light cannot be properly formed where there is disagreement and discord. And when a Circle is not properlyDocument Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

In the land of Oz lived a great Wizard named Albert Creemshaw. He was loved by everyone and became quite popular when he destroyed the Last Dragon in a great battle between the forces of oppression and the powers of Freedom. When the villagers heard that the monster had been killed, they rushed to the mountainside where the Dragon had its nest and proceeded to break the eggs, thereby ensuring the destruction of the creatures forever. What they did not know was that Albert had snuck one of the eggs out before the villagers got there. He cared for it in his Castle and through his great magical ability, he was able to genetically alter the dragon fetus so that it would soon be the watcher of the people; a symbol of freedom and great strength. But he kept this a secret from the people because they were not ready yet for the trial which awaited them; they would have just ganged up and tried to kill the Little Dragon. He became a Hermit and loved the little creature.

One day the Wizard received a message from his God that he would have to move on and release his body the way that a butterfly sheds its cocoon. So Albert called for the Council of The Sword and Shield, a ruling body of his most trusted students, and told them about the little dragon. At first, they were repulsed by the idea of bringing up the offspring of the object of their misery, but the Magician persuaded them by telling them that the little dragon would soon be the symbol of freedom and strength: they swore by the Warrior Gods they would care for it. The following evening, while the Full Moon shined on the peaceful waters of Oz, Albert and his God left forever.

Upon finding their Master dead, the Council released the information about the Little Dragon to the people of Oz. The people of Oz loved Albert as much as he loved them, and after they saw how fragile this poor orphaned creature was, they decided amongst themselves that they would honor those raising the little dragon, for the dragon would represent all of the things Albert himself stood for.

Things went well for a while. The favoritism displayed by the people of Oz towards the Priests and Priestesses that cared for the Dragon created turmoil: all of a sudden there were power struggles within the Council, its members were fighting over who would supervise the education of the Little Dragon, who would feed it, who would educate it. They set up rules specifically designed to make it impossible for others to reach the grades appropriate to caring for the Dragon so that only a few on top could reap the benefits associated with caring for the Little Dragon.

One would say: "I have risked my life and given all so that the little dragon could have food," and his ego was pleased. The other would say: "While you first despised the dragon I stood fast in my duty to care for it, for I have kept my word," and her ego was satisfied. The people were so impressed by the "devotion and selflessness" of The Council that certain members were given gifts of silver, gold, spices, and women. Treated as Gods for their sense of duty.

Everyone at The Council became so preoccupied with the power struggle, and with keeping their peers in lower positions that they forgot about the little, fragile Dragon. When they finally gained their senses and returned to the Castle where it was guarded, they found it dead, starved from attention and sustenance. They then realized that empty, lost feeling Albert himself would have felt if HE had killed the Last Dragon.In Physics, Man is known as 'the monad'. We shall discuss the nature of the monad or 'Star' from the Enochian view.

MONAD MODEL

In conjunction with the Cosmic Planes and Elements Model, Enochian Physics proposes the Enochian Monad Model. These two models are not meant to be independent; rather, they are inclusive and only separated for convenience.

A monad is defined as an indivisible unit (Hadit) but is used in the sense that a monad is the infinitely small conscious point of every entity. The only difference between monads is experience. Giordano Bruno taught that the monad was the ultimate spiritual particle and that all entities had a monad at their center, the core of their being. Every monad is monastic above the first Aethyr (LIL) and is dualistic below. This duality takes many forms as the monad manifests itself downward. Basically, it consists of a subjective self in the center of an objective world. Figure 2 shows a pictorial representation of this model.

ENOCHIAN AXIOMS

1. Man, and every entity (thing) in existence, is in his (its) essence a monad. This monadic essence expresses itself as a subjective 'I' and an objective 'NOT-I'.
2. A monad's geometric equivalent is the sphere. The center is the 'I'. The surface of the sphere is the 'NOT-I'.
3. The 'I' is conscious individuality.
4. The 'NOT-I' is the world in which the 'I' finds itself at any given point in time and space.
5. Every geometric point in space is an 'I-NOT-I' monad in some stage of self-expression.
6. Any 'I' can communicate with any other 'I' only insofar as their 'NOT-I's' intersect.
7. A world is defined as a set of intersections of a host of 'NOT-I's' at any given point in time and space.
8. Subsets of 'I's' are mutually exclusive.
9. Subsets of 'NOT-I's' may be either exclusive or inclusive.
10. The monadic essence of each monad allows multitudinous expression, but no 'I' can ever separate itself from or exist independently of its 'NOT-I'.

THEOREMS OF ENOCHIAN PHYSICS

1. Every person is an 'I-NOT-I' monad.
2. Every point in space is a consciousness center.
3. Energy flows from one cosmic plane or sub-plane to an adjacent cosmic plane or sub-plane through Laya centers, dimensionless points of space which serve as channels for the flow of energies and forces.
4. Spirit is unmanifested energy. Matter is manifested energy.
5. Every manifestation within space and time is dualistic.
6. Space, time, and consciousness come into existence simultaneously.
7. Every energy field and every force in our universe is directed by the True Will.

THE FORCES OF MAGICK

There are six Magickal forces that are manifested in existence. These six forces, by necessity, manifest in dual triads, the upper, and the lower.

THE UPPER TRIAD

1. Divine Force. This is said to be the "Supreme Force" relative to our universe. This so-called 'Supreme Force' is known as 'The TRUE WILL'. It is the 'Divine' driving force of Hadit.
2. Creative Force. The Kundalini of Eastern thought, manifesting below the Abyss, as electromagnetic energy.
3. Thought Force. This is the occult force that often takes the form of projection and continually projects fundamental subjective ideas of the 'I' outward into the 'NOT-I'.

THE LOWER TRIAD

1. Mind Force. This force should properly be called 'Intellectual', and would be attributed to Mercury. This is the reasoning and logical powers of the intelligent entity. This force also includes all of the senses.
2. Will Force. This is the lower manifestation of the 'Divine Force'. This force is what drives us in a physical sense; it is our outer needs and desires. It is what most 'men' perceive as their 'will', however, it is frequently the opposite side of the 'Will Duality'.
3. Word Force. Words and Letters, speech and physical action make up this aspect of the magickal forces. It is the power of sound, which has long been known in the west. God is said to create by uttering His Word. Consider this; some politicians are virtual masters of this magickal force.

As can be seen, there is little real difference between the Enochian view of man and that of the Thelemic Magician, with the main differences being that of nomenclature. It can also be seen that the six 'magical forces' generally correspond to the five divisions of man as set forth by Crowley, with the exception of the sixth 'force'. This extra point is comprised of the actions performed by the first five. If we think of man as a hexagram, instead of a pentagram, we have the four elements, spirit, and motion.

The elements and spirit make up the essential man, but he is still static. With the addition of the sixth, he becomes dynamic, capable of experience. It is then this 'man' that has the 'essences of man', for until he becomes dynamic by virtue of his motion, and gains in experience, he is incapable of attainment.

As was stated above, Man's aspiration is to a higher place in the hierarchy of the universe. Here then are the Laws of Hierarchies, they will show, though perhaps not directly, how this ascension (attainment) is made possible.

HIERARCHIES

Law of Hierarchies. From the highest realms of spirit to the lowest levels of matter, everything in between is composed of a host of gods, monads, or life atoms arranged in a myriad of hierarchies.

The following rules apply:

1. All aggregates are composed of hierarchies. All things, save Hadit, are aggregates. We see in our world complete structures, which are composed of molecules, atoms, and sub-atomic particles in one direction. And planets, solar systems, and galaxies in another. Thus science has enabled us to see, on a mundane level, that our physical universe is composed of some basic hierarchies. Though from rules 3 and 4 we see that these hierarchies continue unto infinity.
2. For every hierarchy, there is a governing ruler or hierarch. On our personal level, we have that which is referred to as our Holy Guardian Angel. As we descend to the atomic level, we have the nucleus of the atom. Each component of that atom has, in turn, its own hierarch. In our worldly governments, we see examples of these hierarchs; mayors, governors, presidents, etc. And we can begin to see our place in the physical manifestation of these hierarchies. We are also members of hierarchies on less physical, or spiritual levels, though little is known of these.
3. Hierarchies descend infinitely into matter. Again, from our 'middle world, we see the manifestation of yet smaller structures or hierarchies, which descend to the smallest particles which science is able to see or theorize.
4. Hierarchies ascend infinitely into spirit. On these levels, little is known, science has or can not enter into the realm of spirit. We do know, however, that our own personal hierarch is our H.G.A., and that logically we are but a component part of some yet higher structure or hierarchy.
5. The universe has a hierarchical structure, interlinking groups of entities living and working together. If we look sky-ward we can begin to see something of this structure on a physical level. Our stellar universe is made up of planets, solar systems, stellar clusters, galaxies, and on and on. While earth is not yet working with other groups of entities on a stellar level (as far as we are allowed to know), it is clear that we must share the same stellar environment with others. We can, however, observe this 'working together' here on planet earth. We can see the governments of cities, counties, states, and countries working toward what is perceived as the common good (at least in most cases).
6. Hierarchies are born, evolve, and die. The best example of this, I think, is ourselves. We are born into this world, grow and experience (evolve) over some period of time then die, this is all a part of what we call 'life'. Other examples of this rule may be seen in various extinct forms of animal life, which came into existence, evolved over time, then died out. We can also see examples on the stellar level, stars which are born from collections of gases, grow and evolve into fiery furnaces, then die out.
7. Worlds are created by hierarchies of cosmic builders and architects acting together.
8. Every world contains hierarchies of recorders who constitute the forces of karmic history.
9. The cosmic elements and planes are composed of countless hosts of evolving hierarchies.

These last two rules are for the most part redundant (see 3 and 4 above); they serve to stress the fact that hierarchies do, in fact, extend infinitely in all directions.

10. Every hierarchy is composed of a host of smaller hierarchies.
11. Every hierarchy is a component part of a larger hierarchy.

Thus we have the Enochian view on the nature, place, and path of Man. To better understand this mystery of the true meaning of A.`. A.'. and this nature of man we may now look at some of the Temurahs of the number 451.

These are; 451, 415, 541, 514, 145, and 154. We shall start with the least of these.

The number 145; In Sepher Sephiroth it is defined as the numerical value of the 13 paths of the Beard of Microprosopus.

The number 154; Again from Sepher Sephiroth; it is 'Elohim of Loves', and we are referred to the number 149. The reference in 149 is to 'The living GODS'.

In these two numbers we have references to Man and this 'Starry' nature. Though in the number 149 it is perhaps more direct. 'The living GODS', indeed, the most tangible link between man and GOD is this 'Starry' essence. Both Man and ANY GOD that one cares to think of are at the core one and the same, that is to say, that we are all made of the same stuff, we are all MONADS at some level of evolution. But, on we go.

The number 415; Still again from Sepher Sephiroth. The number is that of the Voice of the Chief Seer and also 'The Holy One'.

Still again subtle references to this 'Star' nature which we have already examined.

The number 514 and 541. Here are references that are a bit more obscure. 514 gives reference to 'KABBALA DENUDATA', a reference that unfortunately I will have to pass on due to a misfortune beyond my control. The number 541 refers to 'Israel', which at first may seem strange, but, historically Israel is/are 'Gods' chosen people. We may take this to mean 'Free Man' in the Thelemic sense. The number is thus indicating Man, or rather those Men that have risen above the slavery of the old aeon and have begun to ascend/aspire to Yetzirah. Those Men who have realized some small part of their true essence.

So then! Just what the hell is the true meaning of the initials A.`. A.'. and the number 451? It is no more and surely no less than the MONAD! Though others may use different words and different systems to explain this, their meaning will of necessity be the same.The text discusses the nature of the monad or 'Star' from the Enochian view, proposing the Enochian Monad Model in conjunction with the Cosmic Planes and Elements Model. A monad is defined as an indivisible unit, representing the infinitely small conscious point of every entity, with differences based on experience. Giordano Bruno taught that the monad was the ultimate spiritual particle, with every entity having a monad at its core. The monad is monastic above the first Aethyr (LIL) and dualistic below, manifesting as a subjective self in the center of an objective world.

The Enochian Axioms outline the nature of the monad, its geometric equivalent as a sphere, and the relationship between the 'I' (conscious individuality) and the 'NOT-I' (the world). Theorems of Enochian Physics describe the flow of energy through cosmic planes, the dualistic nature of manifestations, and the direction of energy fields by the True Will.

The text also details the six Magickal forces, divided into the upper and lower triads, and their manifestations in existence. The upper triad includes Divine Force, Creative Force, and Thought Force, while the lower triad includes Mind Force, Will Force, and Word Force.

The Laws of Hierarchies explain the hierarchical structure of the universe, from the highest realms of spirit to the lowest levels of matter, with governing rulers or hierarchs at each level. The text emphasizes the interconnectedness of hierarchies and their infinite descent into matter and ascent into spirit.

The document further explores the true meaning of the initials A.`. A.'. and the number 451, relating them to the monad and the nature of man. It references various numbers and their significance in Sepher Sephiroth, highlighting the connection between man and the divine.

The text concludes with a discussion on the nature of consciousness, the process of self-recognition and maintenance, and the impact of diet and health on magical experiences. It emphasizes the importance of a healthy lifestyle, moderation, and the use of pranayama (controlled breathing) for relaxation and mental clarity.**MAGICK 7 -- BASIC RITUAL**

The first part of every ceremony is the banishing; the second the invoking. Ritual is the heart of magick, through which we achieve our magical results. Ritual is a procedure or ceremony performed to change the environment, often resulting in subjective changes in the physical world. Outsiders may dismiss these as coincidences, but the effects are real. Magical goals for a ritual should be taken seriously.

The successful practice of magick depends on strong belief. The simplest ritual is belief itself. If you believe in your desired results strongly enough, that act is a magical ritual that will achieve your results. Even a complex ritual is no more effective than strong belief. Aids to concentration, such as creative visualization, imagination, and controlled breathing, can help.

**CREATIVE VISUALIZATION**

When you want to achieve something magically, first picture it clearly in your mind. The more definite and specific your idea, the better. Picture yourself having it or doing it. Visualize it as vividly and intensely as you can and hold it in your thoughts for a few moments. Concentrate on it intensely. Feel the energy of desire welling up inside you. Then suddenly feel the image or desire released from your mind. Feel the energy filtering through the image and intensifying it, as if the image is a 'stencil'. Imagine the energy exploding out from you into the macrocosm in all directions at once. Feel the energy draining from you. Finally, believe that your purpose has been accomplished; that it has happened, perhaps saying something such as "so mote it be" or "it is done".

**THE BASIC PARTS OF A RITUAL**

Often rituals are more formal than the above, but any full magick ritual must always reduce to these stages: 1) imaging; 2) building; 3) firing. Sometimes a ritual must be repeated every day for a while to achieve difficult results or to overcome weak belief.

**THE MAGICK CIRCLE**

An important part of formal ritual is the magick circle. Medieval magicians considered the circle essential and placed great emphasis on its exactness. Elaborate designs were invented with many layers of complex symbols and words. It was very important that the circle be completely intact with no breaks in it. The magician and any other participants stand in the circle during the ritual. The ritual began with a banishing of evil forces to keep them outside the circle. Today, circles are made on the floor with chalk or paint, rock salt, or a rope. Whatever its form, the circle is still an important part of magical protection for the magician. This is especially important for aversive entities and purposes. The circle also helps in focusing the energy of the ritual toward its purpose, keeping it contained until the magician is ready to release it. The magick circle is basically a symbol, but it may eventually be possible to supplement the circle with electronic equipment for a similar purpose.

**ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS**

An artificial elemental is useful for certain tasks: 1) invisible watcher and observer, telling you what it sees; 2) psychic guard; 3) it can be used in healing; 4) it is helpful in other ways. Ophiel calls the artificial elemental a 'familiar'. Producing your own artificial elemental is fairly easy. You must assume that the act has produced results, even if you do not immediately observe them. It is entirely possible to produce one of these little beings and not know it. Therefore, never ignore forces you have set into motion. Even though you may not see the elemental, you may nevertheless 'feel' it.

**WARNING**: Do not use artificial elementals for any kind of aversive magick at this point; they can be difficult to get rid of. Should you have to eliminate one of them which you created in error, you must re-absorb it back into yourself through your will; or in some cases, you can 'exorcise' it.

**HOW TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTAL**

You can create your own artificial elemental for various purposes. An artificial elemental is basically a thoughtform strengthened with emotion. Refer to the aura color chart and decide what color to make the elemental, based on your intended purpose. Apple green is a good choice for general purposes. Then decide on a shape or outline. Do you want your elemental to resemble some sort of animal? A simple circle or cloud is a good place to start. With this in mind, you can use ritual to create your elemental. Creative visualization is good for this. Visualize it glowing before you. A darkened room is helpful for this. Communicate with your elemental with telepathy, by talking to it, or with creative visualization. Your artificial elemental is closely linked to you and your subconscious attitudes. It will generally not do things you think it cannot do. As in any magick, results relate to effort and belief. Another way of looking at an artificial elemental is as an aspect of your personality (sub-personality) which has been detached from you.

**INVOCATION**

Formal ritual usually involves the invocation (ritually calling up) of a god or goddess, spirit, or other entity. In this sense, magick is somewhat similar to pagan religion and witchcraft. However, we consider magick ritual a technique, not a religion. Worship need not be involved. Sometimes the invocation of an entity creates an artificial elemental. Crowley says there are three different kinds of invocation: 1) Devotion to the entity; 2) Ceremonial invocation; 3) Drama, usually needing more than one person.

Because of the microcosm-macrocosm identity, when you invoke the gods, you are invoking aspects of yourself. Jung has referred to the gods as primitive archetypes. This makes it sound like spiritual entities are illusions. But in fact, the microcosm-macrocosm identity does not discredit the gods and goddesses. It instead helps to illustrate our relationship to the cosmos.

**CAUTIONS**

1. Balance is important in magick. Vary the entities invoked to keep your personality in balance.
2. Often as not, a ritual may produce side-effects, usually something similar to, though not exactly the desired goal. If the true goal is delayed, we may see the side effects first. And if for some reason the goal is not achieved at all, the side effects may be pronounced.
3. We may say with certainty that "something always happens" when we perform a magick ritual. But like everything else, magick follows the 'law of results'. This means that results require effort of some kind. And if you don't work hard enough at it, you don't get results. Difficult goals have greater resistance (magical inertia) to overcome. If the ritual doesn't produce the desired results, there is a good chance that the reason for the failure is within ourselves. Be certain there is no contradiction between your model and your magical goals. Sometimes self-doubt and mental contradictions may interfere. The first step in magick is to re-program your model. And, of course, you can help your magical results by working on the physical level toward your goals. Don't expect them to fall into your lap by themselves.
4. A peculiar quality of magick is time displacement. Results of a ritual are not usually instantaneous. There is often a delay of 12 hours or more. Difficult tasks or weakly performed rituals are more likely to be delayed. In most cases, a slight delay is alright, and it gives us time to get used to the coming changes. And sometimes the effects of a ritual appear to extend to before the ritual was performed!
5. Because of the way magick works, a ritual may create an emphasis in what is sought, and a de-emphasis in everything else. Balance is therefore important here. Once the magical result is achieved, it may be 'bound' to you and difficult to get rid of should you later decide to do so. Consider your magical goals wisely so you don't get stuck with something you don't really want. Note that theory says you can always unbind through ritual what was bound to you...theory says.
6. Sometimes the environment appears to react against the magick after the results are achieved. This is particularly noticeable in using magick to affect the weather. For example, your performance of a ritual to produce a sunny day produces a sunny day. The next day is sunny, alright, but the rest of the month is cold and overcast. Here the weather seems to react to the magick in the opposite way to re-establish its natural balance. It is something like pushing a pendulum to one side and releasing it -- the pendulum swings to the other side. To quote Emmerson -- "For everything you gain you lose something...". I don't know that this is always true in magick, but it does illustrate the point. And another reason not to use magick to affect the weather is that it might foul it up in other parts of the country (world??).
7. Finally, magick ritual (or any magick or occultism) is very dangerous for the mentally unstable. If you should somehow 'get out too far', eat 'heavy foods' as previously discussed and use your religious background or old belief system for support. But remember too, that weird experiences are not necessarily bad experiences.

Taylor, Isaac, Greeks and Goths: A Study on the Runes (MacFrom the moment that two cells form a zygote, we see the interaction of informational processes: recognition, communication, interaction, integration, re-stabilization, and reproduction or re-structurization. This cycle of life can be seen from the barest combinations of any two elemental components beginning at the lowest atomic designations of energy and throughout the continuum of increasing complexity—perhaps far beyond our capabilities to understand. If consciousness can be defined as an awareness of integrity through this process of self-recognition, then consciousness can be easily applied to that which is non-human.

From the most basic interactions of chemistry, we find that even on an atomic level there is a form of consciousness. We have become aware of the atom's necessary maintenance of its own structure through the evidence of necessary balancing of protons, neutrons, and electrons; the importance of electron shell valences is also a reminder of this type of integrity. Even on an atomic level, there is a form of awareness of self-integrity in order to maintain structure and identity.

This process of awareness is also a genius of discrimination. A form of identification of self and non-self on an energetic level. There is a borrowing, and sometimes a sharing energetically, yet when this process of self-recognition begins to fail, we see the destruction of the matter it involves. This is evident with atomic structure and also evident at the human level in the study of cancer. Therefore, we might look at this process of self-recognition and maintenance and examine its nature in order to find its function and capabilities.

When we look at different types of matter, we find that the more simple the atomic structure of the mass, the less complex its process of consciousness needs to be. Things which are comprised of only one atomic component do not need complex processes of communication between those components. Thus, the level of consciousness is rather low on an evolutionary scale of creativity, yet we also see that these types of things are far more stable in regards to their integrity—far less vulnerable to destruction. For example, it takes an enormously concentrated force of heat to break the integrity of an atom, yet a mere 2000-degree flame will not only destroy the integrity of human consciousness but also destroy the integrity of the individual component molecules which form the material mass of a human to their lowest forms as individual atoms.

When we look at the forces involved in the communication of energy, we see a flowing medium of different frequencies within a single spectrum of energetic potential. Elemental energies and forces (light, sound, temperature, pressure, magnetism, electricity) differentiate and vary in intensity and frequency yet are very alike in that they are all means of transferring energy as a form of communication which can be informative/stabilizing or disinformative/destructive, depending on the structure of the consciousness they encounter. It may be perceived that the more complex the structure, the lower the frequency of the integrity of that structure and the more vulnerable that structure is to disinformation.

The more diverse the components that are included within a thing, and the more efficient the means of communication within the structure of that thing, the lower the common denomination of frequency of integrity must be in order that the informational frequency will not be destructive to any of the component parts. To analyze this statement, we must look at other analogies within our environment. Firstly, I would like to examine the nature of sound.

Sound waves come in varying frequencies and modulations, and as humans, we assign different notes to those steps within the frequency spectrum which we can differentiate and perceive. If we play several notes simultaneously, we find that in order to maintain a balance harmonically, we must play notes that match each other's modulation. You can play a "C" note at any octave and, in fact, play all "C" notes simultaneously, and you will find that within the frequency range, these notes will complement each other; in fact, they will contribute/share energy with each other. We find similar matching if we look at musical chording. If you play the notes "F" and "C," the sharing of energy vibrationally between those two ranges of frequency will, in fact, create the note of "A" in the range in which the two notes' frequencies overlap. In this way, communication is informative, and in fact, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Similarly, playing two notes which lie in the same modulation frequencies simultaneously will increase the duration of the vibration compared to the duration if each note were played alone.

When we examine the sharing of electrical information at an atomic level, we see that through the temporary sharing of electrons in a phase path also indicates something that we might consider as investing a thing (atom) with more than the sum of its parts. Similarly, in using electric frequencies in a series, we store information on silicon chips which invest them with more than they would be if one simply looked at the electrical and silicon components alone. This transference of energy is also a transference of information in frequencies which, in many ways, we are still attempting to understand.

Simple, one-component things can sustain far higher frequencies of energetic transmission than can complex components of things. Frequencies which pass freely through atoms ultimately destroy complex things such as humans when they are subject to them. It appears that the more complex the union of the components, the slower and more tediously complex the transformation of data must be. The more complex a thing is, the lower the vibrational capability it sustains in order to maintain the integrity of its own structure.

Energetic communication exists infinitely throughout the universe. The transference of information through radio waves and light waves continues back in time to the occasion of what was known as the Big Bang. It may be that in the future we will find that in the same way gravity and electromagnetism are also continuums of information from times long past. Scientifically, we study these energetic continuums and yet we doubt and deny the holistic communicative nature of the universe. We search for causes and effects within the realms of our limited perceptions and are amazed when we can find no causal effects to explain change.

When we examine biological life, we find that each evolutionary adaptation seems to be an extension of the process of self/non-self awareness and maintenance of integrity. Not only do we see intensification of sensory perceptual abilities, but also we note that the integrational and responsive/reactive components of the process also have to evolve and adapt in order to stay integrated with the rest of the consciousness. Amoebas are simple life forms, and yet we can examine them and see that each organic component within that life form serves as an informational and communicative component within the process of maintaining the integrity (life) of the whole. When this communication process or any part of it ceases, the organization of the organism begins to deteriorate and eventually ceases and dies. In biological life, we find that though we have maintained the use of electronic communication on some neural levels, we have sunk to the depths of transferring actual molecular compounds (proteins, amino acids) in most of our organic processes. Even the human brain, supposed highest achievement of organic life forms, requires base molecular salts in order to process electrical information. Our complexity denies us the speed of light, radio, and other faster and higher frequency modes of communication except from outside of ourselves.

The human consciousness is a genius of discrimination. We use the abilities of discrimination to identify those stimuli which come from outside of our biological forms in order to protect and maintain our integrity (life). We use our senses (inefficient though they may be) to gather and interpret pure energetic communications such as the radiated energy of sunlight, and we are so inefficient at interpreting that data that we can only sense light and heat, and it destroys those sensors that gather that information through blindness and sunburn if we continue too long in our attempts. Yet, conversely, we need the information from sunlight which stimulates our organic forms into producing vitamin D (without which we would die). Is this a remnant of photosynthetic capabilities from less complex integrations, or merely a new attempt at further increasing our potential?

As organic forms of consciousness, we are sorely limited in our perceptions of the universe. Limited in exploring the possibly limitless ranges of energetic exchange simply due to the limits placed upon communication due to the complexity of our component structure. Yet rather than admit to our limitations, we seek further exploration through the development of tools made from things less complex than ourselves. In the laboratory, we use light waves and shaped silicon to create microscopes to increase our sense of visual acuity within the spectrum of visible radiation imaging. In the studio, we use simple cones, flattened vegetable matter, and electronic amplification to create tools to compensate for our limited aural perception. We have created many tools out of simpler and less complex components in order to reach those higher frequencies of information which are either so far removed from us as to be imperceptible, or so destructive to us that we dare not experience them ourselves.

The human zygote from the moment of conception is a discriminating consciousness.From the moment that two cells form a zygote, we see the interaction of informational processes: recognition, communication, interaction, integration, re-stabilization, and reproduction or re-structurization. This cycle of life can be seen from the barest combinations of any two elemental components beginning at the lowest atomic designations of energy and throughout the continuum of increasing complexity—perhaps far beyond our capabilities to understand. If consciousness can be defined as an awareness of integrity through this process of self-recognition, then consciousness can be easily applied to that which is non-human.

From the most basic interactions of chemistry, we find that even on an atomic level there is a form of consciousness. We have become aware of the atom's necessary maintenance of its own structure through the evidence of necessary balancing of protons, neutrons, and electrons; the importance of electron shell valences is also a reminder of this type of integrity. Even on an atomic level, there is a form of awareness of self-integrity in order to maintain structure and identity.

This process of awareness is also a genius of discrimination. A form of identification of self and non-self on an energetic level. There is a borrowing, and sometimes a sharing energetically, yet when this process of self-recognition begins to fail, we see the destruction of the matter it involves. This is evident with atomic structure and also evident at the human level in the study of cancer. Therefore, we might look at this process of self-recognition and maintenance and examine its nature in order to find its function and capabilities.

When we look at different types of matter, we find that the more simple the atomic structure of the mass, the less complex its process of consciousness needs to be. Things which are comprised of only one atomic component do not need complex processes of communication between those components. Thus, the level of consciousness is rather low on an evolutionary scale of creativity, yet we also see that these types of things are far more stable in regards to their integrity—far less vulnerable to destruction. For example, it takes an enormously concentrated force of heat to break the integrity of an atom, yet a mere 2000-degree flame will not only destroy the integrity of human consciousness but also destroy the integrity of the individual component molecules which form the material mass of a human to their lowest forms as individual atoms.

When we look at the forces involved in the communication of energy, we see a flowing medium of different frequencies within a single spectrum of energetic potential. Elemental energies and forces (light, sound, temperature, pressure, magnetism, electricity) differentiate and vary in intensity and frequency yet are very alike in that they are all means of transferring energy as a form of communication which can be informative/stabilizing or disinformative/destructive, depending on the structure of the consciousness they encounter. It may be perceived that the more complex the structure, the lower the frequency of the integrity of that structure and the more vulnerable that structure is to disinformation.

The more diverse the components that are included within a thing, and the more efficient the means of communication within the structure of that thing, the lower the common denomination of frequency of integrity must be in order that the informational frequency will not be destructive to any of the component parts. To analyze this statement, we must look at other analogies within our environment. Firstly, I would like to examine the nature of sound.

Sound waves come in varying frequencies and modulations, and as humans, we assign different notes to those steps within the frequency spectrum which we can differentiate and perceive. If we play several notes simultaneously, we find that in order to maintain a balance harmonically, we must play notes that match each other's modulation. You can play a "C" note at any octave and, in fact, play all "C" notes simultaneously, and you will find that within the frequency range, these notes will complement each other; in fact, they will contribute/share energy with each other. We find similar matching if we look at musical chording. If you play the notes "F" and "C," the sharing of energy vibrationally between those two ranges of frequency will, in fact, create the note of "A" in the range in which the two notes' frequencies overlap. In this way, communication is informative, and in fact, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Similarly, playing two notes which lie in the same modulation frequencies simultaneously will increase the duration of the vibration compared to the duration if each note were played alone.

When we examine the sharing of electrical information at an atomic level, we see that through the temporary sharing of electrons in a phase path also indicates something that we might consider as investing a thing (atom) with more than the sum of its parts. Similarly, in using electric frequencies in a series, we store information on silicon chips which invest them with more than they would be if one simply looked at the electrical and silicon components alone. This transference of energy is also a transference of information in frequencies which, in many ways, we are still attempting to understand.

Simple, one-component things can sustain far higher frequencies of energetic transmission than can complex components of things. Frequencies which pass freely through atoms ultimately destroy complex things such as humans when they are subject to them. It appears that the more complex the union of the components, the slower and more tediously complex the transformation of data must be. The more complex a thing is, the lower the vibrational capability it sustains in order to maintain the integrity of its own structure.

Energetic communication exists infinitely throughout the universe. The transference of information through radio waves and light waves continues back in time to the occasion of what was known as the Big Bang. It may be that in the future we will find that in the same way gravity and electromagnetism are also continuums of information from times long past. Scientifically, we study these energetic continuums and yet we doubt and deny the holistic communicative nature of the universe. We search for causes and effects within the realms of our limited perceptions and are amazed when we can find no causal effects to explain change.

When we examine biological life, we find that each evolutionary adaptation seems to be an extension of the process of self/non-self awareness and maintenance of integrity. Not only do we see intensification of sensory perceptual abilities, but also we note that the integrational and responsive/reactive components of the process also have to evolve and adapt in order to stay integrated with the rest of the consciousness. Amoebas are simple life forms, and yet we can examine them and see that each organic component within that life form serves as an informational and communicative component within the process of maintaining the integrity (life) of the whole. When this communication process or any part of it ceases, the organization of the organism begins to deteriorate and eventually ceases and dies. In biological life, we find that though we have maintained the use of electronic communication on some neural levels, we have sunk to the depths of transferring actual molecular compounds (proteins, amino acids) in most of our organic processes. Even the human brain, supposed highest achievement of organic life forms, requires base molecular salts in order to process electrical information. Our complexity denies us the speed of light, radio, and other faster and higher frequency modes of communication except from outside of ourselves.

The human consciousness is a genius of discrimination. We use the abilities of discrimination to identify those stimuli which come from outside of our biological forms in order to protect and maintain our integrity (life). We use our senses (inefficient though they may be) to gather and interpret pure energetic communications such as the radiated energy of sunlight, and we are so inefficient at interpreting that data that we can only sense light and heat, and it destroys those sensors that gather that information through blindness and sunburn if we continue too long in our attempts. Yet, conversely, we need the information from sunlight which stimulates our organic forms into producing vitamin D (without which we would die). Is this a remnant of photosynthetic capabilities from less complex integrations, or merely a new attempt at further increasing our potential?

As organic forms of consciousness, we are sorely limited in our perceptions of the universe. Limited in exploring the possibly limitless ranges of energetic exchange simply due to the limits placed upon communication due to the complexity of our component structure. Yet rather than admit to our limitations, we seek further exploration through the development of tools made from things less complex than ourselves. In the laboratory, we use light waves and shaped silicon to create microscopes to increase our sense of visual acuity within the spectrum of visible radiation imaging. In the studio, we use simple cones, flattened vegetable matter, and electronic amplification to create tools to compensate for our limited aural perception. We have created many tools out of simpler and less complex components in order to reach those higher frequencies of information which are either so far removed from us as to be imperceptible, or so destructive to us that we dare not experience them ourselves.

The human zygote from the moment of conception is a discriminating consciousness. It is involved in the differentialization of its components in order to develop finer levels of complexity. This fetus is also, even before birth, learning to interpret communicative energies from the outer world in order to begin the definition of itself, its integrity, and its maintenance of self apart from the influence of "other." Cells join together in communication to form cooperative systems, each with separate responsibilities to the whole. Organs with specific functions support the organism in its fight to maintain its integrity. Consciousness of Mind determines the difference between self and non-self, regulating the integrity of the whole. This harmony of components within a symphony of orchestration is the matter of being alive.

Despite our complexities, despite recognition of our vulnerabilities and limitations, we as humans are beings of arrogant mind. We claim supremacy over all biological organisms and claim the sole right to conscious thought as if we were the only form of communication we wished to recognize. We deny our insecurities and lay claims to great understandings concerning the universe when we, in fact, do not even understand the actual workings of our own process of integration and communication within our own biological forms. We claim ownership of consciousness, yet we do not even pretend to truly evaluate the process of consciousness nor its beginnings.

Despite our inadequacies, we assume to know the nature of the beginnings of all life. We claim to know the "mind" of "God" (the prime causation for all that exists) and we claim title to superiority in emulation of this "God" - above and beyond all other forms of life or integrity. An egotistic lot are we, who strive to seek security in the midst of our fear, our inadequacies, our vulnerabilities, by developing a system of belief which guarantees our security in a place beyond our perception. We seek safety and foundation at the same time that we reach outward to claim flight amongst the stars.

This is the paradox of humanity, of mind. Complexity found in simplicity, using simplicity to explore a universe beyond the range of our complex integrity. Our complex integrity is vulnerable to all but the simplest energies, while we lay grasp to use complex energies which would destroy us in order to prove our strength. What it is we look for, we eventually find at the expense of closing our senses to see what really is. Perhaps it is true that the most foolish are those who lay claim to knowledge for they have closed their minds to further learning, and that the most wise are those who claim knowledge of no thing, that they may learn all.Observe and listen, reserving your judgment, for until all the silver is weighed, who can know the worth thereof? As like breeds like, even more so does good beget love and joy. Your life will be full of love and joy if you are joyful and happy. Your teachers are the servants of the Gods, and they shall plant the seeds of knowledge within the minds of their students, and they shall use their power for the good of the Wicca. Yet it is each individual's duty to tend the seeds which are planted, and to make the final harvest. Those who misuse the power and the trust of the teacher's position shall have to answer to the Lords of Karma, and adjust the balance accordingly. The Temples of the Gods, which are Their abode on Earth, shall belong to all Their children, and each Circle shall be as a special family. Do naught against any Temple or any family of the Wicca, lest you do that thing unto the Gods, and against yourself. You must not be a teller of tales amongst the children of the Goddess, and you must hold no malice or evil thoughts towards others of the Wicca. You should not lie, nor give false testimony before your Elders, or those who are of the Wicca -- for liars are fools, and a menace unto themselves, and to the Wicca. Be truthful in all your works and deeds, especially within the Circle, for what you say within the presence of the Gods becomes manifest. You must not put stumbling blocks in the way of those who do not follow the Path of the Wicca. You must make no unrighteous judgments of their ways, and you should aid them with an attitude of love when it is asked for. Yet ever should you keep the Counsel of the Elders, and reveal naught to others of where our Circles may be, nor may you reveal our ways without the consent of the Priestess. When you make a vow to the Lord or the Lady, or you swear an oath to another of the Wicca, then you must do all that has come forth from your mouth, for a covenant with the Gods, or with the Wicca, is your Honor, and woe to those who care not for the fetters they attach to their souls by not keeping their word. The Great Mother and Father would not have their children suffer the indignities of oppressors for their sake, for what is within the hearts of Their children is dear and true to Them. The Ancient and Mighty Ones shall cause the balance to be made for those who desecrate the Lord and Lady, Their temples, or Their creations. Never shall you use Magick, nor the Craft, to cause harm, for this is misuse of the Power, and it is not to be condoned. To cause the death of another through the Craft is to require the death of the Self in sacrifice. Never betray any of the brethren, nor the lore of our people, for you are all servants of the Gods, and must live by the virtues of love, honor, and wisdom. Let truth, loyalty, and honor be your creed. Let them be your guides, tempered by love and wisdom. The Order of the Gods shall you keep, and within Their Circles shall you walk. You should not say "I believe" when you doubt, nor claim to obey the Lord and Lady's word when you never enter into the Temple. You must not profess with your lips that which is not in your heart. Do not use the names of the Gods in negative or evil ways, for They love and cherish Their children above all others. All others They love, even those who know them not. Yet those who hate and curse in Their name shall have the Mighty Ones take the measure of their worth. In any disputes between the children of the Goddess, no one may invoke any laws but those of the Craft, or any tribunal but that of Priestess, Priest, and Elders. No one of the Wicca may do anything which will endanger the Craft, nor bring any of the Wicca into conflict with the Law of the Land, or with any of our persecutors. Your magickal tools are channels to that which is most precious and pure within you. Do not cheapen them by haggling their price when you acquire them. Never accept money for the use of the Power. It is sorcerers and charlatans who accept money for their spells and prayers. If you accept no money, you will be free from the temptation to use the Craft for evil or unworthy causes. You shall never take unduly from any human, animal, or elemental that which is not yours to take -- for if you steal from another, in the end you will have to sacrifice something dearer to you in order to attain the balance. Show honor to all people, that they may look up to you, and respect you, and their eyes shall become a mirror for your soul. Those who are of the Wicca shall not own slaves, for one person may not own the spirit of another, for only the Great Mother and Father own our souls. Nor shall you take as a pledge any person's life, for to do so is to take upon yourself both a mill and a millstone. If a stranger sojourns with you, you shall do them no wrong; they shall be as one of the Circle, born amongst ye, and you shall deal with them as you would yourself. Just weights and just balances shall be given by you, and just value shall you give, and thereby receive threefold. Your altars shall be kept clean, pure, and holy, and all that is brought into the Temple or the Circle shall be cleansed and blessed, for the joy of the Gods, and of the Wicca. A clean mind should have a clean body. You should keep your body, your clothes, and your house clean, in honor of the Mother, who gives these things to you. Let none die without honor, without love, without respect, unless their actions have decreed otherwise. You should not couple together if it shall cause pain, jealousy, or deprivation to another by doing so. Union for malice or evil reasons such as these upsets the balance, and the Lords of the Universe shall make adjustments accordingly. Let those who would love, and would be as one, and bear child, be handfasted. For the sharing of love in this manner is beauteous, and love's union in the energy of the Gods, and the heritage of the child. It is important for children to know and to identify with those who brought them here. The Law of the Goddess is that none of the Wicca shall take and wed someone who they do not love, whether it is to harm another, or for some form of material gain. Remember that your children are Goddess-spawned, and are free spirits. You do not own nor control them. They are your brethren, come to visit for a while, that they may share in the vision of your love and wisdom. Let each parent realize that although they may teach and guide with love, the child shall also teach the parent, and aid them in their growth and lesson. The etheric web and energy vortexes of the earth are in constant flux and motion to adjust to the needs of the planet. The sacred trust of the Wicca is to create and to maintain centers of light and knowledge, using the magick of the divine spark within us to focus and channel the forces of the Universal fire. And these are the channels established between the worlds of the stars and the realms of the earth, bringing in and regulating the spirit flames which energize and activate all life forms. Thus we tend and guard the threads of creation, and we weave the patterns of life and manifestation in an ever-evolving tapestry. Never use your heritage or position for self-glorification or gain. Respect your magick and our ways. We must always recognize that while others may look to us to lead them, they too are our guides. Keep your body strong, your mind keen, and your purpose pure, for within your being you shall channel the Power, and it needs to be strong and pure. And these are the keys to the path of Oneness, and to communication with the Gods. Yet first you must learn to speak to Them in such a manner as They can comprehend you. For the children of the Wicca must aid the Gods, and work with Them, otherwise the Gods cannot aid and work with you. Ever remember that the Priest and Priestess are the living representatives of the God and Goddess Forces, and likewise that all humans carry these forces within them, though they may lie dormant and unawakened. As the Great Mother and Father come unto one another and create with the pure vibration of Love-Wisdom, so should you strive to make your Temple pure in vibration, and thus a fitting place wherein you may invite the Gods. Thus, your Circle should always be duly purified and cast, and likewise, those who would use the gateways and travel the Circle between the earth and other realms should also be duly prepared and purified. The Goddess hath said, "I shall not carry thee, yet neither shall I hinder thee, nor keep thee from having the same opportunities as all of my children. Thou art free, yet thou shalt not be coddled like babes in the storm. If thou hast true devotion within thee, then all obstacles may be overcome." The laggard is but half a person -- and though half is better than none, the whole is twice as good as the half. Those who do not work, or who lack the will and desire to learn the ways of the Gods, unto them is said, "The Ancient and Mighty Ones shall not keep thee within their house, if ye learneth not." A sanctuary you shall make unto the Gods, that They may dwell amongst you. And you shall fashion it to the best of your ability, according to all that your Elders shall show you, and pure energy shall you place therein. An altar shall you make unto the Lady, and you shall make due reverence unto Her, for every place where She is exalted, She will come to you and bless you. And you shall fashion your altar out of wood or stone, and burn incense and candles thereon, at the proper times, in observance of her ways. You should set aside at least one day during each moon unto the Goddess, and on these days you shall do Her work; and on those days She shall renew Her children and bless them. Learn to build your own Temple, and to craft your own sacred Circle, and all the tools that are used therein -- for to be a person of the Craft is to be a person of consequence. Let each of you inscribe your own record of our ways and teachings. For the course of each Wiccan should be charted, that the patterns of their life-web may be made known and utilized. Let each Wiccan start their Book of Light with the teachings and lore of their tradition, yet let it also contain the rites and ways of each individual, which are the harvest of each child of the Wicca, to use the wisdom of their heritage as the seeds of their own wisdom. Thus shall our lore and knowledge continue to grow and unfold, like a beautiful flower. It is right to study and to understand the sigils, statues, and stories of the Gods, for they shall guide your thoughts to Them, and They shall hear them. Yet you must ever remember that you worship not the sign nor the statue, but the Gods which inspired them. If your Circle owns any land, let all guard it, and help to keep it clean. Let all justly guard all monies of the Circle, as well as the rights and property of all members of the Circle. If any Wiccan truly labors, then it is right that they should have their just pay. This is not considered the taking of money for the Art, but good and honest work. Yet if any Wiccan works willingly for the good of the Craft, or for their brothers and sisters without pay, then it is to their greatest honor. If any Wiccan should deny themselves some pleasure or material indulgence in order to do service in the Circle, this person shall be blessed and remembered. For those who give for the greater good of all shall have their spirit uplifted. Know also that if you gift the Lady's Priests and Priestesses, or Her Circles, this is an offering made unto the Mother Herself, for a true Priest or Priestess strives always to do Her work, and to be of service to Her children, so to honor and respect them is to honor and respect the Queen of All. And the offerings which are considered the most pleasing to the Gods are these: the fruits of the orchards, the scents of the trees and herbs, the metals of the earth, the waters of the earth, the flowers of the meadows, and the milk of all mothers. Yet offerings of labor or money are honest too, and these will also be accepted -- more so if you work with love in your heart, for always there is work to be done for the Gods, and service to be given to the children of the Wicca. If your offerings are made to restore the balance, it must be of a nature that it not offensive to the Gods. It must be of value, yet given with a free heart. Thus shall the harmony be restored. If your offerings are given with a heart filled with love and devotion, or are of service to the Gods, or to the Craft, then shall you receive blessings manifold. And when you make an offering unto the Gods, you should offer it through the most proper medium, at the proper times, and in such a manner as to make it acceptable. Any and all remains of the rituals shall be consumed in the fire, or buried within the Earth, as a way of returning to the Source all that we use in the observance of our ways, thus ensuring the continuity of the cycle. All may use the Craft to help and aid them, or for the advantage of their Circle, or the Craft -- yet only if you are sure that you harm none. Let each Wiccan and Circle always debate these matters at length. Only if all be satisfied that none be harmed in any way, may the Art then be used. If it is not possible to achieve your ends one way, then perhaps the goal may be achieved by acting in a different way, so as to harm none. Throughout the world it has been many a year since Wiccans have been burned. Yet misuse of the Power might raise the persecutions once again. So never break the Laws, however much you might be tempted, and never consent to their being broken. And if you know they are being broken, then you must work strongly against it. In days of old it was decided by the Mighty Ones who came before us that the Art might be used to restrain others from harming the Craft or its children, yet only after great consultation with all members of the Circle, and only then to deflect or to constrain them. And such were the ways of the Lady that She brought us forth in joy, and such were the Ways of the Lord that His reign gave all life pleasure. Offer love in your worship and all shall be joyous in beauty. In the dimly remembered dawn of ages past, the Wicca were truly free. Then, in Atlantis came the Age of the Misuse of Power, followed by the Ages of Persecution and Suffering. Thus the people of the Wicca hid themselves and cloaked their knowledge, and wove veils of secrecy and silence. And this is how the Ways of the Wicca have been preserved through the time of darkness. Yet much of the ways of our people were lost to the ignorance of others. Yet the cycle spirals ever on -- and the Age of the Earth Mother once again draws nigh. We must be strong -- one with our birthright, and one with our Gods, if we are to bring forth the balance. Those who would harm us, or attempt to enslave us, we must overcome -- yet only through light and love, and never through violence or the evil of chaos. And through our efforts the time of our people will come into being once more. In the times which lie ahead, there lies much work to be done, so that once more the cycles of life are drawn to the path of light, and the balance achieved through the power of love. In order to bring the ways of Light and Love and Life to the peoples of the Earth, our secrets are slowly becoming secrets no more, and it is good that this is so -- for the age of shadow and secrecy is passing. Yet the sharing of our ways needs always to be guided by wisdom and by love. Let our rites and our mysteries be kept sacred. Let no one defile our worship or our heritage. For the defilement of our ways is an honor loss to self, and for the Craft. Let each High Priestess govern her Circle with justice and Love, and with the help and advice of the Elders and the High Priest, always heeding the messages of the Gods when they come. Ever remember that although the Priest is the force with which the Circle is built, the Priestess is the ruler therein -- for it is through her that the Goddess created the world, and all things therein. The High Priestess will heed all complaints of all Pagans and Wiccans, and strive to settle any differences between them with reason and with justice. Let each Circle of Light decide how it shall be known -- whether by earthly name or magickal one. For each child of the Wicca knows best the safety or dangers of their homeland. Let each Circle or Temple maintain and dedicate unto the Goddess and the God all the things that are required for Their rituals, for what is blessed in the name of the Gods rightly belongs to Them, and the Priest and Priestess shall be the caretakers thereof. Anyone of the circle who is of sufficient rank, and wishes to form a new Circle, shall tell the High Priestess and the Elders of their intentions. Members of the old Circle may join the new Circle when it is formed, but if they do so they must leave the other Circle, unless otherwise instructed. For it is the Old Law that each Wiccan may join the Circle of their choice, yet their energy should not be divided between two or more Temples. The Elders of the old and new Circles shall meet in peace and with respect, to decide the level of interaction and connection between the Circles. Yet it is known that the splitting of a Circle often means strife. So only if it is truly in a spirit of peace and harmony should the Circles meet for the celebration of the Great Festivals. None shall enter the Circle that have a sickness or an ailment which may be passed on to the Lady's other children -- for to do so causes harm to yourself, as well as to the others of the Circle. Rather should the Healers go unto the sick one, that through the love of the Gods they shall be made well and whole once more. It has been judged lawful that if any of the Craft need a house, or land, and none will sell, to incline someone's mind so as to be willing to sell, providing it harms none and the full price is paid without haggling. In the matter of quarrels or disputes between the members of the Circle, the High Priestess shall convene the Council, and inquire into the matter. The Council shall hear each person privately, and then both together. And they shall decide justly, not favoring one side nor the other. If an agreeable resolution cannot be reached, then that Wiccan must leave the Circle, for a Circle of Light cannot be properly formed where there is disagreement and discordThe only person whose credentials we were able to verify was Dr. Jay Tibbles. Janette's claims, as given in her various pieces of literature, and as made to us, or to persons whose credentials we were able to verify, include: Hereditary Witch and Druid; Pipe Carrier for the Lumbee, the Sioux, the Cherokee, and the Chumash; member of the MotherGrove and Board of Directors of the ADF, as well as group marriage to the entire ADF Board of Directors; membership and 3rd Circle status in the British Circle of the Universal Bond; training by Ross Nichols, 3rd Degree Celtic and Egyptian Priestess; 3rd Degree Alexandrian Priestess, New York, 1973; 3rd Degree Gardinarian Priestess, New York, 1965; incorporation of her organization in 14 states; training by Rhuddlwm Gawr, and training by Grandmaster Eli (Barney Taylor, of the Druidic Craft of the Wise), marriage to Eli, as well as being both Eli's daughter and granddaughter. She has also claimed to be a registered nurse, a cosmetologist; a paralegal; a professional writer of romance novels, and a Vietnam Veteran. Ms. Copeland claims that she has 10,000 people on her mailing list, groves all over the United States, and that she was born in London during the Blitz, although she has also claimed that she was born in Houston, TX. Ms. Garcia claims that her father, a U.S. Army Major on Eisenhower's staff during WWII, and her mother, a nurse now resident in Atlanta, were both members of the Circle of the Universal Bond. She claims that she was raised by a Cherokee grandfather. She claims to have been teaching Wicca, which she says is a simplified version of Druidism for the masses, since 1954, when she was 12 years old.

Ms. Gordon took Lady Sabrin's course from Our Lady of Enchantment in 1987 and 1988, giving totally different information about herself than she gives now. According to Lady Sabrina, Janette has been selling Sabrina's courses as her own ever since. We have examined lessons from Janette's and Sabrina's courses, and they are indeed substantially identical, except that Sabrina can spell.

Janette joined ADF in 1987, giving yet another set of data about herself, claiming no leadership positions, newsletters, or other affiliations. A check of the material on her application shows it to be substantially false.

In checking Janette's claims, we contacted the Secretary of State and Board of Nursing Registrations in the 14 states in which she claimed incorporation. Her organization is incorporated only in Washington and California. She is not listed as a registered nurse anywhere we checked. She and her group were offering BA's, MA's, and PhD's in Washington State until directed to cease and desist by the Higher Education Coordinating Board. They later obtained a religious exemption by saying that they were offering degrees only in Divinity and Theology. Former members of their organization state that most of their claims in their catalog as to available courses and faculty credentials are false.

In examining their other claims, we contacted over two hundred persons and groups in this country and abroad in an effort to authenticate their initiations and organizational affiliations.

No one we contacted verified any of the DCSG's claims. All stated that they had never trained or initiated any known officers or members of the DCSG. Most had never even heard of them. Further, former members of her organization have mentioned paying thousands of dollars for courses, and additional thousands paid out on "tithes"—10% of their annual income to support the work of the Order of Melchizadek (demanded in the middle of their initiation or elevation rituals). We have also been contacted by Social Services, Education, Law Enforcement, and other authorities for other information about DCSG, and/or its members.

ADF and some other Pagan groups and organizations are cooperating fully with these investigations and have made it clear to the investigators that we do not regard these people as legitimate members of the Pagan community, since none of their alleged training and initiations can be verified, and may have been directly disproven. As Pagans, whatever our path, we can ill-afford to remain silent while groups knowingly steal and sell courses written by others, claiming training ties to the most senior and respected members of our community that they do not have, and engage in questionable behavior presenting themselves as our kin, elders, and representatives to the world at large.Rippling waters flow, cast a stone and the truth you'll know. When you have and hold a need, hearken not to others' greed. With a fool no season spend, nor be counted as his friend. Merry meet and merry part, bright the cheeks and warm the heart. Mind the threefold law ye should, three times bad and three times good. When misfortune is anow, wear the star upon thy brow. True in love you must ever be, lest thy love be false to thee. These eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye Will.

Bright Blessings to all. Here are invocations to the Goddess and God that I have used quite successfully in ritual. They are from the Orphic Hymns, updated for modern applications. Hope you enjoy them.

Invocation to the Goddess:
Divine are Your honors, Oh Mother of the Gods and Nurturer of All. Yoke your swift chariot drawn by bull-slaying lions and, O Mighty Goddess who brings things to pass, join our prayers. Many named and reverend, You are the Queen of the Sky. In the cosmos, Your throne is above all others, for You are Queen of the Earth, and You give gentle nourishment to mortals. Goddesses, Gods, and mortals were born of You, And You hold sway over the rivers and all of the sea.

Invocation to the God:
Hear Our Prayer, O best and Many-Named God. Fine-haired, solitary, and full of lovely song; Many shaped and noble nurturer of all, Maiden and youth in one, unwithering bloom, O Adonis You vanish and grow again in the fair seasons' turn. Kurnunnos, Pan, Myrddhn, two horned Spirit of growth and blooming; Much loved and wept for are you, O Fair and Youthful Hunter of the luxuriant mane. Desire is in Your mind and You come to the Goddess in reverence and respect, in sensuous joy is your desire fulfilled. You are the seed planted in the depths of the Underworld That springs forth, the Green God, that we may sustain our lives. You sacrifice Yourself in gentleness when you are grown. Come Kind-Hearted One, Come Blessed God, and bring much joy to all. Blessed Be.

Hope you find these beneficial. Briget Bless...Phaedra.The High Priestess (HPS) of the Coven will make up the ritual as she goes along, for it was created for the purpose of ego-tripping and wild parties. The worship of the Wicca is beneficial for the owners of Occult Supply Stores, as they love the money of the Wicca.

As a man loves a woman using the missionary position, so the Wicca should frequently deceive their fellows and other total strangers. It is necessary that the Magick Circle, which is the principal difference between a Wiccan rite and a frat party, be cast and all Wicca properly purified to enter it so they can drink five gallons of Ripple each and not throw up.

The HPS shall rule her coven as the local representative of the Goddess and choose whomever she is sleeping with this week to be her High Priest (HP) or her Maiden. Remember that the Wicca would have it that The God Himself kissed her feet and gave up the position of Ringmaster to her because of her arbitrariness and autocracy, her spite and unreason, her mysteriousness and ignorance. So the HP is expected to go as far away as possible and not even show up for Sabbats.

It is the greatest virtue of an HPS that she turns as many of her Covenors into closet Christians as possible, for the true HPS realizes that anyone with the sense Goddess gave a goose is not going to stick around without having a death wish.

In the Olden Days when Wicca extended far, we were free and had reservations in all the best restaurants. But these days, we eat at McDonald's. So be it Ardane, that none but the Wicca shall ever be invited to dinner, for people who ignore us are many, and if they ever found out what we are really up to, they would giggle.

So be it Ardane, that no Coven shall know where the next Coven abides, nor who its members are, save anybody who looks in Circle Newsletter and the hit team we send out to sanction them. So be it Ardane, that no one shall tell anyone anything, least of all thy fellows in the Craft, for fear one of you will learn something; because as it is truly writ: Gerald wrote it, I believe it, that settles it.

And if any break these Laws, they will have to start their own Tradition and make up their own Grandmother. Let each HPS govern her Coven as she damn well pleases, riding rough-shod over the Covenors as long as they will stand for it.

But it must be recognized that sooner or later they will get mad and stop bringing the Ripple to Coven meetings. When this happens, it hath ever been the Old Law that the HPS will Elevate them to the Third Degree and kick them out, and promise them the rest of the Book...someday.

Anyone of any degree or none may found a Coven, provided they think they can get away with it and can create a convincing Grandmother. They may raid other Covens for members as long as no one knows where to find them. But splitting the Coven often means new opportunities for evading the consequences of your actions, so the wise HPS will think of it first.

If you should keep a Black Book, let it be in your own hand of write, except for the parts you xerox out of Lady Sheba. Or better yet, tell everybody they're not of a high enough degree to see it. Proclaim your Wicca-hood loudly and often; you may be able to do a brisk trade in spells, psychic fairs, and talk shows. If nobody believes you, try holding a public skyclad circle. If all else fails, hire a press agent and advertise in the National Inquirer. If they try to make you talk of the Brotherhood, lay it on with a trowel. Ancient Atlantis is always good for a five-minute spot on the six o'clock news. Not all interviewers are bad; some may even flash your business address on the screen for a few seconds.

To avoid discovery, let your working tools be ordinary stuff such as any may have around the house: AR-15's, Patton Tanks, Howitzers (let's see how far we can stretch that First Amendment, gang!). Have no names or signs on anything, and remove the ones they came with, as otherwise this can lead to a charge of receiving stolen property. Let the Pentacles be made of wax unless something else is more convenient. Have no sword, unless you are in the SCA or a collector of WWII memorabilia. Write the names and signs on a gummed label so that it can be peeled off immediately afterward; remember that not guilty by reason of insanity is not a valid defense in cases of this kind.

Ever remember that you are the Hidden Children of the Goddess; when you can take time out from Karma Dumping Runs, Psychic Vendettas, Banishing each other from the Coven, and discussing how much fun it would be to persecute the Christians, remember never to do anything to disgrace Her. Or Them, if that's possible.

In the Olden Days, when we had Power, we could use the Art against any who ill-treated us; but these days a whispering campaign works better. Remember always that there are a lot of flaky people out there, and for this reason, it is best to give a fake name and a Post Office Box address. Someone is always going to blame you for something.

So be it Ardane: Harm none, or at least have a good alibi. Never break this law, or people who get burned along with you will come after you with baseball bats, and you will never be able to score any decent hash again.

Any HPS who does something you don't like you can walk out on, but be sure to clout the Coven Book on the way to the door and set up in business for yourself (Learn Witchcraft From The Experts!). Always accept money for use of the Art, but keep an eye on the Gypsy Laws. In some states, Barter works better. All may use the Art for their own advantage; remember, quick and dirty works best, and you can lay off Karma on the Coven. If that doesn't work, try dead cats in the mailbox.

'Tis the Old Law and most important of all the Laws that no one may do anything that will endanger any of the Craft. Unless there's money in it, or it's to someone you think deserves it, and anyway, "endanger" is in the eye of the beholder. In any dispute between the Wicca, no one may invoke any Law but that of the Craft. However, you can break into your opponent's home and mess up his stuff... after all, it says right here they can't go to the Police.

Never bargain or haggle when you buy by the Art; most Occult Store owners will just throw you out and everyone else will think you're a nut.

It is ever the way with men and with women that they are ruled by their glands. At any moment your HPS may run off and become a Rosicrucian. And the way of Resignation is this: if she doesn't answer her phone for two weeks and is never home when you drive by, you can declare her outcast from the Coven and take it over yourself, with as many as will have you. But if she comes back she will probably take over the Coven again, or start another one in the same building and declare you Invalid, and there's not much you can do about it. Learn to live with anxiety. Get everything in writing.

It hath been found that two people sitting around with a bottle of Chianti discussing Atlantean Grandmothers will become fond of each other, if only because of the Stockholm Syndrome. Therefore, let it be resolved that a human being shall be taught in the Craft only by another human being, and screw the middle-class morality of the nineteen-fifties.

And the Curses of the Mighty Ones be on all who try to take this seriously, or the Craft seriously, or the Wicca seriously. Caveat Lector, and May The Force Be With You!The common man may very well have believed in the literal existence of his many gods and goddesses, but we believe the elite of Egyptian society understood that these neters were purely symbols. When the Egyptian elite paid homage to the neters, they paid homage to the aspects of the universe or of the self represented by those neters. One neter of obvious importance is Set. In dealing with this symbol, we try to identify the original meaning of the symbol and try to eliminate the corruptions of the symbol imposed by the later rule of Osirian religion. Rather than take space here to discuss the corruptions and distortions that were applied to the symbol of the neter Set through the Osirian culture, we'll simply refer the interested student to appropriate books in the reading list: 2A, 2E, 2G, 2W, and 2AA. It is rather clear that the use and peripheral meanings of the neter Set changed over time. The study of Set must therefore include the careful consideration of the source of whatever writings are being studied. Fortunately, most other Egyptian symbols/god forms did not change significantly over time, and such care need not be used in studying and working with them. The neters were used and viewed as symbols. But the Egyptian temples were temples and were recognized as religions, not simply as centers of enlightened philosophy. This brings up the question: Do/did the Egyptian Neters actually exist? Were these religions founded to worship or work with beings that actually existed? Or were they simply the creations of the ancient Egyptian priesthoods? Rather than tackle immediately the question of whether the Neters actually existed, workshop participants first chose to examine...

Egyptian Priesthoods

The first statement made about these priesthoods was that each temple in Egypt taught a different area of philosophy or knowledge. Those temples dedicated to a major neter or god taught that their primal Form was the First Cause. These were the major temples of the land, and an initiate who studied at temple after temple would be presented with the opposing claims that each god was the god, The Creator. We noted in our discussion that the priesthoods of several of the "minor" neters did not make any such claims. Thoth as a single neter never seemed to be treated as the creator god; nor was Geb. However, many of the major neters were treated as creator gods, and many gods were intentionally combined into units (such as Amon-Thoth-Ra) in order to form a god which would be powerful enough to qualify as The creator god.

Neters as Symbols

We returned to discussing the neters as ways of viewing possibility and potentiality, and ways of viewing different aspects of the universe and of the individual. For example, Ra, the sun god, was a most pervasive and powerful being, since every single day, there he is in the sky. Ra was consistent, reliable, and therefore powerful. Similarly, each force in nature was given a personality because each force in nature has a personality (or seems to, to those who humanize such things). This is the basic principle behind most spirits of most animistic religions. These personalities are generally reliable. A rain cloud is going to rain; it isn't going to add to the day's heat. The Nile was not going to dry up -- it was going to overflow once a year and deposit good, rich, fertile earth upon the ground. Each force of nature, each personality, was given a name, a face, and a story. The most powerful stories, faces, and names are those that belong to the creator gods. There are so many creator gods that it's really difficult to pin down an actual order of precedence. This brings up the fact that there are many apparently conflicting stories within Egyptian mythology. The Grand Master pointed out that in several Egyptian myths, Shu and Tefnut are self-created. In others, they were created by tears of the master creator god (whoever he happened to be according to the storyteller). In yet others, they were created by the master god's masturbation. Shu and Tefnut by definition are the first male and female. The master god's masturbation in these latter stories was always male masturbation, but Shu is the first male. Shu and Tefnut begat Geb and Nut, but Nut was the all-pervasive universal sky that preceded the first god... This confusion is the result of centuries of Egyptian storytelling, and while some of it appears to be contradictory, most of it is useful. We certainly must hesitate to consider this mythology as one consistent symbolism and must be careful if we wish to communicate consistent meanings using these symbols, but we have found value in this mythology. Each story is a different way of looking at the world, a different way of looking at the first cause, and of looking at the symbols. By using these symbols, we can then indicate not only a symbol but also which way we are looking at the world. Hence, if in ritual or other communication we call upon Ptah-Geb-Nu, we are calling upon the creator of the earth and sky, the god who created the physical universe. If instead we call upon the Neter Ra-Ptah-ankh, we are calling upon the god who brought light and life to this planet.

Having discussed these differing views of the world as expressed by the many symbolic neters, we felt that this was a good point from which to launch into a discussion of one of the ways in which we look at Neters. Set, the prime source of intelligence and the ageless intelligence himself, is a wee bit complex for someone a mere 20 or even 200 years old to understand, regardless of whether we look at Set as an actually existing being or instead as a master symbol. So rather than try to encompass all of Set, intellectually or emotionally, rather than try to understand all of Set, we can work with neters which are facets of Set's being, facets of Set's symbolism. Each neter can be thought of as a specific element of Set. As examples, Shu is one set of symbolism, one set of ideas, that an initiate can work with to "get somewhere" with, to accomplish certain initiatory goals. Tefnut is another set of ideas, as is Geb, Isis, etc. Rather than trying to encompass and work with the entire universe simultaneously, grab whatever you can hold onto, work with that handful, study that symbol or symbols, and see what it leads to. We had originally intended to discuss whether or not the Neters might or might not exist in their own right. Having discussed the above, it seemed somewhat unimportant as to whether the Neters actually exist. That topic will be left for a later discussion.

MONAD MODEL

In conjunction with the Cosmic Planes and Elements Model, Enochian Physics proposes the Enochian Monad Model. These two models are not meant to be independent, rather they are inclusive and are only separated for convenience.

A monad is defined as an indivisible unit (Hadit), but is used in the sense that a monad is the infinitely small conscious point of every entity. The only difference between monads is experience. Giordano Bruno taught that the monad was the ultimate spiritual particle and that all entities had a monad at their center, the core of their being. Every monad is monastic above the first Aethyr (LIL), and is dualistic below. This duality takes many forms as the monad manifests itself downward. Basically, it consists of a subjective self in the center of an objective world. Figure 2 shows a pictorial representation of this model.

ENOCHIAN AXIOMS

1. Man, and every entity (thing) in existence, is in his (its) essence a monad. This monadic essence expresses itself as a subjective 'I' and an objective 'NOT-I'.
2. A monad's geometric equivalent is the sphere. The center is the 'I'. The surface of the sphere is the 'NOT-I'.
3. The 'I' is conscious individuality.
4. The 'NOT-I' is the world in which the 'I' finds itself at any given point in time and space.
5. Every geometric point in space is an 'I-NOT-I' monad in some stage of self-expression.
6. Any 'I' can communicate with any other 'I' only insofar as their 'NOT-I's' intersect.
7. A world is defined as a set of intersections of a host of 'NOT-I's' at any given point in time and space.
8. Subsets of 'I's' are mutually exclusive.
9. Subsets of 'NOT-I's' may be either exclusive or inclusive.
10. The monadic essence of each monad allows multitudinous expression, but no 'I' can ever separate itself from or exist independently of its 'NOT-I'.

THEOREMS OF ENOCHIAN PHYSICS

1. Every person is an 'I-NOT-I' monad.
2. Every point in space is a consciousness center.
3. Energy flows from one cosmic plane or sub-plane to an adjacent cosmic plane or sub-plane through Laya centers, dimensionless points of space which serve as channels for the flow of energies and forces.
4. Spirit is unmanifested energy. Matter is manifested energy.
5. Every manifestation within space and time is dualistic.
6. Space, time, and consciousness come into existence simultaneously.
7. Every energy field and every force in our universe is directed by the True Will.

THE FORCES OF MAGICK

There are six Magickal forces that are manifested in existence. These six forces, by necessity, manifest in dual triads, the upper, and the lower.

THE UPPER TRIAD

1. Divine Force. This is said to be the "Supreme Force" relative to our universe. This so-called 'Supreme Force' is known as 'The TRUE WILL'. It is the 'Divine' driving force of Hadit.
2. Creative Force. The Kundalini of Eastern thought, manifesting below the Abyss, as electromagnetic energy.
3. Thought Force. This is the occult force that often takes the form of projection, and continually projects fundamental subjective ideas of the 'I' outward into the 'NOT-I'.

THE LOWER TRIAD

1. Mind Force. This force should properly be called 'Intellectual', and would be attributed to Mercury. This is the reasoning and logical powers of the intelligent entity. This force also includes all of the senses.
2. Will Force. This is the lower manifestation of the 'Divine Force'. This force is what drives us in a physical sense, it is our outer needs and desires. It is what most 'men' perceive as their 'will', however, it is frequently the opposite side of the 'Will Duality'.
3. Word Force. Words and Letters, speech and physical action make up this aspect of the magickal forces. It is the power of sound, which has long been known in the west. God is said to create by uttering His Word. Consider this; some politicians are virtual masters of this magickal force.

As can be seen there is little real difference between the Enochian view of man and that of the Thelemic Magician, with the main differences being that of nomenclature. It can also be seen that the six 'magical forces' generally correspond to the five divisions of man as set forth by Crowley, with the exception of the sixth 'force'. This extra point is comprised of the actions performed by the first five. If we think of man as a hexagram, instead of a pentagram, we have the four elements, spirit, and motion.

The elements and spirit make up the essential man, but he is still static. With the addition of the sixth, he becomes dynamic, capable of experience. It is then this 'man' that has the 'essences of man', for until he becomes dynamic by virtue of his motion, and gains in experience, he is incapable of attainment.

As was stated above, Man's aspiration is to a higher place in the hierarchy of the universe. Here then are the Laws of Hierarchies, they will show, though perhaps not directly, how this ascension (attainment) is made possible.

HIERARCHIES

Law of Hierarchies. From the highest realms of spirit to the lowest levels of matter, everything in between is composed of a host of gods, monads, or life atoms arranged in a myriad of hierarchies.

The following rules apply:

1. All aggregates are composed of hierarchies. All things, save Hadit, are aggregates. We see in our world complete structures, which are composed of molecules, atoms, and sub-atomic particles in one direction. And planets, solar systems, and galaxies in another. Thus science has enabled us to see, on a mundane level, that our physical universe is composed of some basic hierarchies. Though from rules 3 and 4 we see that these hierarchies continue unto infinity.
2. For every hierarchy, there is a governing ruler or hierarch. On our personal level, we have that which is referred to as our Holy Guardian Angel. As we descend to the atomic level, we have the nucleus of the atom. Each component of that atom has, in turn, its own hierarch. In our worldly governments, we see examples of these hierarchs; mayors, governors, presidents, etc. And we can begin to see our place in the physical manifestation of these hierarchies. We are also members of hierarchies on less physical, or spiritual levels, though little is known of these.
3. Hierarchies descend infinitely into matter. Again, from our 'middle world, we see the manifestation of yet smaller structures or hierarchies, which descend to the smallest particles which science is able to see or theorize.
4. Hierarchies ascend infinitely into spirit. On these levels, little is known, science has or can not enter into the realm of spirit. We do know, however, that our own personal hierarch is our H.G.A., and that logically we are but a component part of some yet higher structure or hierarchy.
5. The universe has a hierarchical structure, interlinking groups of entities living and working together. If we look sky-ward we can begin to see something of this structure on a physical level. Our stellar universe is made up of planets, solar systems, stellar clusters, galaxies, and on and on. While earth is not yet working with other groups of entities on a stellar level (as far as we are allowed to know), it is clear that we must share the same stellar environment with others. We can, however, observe this 'working together' here on planet earth. We can see the governments of cities, counties, states, and countries working toward what is perceived as the common good (at least in most cases).
6. Hierarchies are born, evolve, and die. The best example of this, I think, is ourselves. We are born into this world, grow and experience (evolve) over some period of time then die, this is all a part of what we call 'life'. Other examples of this rule may be seen in various extinct forms of animal life, which came into existence, evolved over time, then died out. We can also see examples on the stellar level, stars which are born from collections of gases, grow and evolve into fiery furnaces, then die out.
7. Worlds are created by hierarchies of cosmic builders and architects acting together.
8. Every world contains hierarchies of recorders who constitute the forces of karmic history.
9. The cosmic elements and planes are composed of countless hosts of evolving hierarchies.
10. Every hierarchy is composed of a host of smaller hierarchies.
11. Every hierarchy is a component part of a larger hierarchy.

Thus we have the Enochian view on the nature, place, and path of Man. To better understand this mystery of the true meaning of A.`. A.'. and this nature of man we may now look at some of the Temurahs of the number 451.

These are; 451, 415, 541, 514, 145, and 154. We shall start with the least of these.

The number 145; In Sepher Sephiroth it is defined as the numerical value of the 13 paths of the Beard of Microprosopus.

The number 154; Again from Sepher Sephiroth; it is 'Elohim of Loves', and we are referred to the number 149. The reference in 149 is to 'The living GODS'.

In these two numbers we have references to Man and this 'Starry' nature. Though in the number 149 it is perhaps more direct. 'The living GODS', indeed, the most tangible link between man and GOD is this 'Starry' essence. Both Man and ANY GOD that one cares to think of are at the core one and the same, that is to say, that we are all made of the same stuff, we are all MONADS at some level of evolution. But, on we go.

The number 415; Still again from Sepher Sephiroth. The number is that of the Voice of the Chief Seer and also 'The Holy One'.

Still again subtle references to this 'Star' nature which we have already examined.

The number 514 and 541. Here are references that are a bit more obscure. 514 gives reference to 'KABBALA DENUDATA', a reference that unfortunately I will have to pass on due to a misfortune beyond my control. The number 541 refers to 'Israel', which at first may seem strange, but, historically Israel is/are 'Gods' chosen people. We may take this to mean 'Free Man' in the Thelemic sense. The number is thus indicating Man, or rather those Men that have risen above the slavery of the old aeon and have begun to ascend/aspire to Yetzirah. Those Men who have realized some small part of their true essence.

So then! Just what the hell is the true meaning of the initials A.`. A.'. and the number 451? It is no more and surely no less than the MONAD! Though others may use different words and different systems to explain this, their meaning will of necessity be the same.From the moment that two cells form a zygote, we see the interaction of informational processes: recognition, communication, interaction, integration, re-stabilization, and reproduction or re-structurization. This cycle of life can be seen from the barest combinations of any two elemental components beginning at the lowest atomic designations of energy and throughout the continuum of increasing complexity, perhaps far beyond our capabilities to understand.

If consciousness can be defined as an awareness of integrity through this process of self-recognition, then consciousness can be easily applied to that which is non-human. From the most basic interactions of chemistry, we find that even on an atomic level there is this type of consciousness. We have become aware of the atom's necessary maintenance of its own structure through the evidence of necessary balancing of protons, neutrons, and electrons; the importance of electron shell valences is also a reminder of this type of integrity. Even on an atomic level, there is a form of awareness of self-integrity in order to maintain structure and identity.

This process of awareness is also a genius of discrimination, a form of identification of self and non-self on an energetic level. There is a borrowing, and sometimes a sharing energetically, yet when this process of self-recognition begins to fail, we see the destruction of the matter it involves. This is evident with atomic structure and also evident at the human level in the study of cancer. Therefore, we might look at this process of self-recognition and maintenance and examine its nature in order to find its function and capabilities.Renaissance: Usually considered as beginning in Italy in the 14th century, this period marked the transition from the Middle Ages to the modern world. It is characterized by classical scholarship, scientific and geographical discovery, and the exploration of individual human potential.

Civil War: 1640-1649, between the Royalists under Charles I and the Parliamentarians led by Oliver Cromwell. Charles I was executed in 1649.

Crusades: A series of wars undertaken by the Christians of western Europe with the authorization of the Papacy from 1095 until the mid-15th century for the purpose of recovering the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem from the Muslims and defending possession of it.

Thirty Years' War: A major conflict involving Austria, Denmark, France, Holland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden that devastated central Europe, especially Germany. It began as a war between Protestants and Catholics but developed into a general power struggle (1618-1648).

Lateran Councils: Five ecumenical councils held at the Lateran Palace (the official residence of the Pope) between 1123 AD and 1512 AD.

PERSECUTION: ANCIENT AND MODERN

Appendix C - Gnostic and Christian sects

Manichaeism: A dualistic Gnostic religion first preached by Mani in the 3rd century AD. Its early center was Babylonia, then part of the Persian empire and a meeting place of faiths. The basic theology of Manichaeism is that good and evil are separate and opposed principles, which have become mixed in the world through the action of the evil principle. There is a complicated mythology that describes the creation of the world and the elements, and a set of complex correspondences by which the seeker can return to a state of salvation. Manichaeism spread across a huge area, including the Roman Empire. However, by the 6th century, it had virtually been eradicated from Spain, France, and Italy, although it was strong in the eastern Mediterranean until the 9th century, when it was absorbed into the neo-Manichean sects of the Bogomils, Cathars, etc.

Bogomils: A religious sect that flourished in the Balkans between the 10th and 15th centuries. Their central teaching was strictly dualistic; that the visible, material world was created by the Devil, and that everything within it was therefore evil. They rejected many of the trappings of Christianity, and their condemnation of anything to do with the flesh - including eating and drinking - has rightly earned them the nickname, "the greatest puritans of the middle ages."

Cathars: A heretical Christian sect that flourished in western Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries. They believed that goodness existed only in the spiritual world created by God, and that the material world, created by Satan, was evil. Their theology bore a great resemblance to that of Manichaeism and the Bogomils, and they were closely connected with the latter.

Waldensians: Also known as Valdenses or Vaudois. The sect was founded in southern France in the 12th century and emphasized poverty, abstinence from physical labor, and a life devoted to prayer. They were influenced by other "heretical" sects and rejected a number of the basic tenets of the Catholic faith. They were stern opponents of the acquisition of wealth and power within the Church and thus came into direct opposition to the Papacy, which thrived on both. They were fiercely persecuted, and by the end of the 15th century, confined mainly to the French and Italian valleys of the Cottian Alps. During the 16th century, the Waldensians were transformed into a Protestant church but suffered heavy persecution throughout the 17th century from the Dukes of Savoy. This ceased only after Oliver Cromwell intervened personally on their behalf with the duke, Charles Emmanuel II. In the latter part of the 17th century, the Waldensians returned to their original homeland, and in 1848 the Waldensians were given civil rights and are today members of the World Presbyterian Alliance.**MAGICK 7 -- BASIC RITUAL**

'The first part of every ceremony is the banishing; the second the invoking.' (Crowley, Magick, p. 104)

Ritual is the heart of magick. Through ritual, we achieve our magical results. Ritual is a procedure or ceremony performed to change the environment. It often affects the physical world, though outsiders may attribute the changes to coincidence. Magical goals for a ritual should be taken seriously.

The successful practice of magick depends on strong belief. The simplest ritual is belief itself. If you believe in your desired results strongly enough, that act is a magical ritual. Even a complex ritual is no more effective than strong belief. Aids to concentration, such as creative visualization, imagination, and controlled breathing, can help.

**CREATIVE VISUALIZATION**

When you want to achieve something magically, first picture it clearly in your mind. The more definite and specific your idea, the better. Visualize yourself having or doing it. Concentrate on it intensely, feeling the energy of desire welling up inside you. Then, suddenly release the image from your mind, imagining the energy exploding out into the universe. Finally, believe that your purpose has been accomplished, perhaps saying something like "so mote it be" or "it is done."

**THE BASIC PARTS OF A RITUAL**

A full magick ritual must always reduce to these stages: 1) imaging; 2) building; 3) firing. Sometimes a ritual must be repeated daily to achieve difficult results or to overcome weak belief.

**THE MAGICK CIRCLE**

An important part of formal ritual is the magick circle. Medieval magicians considered the circle essential and placed great emphasis on its exactness. The circle is made on the floor with chalk, paint, rock salt, or a rope. It is important for magical protection and focusing the energy of the ritual. The circle may eventually be supplemented with electronic equipment for a similar purpose.

**ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS**

An artificial elemental is useful for tasks like watching, guarding, healing, and more. It is a thoughtform strengthened with emotion. Communicate with your elemental through telepathy, talking, or visualization. It is closely linked to your subconscious attitudes and will generally not do things you think it cannot do.

**INVOCATION**

Formal ritual usually involves the invocation of a god, goddess, spirit, or other entity. Magick ritual is a technique, not a religion. Invocation can create an artificial elemental. Crowley describes three kinds of invocation: 1) Devotion to the entity; 2) Ceremonial invocation; 3) Drama.

**CAUTIONS**

1. Balance is important in magick. Vary the entities invoked to keep your personality in balance.
2. Rituals may produce side effects, usually similar to the desired goal. If the true goal is delayed, side effects may appear first.
3. Magick follows the 'law of results,' requiring effort. Difficult goals have greater resistance. If a ritual doesn't produce the desired results, the reason may be within ourselves. Ensure there is no contradiction between your model and your magical goals.
4. Results of a ritual are not usually instantaneous. There is often a delay. Sometimes the effects appear to extend to before the ritual was performed.
5. A ritual may create an emphasis on what is sought and a de-emphasis on everything else. Balance is important. Once the magical result is achieved, it may be difficult to get rid of. Consider your magical goals wisely.
6. The environment may react against the magick after the results are achieved. This is noticeable in weather magick. The weather may react to re-establish its natural balance.
7. Magick ritual is dangerous for the mentally unstable. If you 'get out too far,' use your religious background or old belief system for support. Weird experiences are not necessarily bad experiences.

Since their early days of undiluted Alexandrianism, they have drifted somewhat towards a more Gardnerian approach. Today, they tell everyone that there are no differences between the two traditions. In fact, despite the merging that has been occurring over the last few years, there are very distinct differences between the traditions; some merely external, others of a very significant difference of philosophy.

Seldiy Bate was originally magically trained by Madeline Montalban and then took an Alexandrian initiation from Maxine and Alex. Her husband, Nigel, was also initiated by Maxine, and they have been public witches for a number of years now, often appearing on TV, radio, and in the press. Their background in ritual magic is expressed in the type of coven that they run; a combination of Wicca and Ceremonial Magic.

In 1971, Alex and Maxine went their separate ways. David Goddard is a Liberal Catholic Priest, and for many years, he and Maxine worked in the Liberal Catholic faith and did not run a coven of any kind. Then in 1984, Maxine gathered together a group again and started practicing a combination of Wicca, Qabalah, and Liberal Catholicism. She and David separated in 1987, and since then her coven has been exclusively Wiccan. In 1989, she married one of her initiates, Vincent, and they are still running an active coven in London today.

Alex's history after the split was a little more sordid, with one girl he married, Jill, filling the gutter press with stories about Alex being homosexual and defrauding her of all her money to spend on his boyfriends. Sally Taylor was initiated by Maxine and David, but then transferred to Alex. She was trained by him and then started her own group.

I'd now like to focus upon the last of the strands which I believe has been influential upon the birth and development of Wicca; that of the literary traditions and sources to which Gardner would have had access. To a certain extent, these are contiguous with the magical traditions described earlier, as nowhere is it ever suggested that Gardner did in fact ever work in a magical Lodge, so we must assume that his knowledge came from the written form of the rites, not from the actual practice of them.

From reading Gardner's books, it is quite apparent that Margaret Murray had a tremendous impact upon him. Her book, "The God of the Witches" was published in 1933, and twelve years previously, "The Witch Cult in Western Europe" had appeared. "The God of the Witches" has been tremendously influential on a number of people, and certainly inspired Gardner.

In fact, "Witchcraft Today," published by Gardner in 1954, contained a foreword by Margaret Murray. At this time, remember, Murray's work was still taken seriously, and she remained the contributor on the subject of witchcraft for the Encyclopedia Britannica for a number of years.

Now, of course, her work has been largely discredited, although she remains a source of inspiration, if not historical accuracy. In Gardner's day, the idea of a continuing worship of the old pagan gods would have been a staggering theory, and in the second article in my series about Murray (published in The Cauldron), I made the point that Murray may have had to pretend scientific veracity in order to get her work published in such times. Don't forget that Dion Fortune had to publish her work privately, as did Gardner with High Magic's Aid.

Carlo Ginzburg's excellent book, "Ecstasies," also supports Murray's basic premise; although of course he regrets her historical deceptions.

There were of course other sources than Murray. In 1899, "Aradia: Gospel of the Witches" was published. Most of Crowley's work was available during the pre- and post-war years, as were the texts written and translated by MacGregor Mathers and Waite. Also readily available were works such as The Magus, and of course the classics, from which Gardner drew much inspiration.

Of paramount importance would have been "The White Goddess," by Robert Graves, which is still a standard reference book on any British Wiccan's bookshelf. This was published in 1952; three years after High Magic's Aid appeared, and two years before Gardner's first non-fictional book about witchcraft. I would just like to say at this point that Graves has taken some very unfair criticism in respect of this book. The White Goddess was written as a work of poetry, not history, and to criticize it for being historically inaccurate is to miss the point. Unfortunately, I agree that some writers have referred to it as an "authority," and thus led their readers up the garden path. This is not Graves's fault, nor do I believe it was his intention.

Another book which has had a profound influence on many Wiccans, and would undoubtedly have been well known by Gardner is "The Golden Bough"; although the entire book was written based upon purely secondary research, it is an extensive examination of many pagan practices from the Ancient World, and the emphasis of the male sacrifice could certainly have been taken from here equally as well as from Murray. Certain of the Gardnerian ritual practices were almost certainly derived from The Golden Bough, or from Frazer's own sources.

In "Witchcraft Today" Gardner mentions a number of authors when speculating where the Wiccan rites came from. He says that, "The only man I can think of who could have invented the rites was the late Aleister Crowley."

He continues to say, "The only other man I can think of who could have done it is Kipling...". He also mentions that, "Hargrave Jennings might have had a hand in them..." and then suggests that "Barrat (sic) of The Magus, circa 1800, would have had the ability to invent or resurrect the cult."

It's possible that these references are something of a damage control operation by Gardner, who, according to Doreen, was not too impressed when she kept telling him that she recognized certain passages in the Witch rites! "Witchcraft Today" was published the year after Doreen's initiation, and perhaps by seeming genuinely interested in where the Rites came from, Gardner thought he might give the appearance of innocence of their construction!

As mentioned previously, Gardner also had a large collection of unpublished MSS, which he used extensively, and one has only to read his books to realize that he was a very well-read man, with wide-ranging interests. Exactly the sort of man who would be able to draw together a set of rituals if required.

The extensive bibliography to "The Meaning of Witchcraft" published in 1959, demonstrates this rather well. Gardner includes Magick in Theory and Practice and The Equinox of the Gods by Crowley; The Mystical Qabalah by Dion Fortune; The Goetia; The White Goddess (Graves); Lady Charlotte Guest's translation of The Mabinogion; English Folklore by Christina Hole; The Kabbalah Unveiled and the Abramelin by Mathers; both Margaret Murray's books and Godfrey Leland's Gypsy Sorcery, as well as a myriad of classic texts, from Plato to Bede!

Although this bibliography postdates the creation of Gardnerian Wicca, it certainly indicates from where Gardner draws his inspiration from. There are also several books listed which are either directly, or indirectly, concerned with sex magic, Priapic Cults, or Tantra.

Hargrave Jenning, mentioned earlier, wrote a book called "The Rosicrucians, their Rites and Mysteries," which Francis King describes as a book, "concerned almost exclusively with phallicism and phallic images - Jennings saw the penis everywhere."

As I mentioned earlier, Hargrave Jennings, a member of the SRIA, also belonged to a group, described as a coven, which met in the Cambridge area in the 1870s, and performed rituals based upon the classical traditions - specifically, from The Golden Ass. There is no evidence to support this, except that there are often found references to a "Cambridge Coven" linked to Jennings' name. Many of the rituals we are familiar with today were of course later additions by Doreen Valiente, and these have been well documented by both her and the Farrars, in a number of books. Doreen admits that she deliberately cut much of the poetry by Aleister Crowley, and substituted either her own work, or poems from other sources, such as the Carmina Gadelica.

Of course, we can never really know the truth about the origins of the Wicca. Gardner may have been an utter fraud; he may have actually received a "Traditional" initiation; or, as a number of people have suggested, he may have created the Wicca as a result of a genuine religious experience, drawing upon his extensive literary and magical knowledge to create, or help create, the rites and philosophy.

What I think we can be fairly certain about is that he was sincere in his belief. If there had been no more to the whole thing than an old man's fantasy, then the Wicca would not have grown to be the force that it is today, and we would not all be sitting here in Canberra on a Saturday morning!Indeed, they may go the same way as the unicorns and their honey pots. Between Christopher Robin and Pooh, they have achieved sufficient development to leave their current plane and move on to higher things. Christopher Robin, as can be seen from his name, Christ/Robin, is a Tipherathic aspect of Pooh; the center where the lower and higher self come together. When they have united, the way is open and clear for them to move on to the next sphere of existence.

Thus, it should be every witch's ambition to be reincarnated as a bear of very little brain who lives in the hundred-acre wood on a plane at least one above this one. After all, the idiots we see running this world have to be seen as a damn sight more stupid than even Wol. (PS Mrs. Thatcher is also a Libran!)

The End.From the moment that two cells form a zygote, we see the interaction of informational processes: recognition, communication, interaction, integration, re-stabilization, and reproduction or restructuring. This cycle of life can be seen from the simplest combinations of any two elemental components, beginning at the lowest atomic designations of energy and throughout the continuum of increasing complexity—perhaps far beyond our capabilities to understand.

If consciousness can be defined as an awareness of integrity through this process of self-recognition, then consciousness can be easily applied to that which is non-human. From the most basic interactions of chemistry, we find that even on an atomic level, there is a form of consciousness. We have become aware of the atom's necessary maintenance of its own structure through the evidence of necessary balancing of protons, neutrons, and electrons; the importance of electron shell valences is also a reminder of this type of integrity. Even on an atomic level, there is a form of awareness of self-integrity in order to maintain structure and identity.

This process of awareness is also a genius of discrimination—a form of identification of self and non-self on an energetic level. There is a borrowing, and sometimes a sharing energetically, yet when this process of self-recognition begins to fail, we see the destruction of the matter it involves. This is evident with atomic structure and also evident at the human level in the study of cancer. Therefore, we might look at this process of self-recognition and maintenance and examine its nature in order to find its function and capabilities.

When we look at different types of matter, we find that the simpler the atomic structure of the mass, the less complex its process of consciousness needs to be. Things that are comprised of only one atomic component do not need complex processes of communication between those components. Thus, the level of consciousness is rather low on an evolutionary scale of creativity, yet we also see that these types of things are far more stable in regards to their integrity—far less vulnerable to destruction. For example, it takes an enormously concentrated force of heat to break the integrity of an atom, yet a mere 2000-degree flame will not only destroy the integrity of human consciousness but also destroy the integrity of the individual component molecules which form the material mass of a human to their lowest forms as individual atoms.

When we look at the forces involved in the communication of energy, we see a flowing medium of different frequencies within a single spectrum of energetic potential. Elemental energies and forces—light, sound, temperature, pressure, magnetism, electricity—differentiate and vary in intensity and frequency yet are very alike in that they are all means of transferring energy as a form of communication which can be informative/stabilizing or disinformative/destructive, depending on the structure of the consciousness they encounter. It may be perceived that the more complex the structure, the lower the frequency of the integrity of that structure and the more vulnerable that structure is to disinformation.

The more diverse the components that are included within a thing, and the more efficient the means of communication within the structure of that thing, the lower the common denominator of frequency of integrity must be in order that the informational frequency will not be destructive to any of the component parts. To analyze this statement, we must look at other analogies within our environment. Firstly, I would like to examine the nature of sound.

Sound waves come in varying frequencies and modulations, and as humans, we assign different notes to those steps within the frequency spectrum which we can differentiate and perceive. If we play several notes simultaneously, we find that in order to maintain a balance harmonically, we must play notes that match each other's modulation. You can play a "C" note at any octave and, in fact, play all "C" notes simultaneously, and you will find that within the frequency range, these notes will complement each other; in fact, they will contribute/share energy with each other. We find similar matching if we look at musical chording. If you play the notes "F" and "C," the sharing of energy vibrationally between those two ranges of frequency will, in fact, create the note of "A" in the range in which the two notes' frequencies overlap. In this way, communication is informative and, in fact, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Similarly, playing two notes which lie in the same modulation frequencies simultaneously will increase the duration of the vibration compared to the duration if each note were played alone.

When we examine the sharing of electrical information at an atomic level, we see that through the temporary sharing of electrons in a phase path also indicates something that we might consider as investing a thing (atom) with more than the sum of its parts. Similarly, in using electric frequencies in a series, we store information on silicon chips which invest them with more than they would be if one simply looked at the electrical and silicon components alone. This transference of energy is also a transference of information in frequencies which in many ways we are still attempting to understand.

Simple, one-component things can sustain far higher frequencies of energetic transmission than can complex components of things. Frequencies that pass freely through atoms ultimately destroy complex things such as humans when they are subject to them. It appears that the more complex the union of the components, the slower and more tediously complex the transformation of data must be. The more complex a thing is, the lower the vibrational capability it sustains in order to maintain the integrity of its own structure.

Energetic communication exists infinitely throughout the universe. The transference of information through radio waves and light waves continues back in time to the occasion of what was known as the Big Bang. It may be that in the future we will find that in the same way gravity and electromagnetism are also continuums of information from times long past. Scientifically, we study these energetic continuums and yet we doubt and deny the holistic communicative nature of the universe. We search for causes and effects within the realms of our limited perceptions and are amazed when we can find no causal effects to explain change.

When we examine biological life, we find that each evolutionary adaptation seems to be an extension of the process of self/non-self awareness and maintenance of integrity. Not only do we see intensification of sensory perceptual abilities, but also we note that the integrational and responsive/reactive components of the process also have to evolve and adapt in order to stay integrated with the rest of the consciousness. Amoebas are simple life forms, and yet we can examine them and see that each organic component within that life form serves as an informational and communicative component within the process of maintaining the integrity (life) of the whole. When this communication process or any part of it ceases, the organization of the organism begins to deteriorate and eventually ceases and dies. In biological life, we find that though we have maintained the use of electronic communication on some neural levels, we have sunk to the depths of transferring actual molecular compounds (proteins, amino acids) in most of our organic processes. Even the human brain, supposed highest achievement of organic life forms, requires base molecular salts in order to process electrical information. Our complexity denies us the speed of light, radio, and other faster and higher frequency modes of communication except from outside of ourselves.

The human consciousness is a genius of discrimination. We use the abilities of discrimination to identify those stimuli which come from outside of our biological forms in order to protect and maintain our integrity (life). We use our senses (inefficient though they may be) to gather and interpret pure energetic communications such as the radiated energy of sunlight, and we are so inefficient at interpreting that data that we can only sense light and heat, and it destroys those sensors that gather that information through blindness and sunburn if we continue too long in our attempts. Yet, conversely, we need the information from sunlight which stimulates our organic forms into producing vitamin D (without which we would die). Is this a remnant of photosynthetic capabilities from less complex integrations, or merely a new attempt at further increasing our potential?

As organic forms of consciousness, we are sorely limited in our perceptions of the universe. Limited in exploring the possibly limitless ranges of energetic exchange simply due to the limits placed upon communication due to the complexity of our component structure. Yet rather than admit to our limitations, we seek further exploration through the development of tools made from things less complex than ourselves. In the laboratory, we use light waves and shaped silicon to create microscopes to increase our sense of visual acuity within the spectrum of visible radiation imaging. In the studio, we use simple cones, flattened vegetable matter, and electronic amplification to create tools to compensate for our limited aural perception. We have created many tools out of simpler and less complex components in order to reach those higher frequencies of information which are either so far removed from us as to be imperceptible, or so destructive to us that we dare not experience them ourselves.

The human zygote from the moment of conception is a discriminating consciousness.8. You will destroy no one in any way—through gossip, killing their gifts, or discouraging self-love by injuring the physical body with foreign substances, incorrect foods, or incorrect labor.

The ritual involves various roles, including the High Priestess (HPS), the High Priest (HP), and other participants. The temple is set up with specific items like a cauldron, candles, and a pomegranate. The ritual includes casting a circle, invoking the quarters, and calling upon the Lord and Lady. The HPS reads a declamation, and the group participates in various symbolic actions, such as dancing and planting seeds. The Horned God and the Goddess play significant roles, with the Horned God leading a dance and the Goddess joining him behind a veil. The ritual concludes with a period of meditation, consecration of seeds, and a symbolic closing of the veil between the worlds. The document also includes references to other rituals and discussions about the legitimacy and practices within the Craft.In the process of developing complexity, the fetus learns to interpret communicative energies from the outer world to define itself, its integrity, and its maintenance of self apart from the influence of "other." Cells join together in communication to form cooperative systems, each with separate responsibilities to the whole. Organs with specific functions support the organism in its fight to maintain its integrity. Consciousness of mind determines the difference between self and non-self, regulating the integrity of the whole. This harmony of components within a symphony of orchestration is the essence of being alive.

Despite our complexities and recognition of our vulnerabilities and limitations, humans are beings of arrogant mind. We claim supremacy over all biological organisms and the sole right to conscious thought, as if we were the only form of communication we wished to recognize. We deny our insecurities and lay claims to great understandings concerning the universe, even though we do not fully understand the workings of our own process of integration and communication within our biological forms. We claim ownership of consciousness, yet we do not truly evaluate the process of consciousness or its beginnings.

Despite our inadequacies, we assume to know the nature of the beginnings of all life. We claim to know the "mind" of "God," the prime causation for all that exists, and we claim superiority in emulation of this "God" above and beyond all other forms of life or integrity. We seek security in the midst of our fear, inadequacies, and vulnerabilities by developing a belief system that guarantees our security in a place beyond our perception. We seek safety and foundation while reaching outward to claim flight amongst the stars.

This is the paradox of humanity, of mind. Complexity found in simplicity, using simplicity to explore a universe beyond the range of our complex integrity. Our complex integrity is vulnerable to all but the simplest energies, while we use complex energies that would destroy us to prove our strength. What we look for, we eventually find at the expense of closing our senses to see what really is. Perhaps it is true that the most foolish are those who claim knowledge, for they have closed their minds to further learning, and the most wise are those who claim knowledge of nothing, that they may learn all.The document discusses the complexities and misconceptions surrounding Neopaganism and Wicca, particularly focusing on the historical and ideological influences of figures like Gardner and Crowley. It critiques the modern interpretations and practices within Neopaganism, highlighting the divergence from ancient pagan practices and the potential pitfalls of feminist reinterpretations. The text also delves into the discovery and significance of the "Book of Shadows" and other related manuscripts, exploring their authenticity and historical context. Additionally, it touches on the broader implications of these findings for the understanding and practice of modern Wicca and its relationship with Thelemic and Gnostic traditions. The narrative includes personal anecdotes and reflections on the author's experiences and research, providing a nuanced perspective on the evolution and current state of Neopaganism.The adjustment of the relationship between the selves in an organism. The basis difference between a magician and a civilian is that the latter's octarine power is vestigial or undeveloped. The normal resting or neutral mode of a civilian corresponds to a mild expression of the yellow power, which he regards as his normal personality or "ego." The magician self, however, is fully aware that this is but one of eight major tools that the organism possesses. Thus, in a sense, the "normal personality" of the magician is a tool of his magical self (and, importantly, vice versa). This realization gives him some advantage over ordinary people. However, the developing magical self will soon realize that it is not in itself superior to the other selves that the organism consists of, for there are many things they can do which it cannot.

The development of the octarine power through the philosophy and practice of magic tends to provide the magician with a second major center amongst the selves to complement the ego of the yellow power. The awakening of the octarine power is sometimes known as "being bitten by the serpent." Those who have been are usually as instantly recognizable to each other as, for example, two lifeboat survivors are.

Perhaps one of the greatest tricks of sleight of mind is to allow the magician self and the ego to dance together within the psyche without undue conflict. The magician who is unable to disguise himself as an ordinary person, or who is unable to act independently of his own ego, is no magician at all. Nevertheless, the growth of the octarine, or eighth power of the self, and the discovery of the type of magician one wants to be, and the identification or synthesis of a god form to represent it, tend to create something of a mutant being, who has advanced into a paradigm that few others are aware of. It is not easy to turn back once the journey has begun, though quite a few have tried to abort the voyage with various narcotics including mysticism. It is a pilgrimage to an unknown destination, in which one awakes successively from one nightmare into another. Some of them appear vastly entertaining at the time. There are worlds within us, the abysses are just the initiations in between them.

The evocation of an octarine servitor can create an invaluable tool for those engaged in magical research. The main functions of such entities are usually to assist in the discovery of useful information and contacts. Negative results should not be ignored here; the complete failure of a well-prepared servitor to retrieve information about the hypothetical cosmic "big bang" was a contributory factor in the development of the Fiat Nox theory, for example.Lugh the Il-Dana came to Tara, the palace of the Tuatha De. Lugh, master of all arts, approached the gatekeeper, who did not recognize him. The gatekeeper asked Lugh his name and skill. Lugh replied, "I am Lugh Samildanach, master of battle." The gatekeeper responded that they already had a battle master, King Nuada de Danann. Lugh then claimed to be a master of healing, knowledge, sailing, sorcery, and smithing, but each time the gatekeeper stated they had masters for those skills. Finally, Lugh declared he was a master of all these arts and requested to see Nuada. The gatekeeper informed Nuada, who allowed Lugh to enter, recognizing his unique talents. Lugh was admitted to the palace and found his place among the Tuatha De Danann.The only person whose credentials we were able to verify was Dr. Jay Tibbles. Janette's claims, as given in her various pieces of literature, and as made to us, or to persons whose credentials we were able to verify, include: Hereditary Witch and Druid; Pipe Carrier for the Lumbee, the Sioux, the Cherokee, and the Chumash; member of the MotherGrove and Board of Directors of the ADF, as well as group marriage to the entire ADF Board of Directors; membership and 3rd Circle status in the British Circle of the Universal Bond; training by Ross Nichols, 3rd Degree Celtic and Egyptian Priestess; 3rd Degree Alexandrian Priestess, New York, 1973; 3rd Degree Gardinarian Priestess, New York, 1965; incorporation of her organization in 14 states; training by Rhuddlwm Gawr, and training by Grandmaster Eli (Barney Taylor, of the Druidic Craft of the Wise), marriage to Eli, as well as being both Eli's daughter and granddaughter. She has also claimed to be a registered nurse, a cosmetologist; a paralegal; a professional writer of romance novels, and a Vietnam Veteran. Ms. Copeland claims that she has 10,000 people on her mailing list, groves all over the United States, and that she was born in London during the Blitz, although she has also claimed that she was born in Houston, TX. Ms. Garcia claims that her father, a U.S. Army Major on Eisenhower's staff during WWII (not, by the way, Grandmaster Eli), and her mother, a nurse now resident in Atlanta, were both members of the Circle of the Universal Bond. She claims that she was raised by a Cherokee grandfather. She claims to have been teaching Wicca, which she says is a simplified version of Druidism for the masses, since 1954, when she was 12 years old.

Ms. Gordon took Lady Sabrin's course from Our Lady of Enchantment in 1987 and 1988, giving totally different information about herself than she gives now. According to Lady Sabrina, Janette has been selling Sabrina's courses as her own ever since. We have examined lessons from Janette's and Sabrina's courses, and they are indeed substantially identical, except that Sabrina can spell.

Janette joined ADF in 1987, giving yet another set of data about herself, claiming no leadership positions, newsletters, or other affiliations. A check of the material on her application shows it to be substantially false.

In checking Janette's claims, we contacted the Secretary of State and Board of Nursing Registrations in the 14 states in which she claimed incorporation. Her organization is incorporated only in Washington and California. She is not listed as a registered nurse anywhere we checked. She and her group were offering BA's, MA's, and PhD's in Washington State until directed to cease and desist by the Higher Education Coordinating Board. They later obtained a religious exemption by saying that they were offering degrees only in Divinity and Theology. Former members of their organization state that most of their claims in their catalog as to available courses and faculty credentials are false.

In examining their other claims we contacted over two hundred persons and groups in this country and abroad in an effort to authenticate their initiations and organizational affiliations.

No one we contacted verified any of the DCSG's claims. All stated that they had never trained or initiated any known officers or members of the DCSG. Most had never even heard of them. Further, former members of her organization have mentioned paying thousands of dollars for courses, and additional thousands paid out on "tithes" -- 10% of their annual income to support the work of the Order of Melchizadek (demanded in the middle of their initiation or elevation rituals). We have also been contacted by Social Services, Education, Law Enforcement, and other authorities for other information about DCSG, and/or its members.

ADF and some other Pagan groups and organizations are cooperating fully with these investigations, and have made it clear to the investigators that we do not regard these people as legitimate members of the Pagan community, since none of their alleged training and initiations can be verified, and may have been directly disproven. As Pagans, whatever our path, we can ill-afford to remain silent while groups knowingly steal and sell courses written by others, claiming training ties to the most senior and respected members of our community that they do not have, and engage in questionable behavior presenting themselves as our kin, elders, and representatives to the world at large.Rippling waters flow, casting a stone and the truth you'll know. When you have and hold a need, hearken not to others' greed. With a fool no season spend, nor be counted as his friend. Merry meet and merry part, bright the cheeks and warm the heart. Mind the threefold law ye should, three times bad and three times good. When misfortune is anow, wear the star upon thy brow. True in love you must ever be, lest thy love be false to thee. These eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye Will.

Bright Blessings to all. Here are invocations to the Goddess and God that I have used quite successfully in ritual. They are from the Orphic Hymns, updated for modern applications. Hope you enjoy them.

Invocation to the Goddess:
Divine are Your honors, Oh Mother of the Gods and Nurturer of All. Yoke your swift chariot drawn by bull-slaying lions and, O Mighty Goddess who brings things to pass, join our prayers. Many named and reverend, You are the Queen of the Sky. In the cosmos, Your throne is above all others, for You are Queen of the Earth, and You give gentle nourishment to mortals. Goddesses, Gods, and mortals were born of You, And You hold sway over the rivers and all of the sea. Hestia, Gaia, Demeter, Inanna, Isis, Astarte, Ishtar, Persephone, Diana, Giver of prosperity who bestows upon mortals all manner of gifts, Come to this Rite, Queen whom the drum delights. Honored and loving Nurturer of Life, Joyfully and graciously visit our deeds of piety. Blessed Be.

Invocation to the God:
Hear Our Prayer, O best and Many-Named God. Fine-haired, solitary, and full of lovely song; Many shaped and noble nurturer of all, Maiden and youth in one, unwithering bloom, O Adonis. You vanish and grow again in the fair seasons' turn. Kurnunnos, Pan, Myrddhn, two-horned Spirit of growth and blooming; Much loved and wept for are you, O Fair and Youthful Hunter of the luxuriant mane. Desire is in Your mind and You come to the Goddess in reverence and respect, in sensuous joy is your desire fulfilled. You are the seed planted in the depths of the Underworld that springs forth, the Green God, that we may sustain our lives. You sacrifice Yourself in gentleness when you are grown. Come Kind-Hearted One, Come Blessed God, and bring much joy to all. Blessed Be.

Hope you find these beneficial. Briget Bless...Phaedra.The common man may very well have believed in the literal existence of his many gods and goddesses, but we believe the elite of the Egyptian society understood that these neters were purely symbols. When the Egyptian elite paid homage to the neters, they paid homage to the aspects of the universe or of the self represented by those neters. One neter of obvious importance is Set. In dealing with this symbol, we try to identify the original meaning of the symbol, and try to eliminate the corruptions of the symbol imposed by the later rule of Osirian religion. Rather than take space here to discuss the corruptions and distortions that were applied to the symbol of the neter Set through the Osirian culture, we'll simply refer the interested student to appropriate books in the reading list: 2A, 2E, 2G, 2W, and 2AA. It is rather clear that the use and peripheral meanings of the neter Set changed over time. The study of Set must therefore include the careful consideration of the source of whatever writings are being studied. Fortunately, most other Egyptian symbols/god forms did not change significantly over time, and such care need not be used in studying and working with them. The neters were used and viewed as symbols. But the Egyptian temples were temples, and were recognized as religions, not simply as centers of enlightened philosophy. This brings up the question: Do/did the Egyptian Neters actually exist? Were these religions founded to worship or work with beings that actually existed? Or were they simply the creations of the ancient Egyptian priesthoods? Rather than tackle immediately the question of whether the Neters actually existed, workshop participants first chose to examine...

Egyptian Priesthoods
The first statement made about these priesthoods was that each temple in Egypt taught a different area of philosophy or knowledge. Those temples dedicated to a major neter or god taught that their primal Form was the First Cause. These were the major temples of the land, and an initiate who studied at temple after temple would be presented with the opposing claims that each god was the god, The Creator. We noted in our discussion that the priesthoods of several of the "minor" neters did not make any such claims. Thoth as a single neter never seemed to be treated as the creator god; nor was Geb. However, many of the major neters were treated as creator gods, and many gods were intentionally combined into units (such as Amon-Thoth-Ra) in order to form a god which would be powerful enough to qualify as The creator god.

Neters as Symbols
We returned to discussing the neters as ways of viewing possibility and potentiality, and ways of viewing different aspects of the universe and of the individual. For example, Ra, the sun god, was a most pervasive and powerful being, since every single day, there he is in the sky. Ra was consistent, reliable, and therefore powerful. Similarly, each force in nature was given a personality, because each force in nature has a personality (or seems to, to those who humanize such things). This is the basic principle behind most spirits of most animistic religions. These personalities are generally reliable. A rain cloud is going to rain; it isn't going to add to the day's heat. The Nile was not going to dry up -- it was going to overflow once a year, and deposit good, rich, fertile earth upon the ground. Each force of nature, each personality, was given a name, a face, and a story. The most powerful stories, faces, and names are those that belong to the creator gods. There are so many creator gods, that it's really difficult to pin down an actual order of precedence. This brings up the fact that there are many apparently conflicting stories within the Egyptian mythology. The Grand Master pointed out that in several Egyptian myths, Shu and Tefnut are self-created. In others, they were created by tears of the master creator god (whoever he happened to be according to the storyteller). In yet others, they were created by the master god's masturbation. Shu and Tefnut by definition are the first male and female. The master god's masturbation in these latter stories was always male masturbation, but Shu is the first male. Shu and Tefnut begat Geb and Nut, but Nut was the all-pervasive universal sky that preceded the first god... This confusion is the result of centuries of Egyptian storytelling, and while some of it appears to be contradictory, most of it is useful. We certainly must hesitate to consider this mythology as one consistent symbolism, and must be careful if we wish to communicate consistent meanings using these symbols, but we have found value in this mythology. Each story is a different way of looking at the world, a different way of looking at the first cause, and of looking at the symbols. By using these symbols, we can then indicate not only a symbol but also which way we are looking at the world. Hence, if in ritual or other communication we call upon Ptah-Geb-Nu, we are calling upon the creator of the earth and sky, the god who created the physical universe. If instead we call upon the Neter Ra-Ptah-ankh, we are calling upon the god who brought light and life to this planet.

Having discussed these differing views of the world as expressed by the many symbolic neters, we felt that this was a good point from which to launch into a discussion of one of the ways in which we look at Neters. Set, the prime source of intelligence and the ageless intelligence himself, is a wee bit complex for someone a mere 20 or even 200 years old to understand, regardless of whether we look at Set as an actually existing being or instead as a master symbol. So rather than try to encompass all of Set, intellectually or emotionally, rather than try to understand all of Set, we can work with neters which are facets of Set's being, facets of Set's symbolism. Each neter can be thought of as a specific element of Set. As examples, Shu is one set of symbolism, one set of ideas, that an initiate can work with to "get somewhere" with, to accomplish certain initiatory goals. Tefnut is another set of ideas, as is Geb, Isis, etc. Rather than trying to encompass and work with the entire universe simultaneously, grab whatever you can hold onto, work with that handful, study that symbol or symbols, and see what it leads to. We had originally intended to discuss whether or not the Neters might or might not exist in their own right. Having discussed the above, it seemed somewhat unimportant as to whether the Neters actually exist. That topic will be left for a later discussion.

It is characterized by classical scholarship, scientific and geographical discovery, and the exploration of individual human potential.

The Civil War (1640-1649) was between the Royalists under Charles I and the Parliamentarians led by Oliver Cromwell. Charles I was executed in 1649.

The Crusades were a series of wars undertaken by the Christians of Western Europe with the authorization of the Papacy from 1095 until the mid-15th century to recover the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem from the Muslims and defend possession of it.

The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was a major conflict involving Austria, Denmark, France, Holland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden that devastated central Europe, especially Germany. It began as a war between Protestants and Catholics but developed into a general power struggle.

The Lateran Councils were five ecumenical councils held at the Lateran Palace (the official residence of the Pope) between 1123 AD and 1512 AD.

Manichaeism was a dualistic Gnostic religion first preached by Mani in the 3rd century AD. Its early center was Babylonia, then part of the Persian Empire and a meeting place of faiths. The basic theology of Manichaeism is that good and evil are separate and opposed principles, which have become mixed in the world through the action of the evil principle. There is a complicated mythology that describes the creation of the world and the elements, and a set of complex correspondences by which the seeker can return to a state of salvation. Manichaeism spread across a huge area, including the Roman Empire. However, by the 6th century, it had virtually been eradicated from Spain, France, and Italy, although it was strong in the eastern Mediterranean until the 9th century, when it was absorbed into the neo-Manichean sects of the Bogomils, Cathars, etc.

The Bogomils were a religious sect that flourished in the Balkans between the 10th and 15th centuries. Their central teaching was strictly dualistic; that the visible, material world was created by the Devil, and that everything within it was therefore evil. They rejected many of the trappings of Christianity, and their condemnation of anything to do with the flesh - including eating and drinking - earned them the nickname, "the greatest puritans of the middle ages."

The Cathars were a heretical Christian sect that flourished in Western Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries. They believed that goodness existed only in the spiritual world created by God, and that the material world, created by Satan, was evil. Their theology bore a great resemblance to that of Manichaeism and the Bogomils, and they were closely connected with the latter.

The Waldensians, also known as Valdenses or Vaudois, were founded in southern France in the 12th century and emphasized poverty, abstinence from physical labor, and a life devoted to prayer. They were influenced by other "heretical" sects and rejected a number of the basic tenets of the Catholic faith. They were stern opponents of the acquisition of wealth and power within the Church and thus came into direct opposition to the Papacy, which thrived on both. They were fiercely persecuted, and by the end of the 15th century, confined mainly to the French and Italian valleys of the Cottian Alps. During the 16th century, the Waldensians were transformed into a Protestant church but suffered heavy persecution throughout the 17th century from the Dukes of Savoy. This ceased only after Oliver Cromwell intervened personally on their behalf with the duke, Charles Emmanuel II. In the latter part of the 17th century, the Waldensians returned to their original homeland, and in 1848 the Waldensians were given civil rights and are today members of the World Presbyterian Alliance.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

"I am the strength of the rock at thy back, the roots of the tree that anchor the Earth and deepest of tides in the black depths of the ocean. I am the Hunter and the Sacred Prey, the warmth of the sun in the swelling grapes and the call of the road that leads over the hill. I give you, my creatures, the fire of love, the power of the wind on your face, shelter from the darkest storm. You are dear to me, and I instill in you my power...the power of peace hard earned, the power of vision and magical sight, and the spark of elemental fire, which is the primal light in the darkness. By the powers of running stag and glorious sun, I charge thee; by the darkest depth of night and the lingering tendrils of dreams, I charge thee; and by the beauty of your own creation, I charge thee; Follow your heart and your instinct, wherever they lead you. The wealth of the heart will guide you where the cold edge of logic cannot take you. Take joy in the powers of your bodies. The form your body takes is unique in the universe and is chief among your tools. Lastly, always remember the path you have left behind you. Learn to take your power from the foolish things you have wrought as well as the good you have done for others and for your world. You can never usurp another's power, and yours is the well upon which you must rely. I am with you always, just over your shoulder, running with you through the tall grasses and forests that surround you. I possess you and I am your Sacred Prey. I am the Lord of Death, and when you have come to the end of your life on this world, I will be there; to take you between the worlds, to offer you peace and rest. Look upon my face; know me. I am the spirit of the wild things, but you too, are wild in your souls and we are forever intertwined."

The Charge of the Goddess

"I am the quickening of the seed in Springtime, the glory of ripe fields in Summer, and the peace of the quiet woods as the snow calms the Earth in Winter. I am the lilt of the maidens' melody in the morning, the patient hand of the Mother and the deep river of the mysteries taught by moonlight. I give the creatures of the earth the gifts of song rising from the heart, the joy of autumn sunset, the cool touch of the renewing waters, and the compelling call of the drum in the dance. To you I give the joy of creation and the companion of beauty to light your days. By the powers of the steadfast Earth and the wheeling stars I charge thee; by the darkness of death and the white light of birth I charge thee; and by the terrible strength of your human spirits, I charge thee: Strive always for the growth of your eternal soul, never intentionally diminish your strength, your compassion, your ties to the earth or your knowledge. Challenge your mind, never accept complacently that which has been the standard merely for the reason that it is the standard by which the majority judges itself. Thirdly, I charge thee, act always for the betterment of your brothers and sisters. To strengthen them is to forge the true chain of humanity, and a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You are my children, my brothers and sisters and my companions. You are known in great part by the company you keep, and you are strong and wise and full of the powers of life. It is yours to use them in my service, and I also, am known by the company I keep. Go forth in joy and the light of my love, turning to me without fear when the darkness threatens to overcome you, and turning also to me to share your triumphs and your achievements, and know in your heart of hearts that we are together in blood and spirit 'til the last star darkens in the sky and winter comes to the universe."

Charge of The Horned God

Hark unto me: for I am He who has existed throughout all time. I was there from the beginning; it was my potency that charged the fertility of the Great Mother and created life from her empty womb. Myself it is in the winds that sweep the worlds; myself it is in the flames that give warmth and light to all beings. I am he who provides: the Green Man of field and forest fruitfulness; the lust of the bull that engenders life upon the cow; the strength of the boar that engenders life upon the sacred sow of Ceridwen; the speed of the stag running free in the forest that no hunter can bring down save he who speaks the sacred words to call unto the spirit of the fleeing stag. I am Lord of the Dance; he who swirls through the starry universe with the world at his heels. I am he who dances on mountain and plain and hearth, and he who captures all things in his dance. And I am also Kernunn the Dark Hunter; he with visage as dark as void and armor bright with flame. My name is Lord of the Hunt; my prey those souls who needs must die and descend into the dark, chthonic depths of my bowel. For I bring life but death also; I am he at the gateway of the worlds, and to me shalt thou come in the end, thou who art my child and my prey.

RHYMING CHARGE OF THE GODDESS

I am the harmonious tune of the songbird and the laughter of a gleeful child. I am the bubbling sound of the running brook and the scent of the flowers wild. I am the floating leaf upon the breeze and the dancing fire in the forest glade. I am the sweet smell of rains upon the soil and the rapture of passion when love is made. I am the germination of seed in the Spring and the ripening of wheat in the Sun. I am the peaceful depth of the twilight that soothes the soul when day is done. I am found in the twinkling of an aged eye and found in the birth of a newborn pup. Yes, Birth and Growth and Death, am I. I am the gracious Earth, on whom you sup. I am your sister, your mother, the wise one. I wrap you gently in the warmth of my love. That which you seek you shall find within: Not without...not below...not above! Remember always, my children, be reverent. Be gentle, loving and kind to each other and hold sacred the Earth and its creatures: For I am the Lady: Creatrix and Mother!

Second Ritual For Bast

Gwen called me up to tell me that her nineteen-year-old Siamese cat Coco, who raised her from a small child and taught her innumerable wisdoms, had just come out of surgery and was not doing well. She talked about how her sister Lisa went to the vet every day to sit with him, talk to him, and give him her love. Gwen said she was burning a blue candle next to his picture in order to promote his healing, and was that O.K.? To answer her I mentioned as a gentle aside that I had heard that green was also good for healing. We talked about cats for a while. She cried. I remembered Buttons, fought tears, and then I understood what pain she faced here. She kept talking until I offered that I too might do a healing spell on his behalf. She jumped on my words with an eager "Oh! Would you?!" and I suddenly understood the real question behind this phone call. I explained that a cat who has seen nineteen summers has really had the best of it already, and that a spell which holds him to a body which is obviously failing him might be no kindness. She agreed. I explained that he might just be ready to go, now...since she has been raised, and even her little sister Lisa--with whom Coco lived--had just graduated college. I agreed to do a spell which sent him energy to do with as he chose, either to heal or to move on. She made a hopeful sound that with healing, he might choose to stay, then she hung up. I went quiet, thinking how best to do this. I mentally reviewed past spells that have worked, and why. Spells of "recovery" (whether they have been for illness, or finding Buttons when he was lost in a strange and distant city, or simply gaining the return of stolen things) have worked best when I look at the web as it was before the undesired event, compare it to the web as it is after, and (if the difference is not too great) then shape the web with my mind until it resembles what has been and consequently have the item in question pop back into my reality like a watermelon seed squeezed between thumb and forefinger. Here I sought to couch this knowledge within the Wiccan framework I am studying. I understand how the use of a ritual (or a language, an image, a habit, anything) taps into all those who have ever used the same thing, and knits their gifts together on the time-line. More mundanely, I understand how my own establishment of the habit of ritual will build powerful cues in my mind which make spell-work more efficient. Out of respect for what my teachers have been showing me, I determined to do it perfectly...while no one was around for me to feel awkward before. How might my Priestess teacher compose her Altar? What things, and what Deity shall be the focus? Well, obviously Bast...and such things as Bast might like. I thought back to the ritual I wanted to do with Bast for healing Le-oh. I plundered the memory of it for useful items. I remembered: Bast likes golden necklaces and other shiny things, images of cats, soft lights that don't damage night vision, and suddenly, I laughed aloud as I was inspired to offer Her cat-nip. It just felt right. So I laid these all out (along with the "usual" things): My first piece of jewelry--a golden cat pin, inscribed "Save a Cat" from the Save a Cat League of New York, my finest gold chain, two teak cats from the orient, my golden ankh, scarab necklace, and the spread-winged Horus-falcon I got when I visited the exhibition of Ramses II. I placed a bud-vase next to the water cup and went out into the night to gather a perfect sprig of fresh cat-nip. A deep breath, and I began by lighting the tiny oil lamps on Her Altar... Standing before Her altar I closed my eyes and reached for the images of the web when Coco was well and compared how it is now. Images slipped and swam. The differences were great. I pictured Gwen, her candles and photographs, and knitted us all into the circle with a breath. Then the images left. I opened my eyes and spoke softly but aloud. (I'm trying to cultivate that ability.) Before me, my cat images glimmered. I remembered the scene where Thomasina visits Bast. I went there too. I breathed energy into myself, and held it in my belly, as my Sensei taught me. Then I said: "Oh Bast--I'm here on behalf of your charge Coco, and his human, my friend Gwen. Coco is old, and it may be that his time has come. It's true he has lived long, but some cats do live longer. If this is still something about which there is uncertainty and choice, let him use this energy to heal. If it is really time for him to go, then I don't wish to stop him. Let him use this energy to go on into whatever comes next for him, and have an optimum and right... 'coming forth into the day'." (I wanted to say 'death and re-birth,' but suddenly that wasn't accurate here...) I then continued, asking: "Oh Bast, how hard is it to just let things be as they have been, for just a little longer? He is old, but old-age isn't a crime..." and suddenly a voice broke in just behind my right ear, and in perfectly lucid English She answered softly: "...and Death is no punishment." It shook me a moment. As soon as She said it I recognized She was right-- (hence--right side? Or R/L Brain?) It humbled me to realize I had thought that death WAS punishment. I knew that She was gone as soon as She had spoken, and there would be no point to turning to look. I felt the energy go out of me toward Coco, and I knew the spell had worked but that I hadn't gotten the answer Gwen wanted. That saddened me, even knowing what She said. I thanked Bast, thanked and dismissed the watch-towers, and went to bed to think about it all. Early the next morning Gwen called to thank me for talking to her, and to tell me there was no need to make the spell for Coco. He had died in his sleep during the night...now at least he wouldn't have to face another surgery. I told her I had already done the spell, and it was my feeling that Coco was o.k. I mentioned that I thought he had taken the energy for use in his next reality. I said everything I could think of to help her feel better. I don't recall whether I told her what Bast said to me or not. When I went to the altar to take it all down, I noticed the water level on the cat-nip had dropped below the stem and it had withered. Somehow that was fitting. It meant many sad and happy things all at once. It meant that She had accepted the gift by taking the essential freshness of the offering; It meant that things die, and that's natural; It meant that when the vitality is gone, the flesh cannot stay. So it is with what I know of death.

WCC BELTANE RITUAL

Personnel required: Several drummers and other musicians if possible. A priest and priestess who will represent the God & Goddess (and should be garbed appropriately), referred to herein as P & PS, plus a priest or priestess who will read the meditation and "stage-manage" the ritual (referred to herein as "N" for Narrator) Tools/Supplies required: Very few. There should be a fire in the center of the circle, and a chalice of wine and a bowl of Nine Holy Herbs spray or other concentrated alcohol (we ended up using Jamaican overproof rum, which worked very well -- flared up about six feet high!). Bring in the people and have them sit. Have the musicians sit together in an inner semi-circle, behind the Narrator. One drummer should be playing a slow, hypnotic heartbeat during the first part of the ritual. The priest and priestess who will represent the God and Goddess should be hiding near the circle, and approach when the part about them drawing near begins. N: "Beltane means many things. It is a celebration of spring coming into full flower, of the return of the Goddess from the underworld, the mating time of the animals, the return of the sun, and many other things. Above all, it is a celebration of life. But for us, here in this community, it is also the time when we leave the confines of our building and return to the temple of the forest. Wicca is a nature religion, but too often we worship in concrete cages, cut off from that nature, and from our own natures. And as we have now returned to nature in our choice of ritual site, I ask you tonight to return to nature in your hearts and minds as well, for the ways of the world within walls are not necessarily the same as the ways of the world outside. We meet in a small fragment of forest, within a city park. But now, I ask you to forget the city that surrounds us. In your mind's eye, let the city fade away and the forest extend on and on, covering the land that only moments ago was buried under concrete. For once this land was wild, and covered with trees, not buildings. Once the rivers and streams ran free, and the air was fresh and fragrant with the scent of cedar and sweet fern, not fouled by car exhaust and factory smoke. And it may be that one day, it will be so again, we have no way of knowing. But for now, picture the forest extending on and on, as far as you can imagine, in all directions. The great wild forest surrounds and embraces us, and we are the people of the forest. Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of a sword to cast the circle, for we have each other, our hands, our minds, our bodies. Join hands, and breathe in deeply, and breathe out, as one. Feel the circle being formed now by our touch, the energy leaping from hand to hand, deosil, around the circle. Feel it forming, a place set apart from the trials of daily life, a sacred, wild place... Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of a besom to cleanse our circle, for we meet in the wilderness, which is already clean and pure, and by its touch are we made clean and pure ourselves. Feel all fears, doubts and negativities ebbing away from you, as the forest absorbs them and transforms them to good... Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of incense to purify our circle, for we have the arching sky above our grove, and the rushing wind that ruffles our hair and caresses our skin. Breathe deeply, and take the wind and the sky into yourself. The spirits of the air are here always, it is we who have come to their place. Greet them, now, silently, in your own way... Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of a candle to purify our circle, for we have the balefire in the center of our circle, and the stars above. See the leaping flames now, hear their crackle, and see them reflected in the tiny fires in the sky above us. Feel their warmth, and take them into yourself. The spirits of the fire are here always, it is we who have come to their place. Greet them, now, silently, in your own way... Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of a water bowl to purify our circle, for we have the rushing stream in the valley beside us, and the dew that moistens the grass. Hear the water's call, now, feel the rising dampness in the air, and take it into yourself. The spirits of the water are here always, it is we who have come to their place. Greet them, now, silently, in your own way... Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of salt to purify our circle, for we have the earth itself, beneath us, and the firmness of our own flesh and bones. Feel the solidity, the vastness, of the earth, and take it into yourself. The spirits of the earth are here always, it is we who have come to their place. Greet them, now, silently, in your own way... Open yourself, now, to the pulse of life all around you. It is there, if you can free your spirit enough to sense it. Feel the life straining to be born in every sprouting seed, the exhilaration of the blossoms bursting from their buds on the trees, the joy of the very grass itself, of every bush and shrub and piece of moss, greening again as the earth is warmed by the sun, as the life-giving rains fall from the skyJanet and Stewart's consistent output has made their form of Wicca more likely to become the standard than any other type. Since their early days of undiluted Alexandrianism, they have drifted somewhat towards a more Gardnerian approach. Today, they tell everyone that there are no differences between the two traditions. In fact, despite the merging that has been occurring over the last few years, there are very distinct differences between the traditions; some merely external, others of a very significant difference of philosophy.

Seldiy Bate was originally magically trained by Madeline Montalban and then took an Alexandrian initiation from Maxine and Alex. Her husband, Nigel, was also initiated by Maxine, and they have been public witches for a number of years now, often appearing on TV, radio, and in the press. Their background in ritual magic is expressed in the type of coven that they run; a combination of Wicca and Ceremonial Magic.

In 1971, Alex and Maxine went their separate ways. David Goddard is a Liberal Catholic Priest, and for many years, he and Maxine worked in the Liberal Catholic faith and did not run a coven of any kind. Then in 1984, Maxine gathered together a group again and started practicing a combination of Wicca, Qabalah, and Liberal Catholicism. She and David separated in 1987, and since then her coven has been exclusively Wiccan. In 1989, she married one of her initiates, Vincent, and they are still running an active coven in London today.

Alex's history after the split was a little more sordid, with one girl he married, Jill, filling the gutter press with stories about Alex being homosexual and defrauding her of all her money to spend on his boyfriends. Sally Taylor was initiated by Maxine and David but then transferred to Alex. She was trained by him and then started her own group.

I'd now like to focus upon the last of the strands which I believe has been influential upon the birth and development of Wicca; that of the literary traditions and sources to which Gardner would have had access. To a certain extent, these are contiguous with the magical traditions described earlier, as nowhere is it ever suggested that Gardner did in fact ever work in a magical Lodge, so we must assume that his knowledge came from the written form of the rites, not from the actual practice of them.

From reading Gardner's books, it is quite apparent that Margaret Murray had a tremendous impact upon him. Her book, "The God of the Witches" was published in 1933, and twelve years previously, "The Witch Cult in Western Europe" had appeared. "The God of the Witches" has been tremendously influential on a number of people and certainly inspired Gardner.

In fact, "Witchcraft Today," published by Gardner in 1954, contained a foreword by Margaret Murray. At this time, remember, Murray's work was still taken seriously, and she remained the contributor on the subject of witchcraft for the Encyclopedia Britannica for a number of years.

Now, of course, her work has been largely discredited, although she remains a source of inspiration, if not historical accuracy. In Gardner's day, the idea of a continuing worship of the old pagan gods would have been a staggering theory, and in the second article in my series about Murray (published in The Cauldron), I made the point that Murray may have had to pretend scientific veracity in order to get her work published in such times. Don't forget that Dion Fortune had to publish her work privately, as did Gardner with High Magic's Aid.

Carlo Ginzburg's excellent book, "Ecstasies," also supports Murray's basic premise; although of course he regrets her historical deceptions.

There were of course other sources than Murray. In 1899, "Aradia: Gospel of the Witches" was published. Most of Crowley's work was available during the pre- and post-war years, as were the texts written and translated by MacGregor Mathers and Waite. Also readily available were works such as The Magus, and of course the classics, from which Gardner drew much inspiration.

Of paramount importance would have been "The White Goddess," by Robert Graves, which is still a standard reference book on any British Wiccan's bookshelf. This was published in 1952; three years after High Magic's Aid appeared, and two years before Gardner's first non-fictional book about witchcraft. I would just like to say at this point that Graves has taken some very unfair criticism in respect of this book. The White Goddess was written as a work of poetry, not history, and to criticize it for being historically inaccurate is to miss the point. Unfortunately, I agree that some writers have referred to it as an "authority," and thus led their readers up the garden path. This is not Graves's fault, nor do I believe it was his intention.

Another book which has had a profound influence on many Wiccans, and would undoubtedly have been well known by Gardner is "The Golden Bough"; although the entire book was written based upon purely secondary research, it is an extensive examination of many pagan practices from the Ancient World, and the emphasis of the male sacrifice could certainly have been taken from here equally as well as from Murray. Certain of the Gardnerian ritual practices were almost certainly derived from The Golden Bough, or from Frazer's own sources.

In "Witchcraft Today" Gardner mentions a number of authors when speculating where the Wiccan rites came from. He says that, "The only man I can think of who could have invented the rites was the late Aleister Crowley."

He continues to say, "The only other man I can think of who could have done it is Kipling...". He also mentions that, "Hargrave Jennings might have had a hand in them..." and then suggests that "Barrat (sic) of The Magus, circa 1800, would have had the ability to invent or resurrect the cult."

It's possible that these references are something of a damage control operation by Gardner, who, according to Doreen, was not too impressed when she kept telling him that she recognized certain passages in the Witch rites! "Witchcraft Today" was published the year after Doreen's initiation, and perhaps by seeming genuinely interested in where the Rites came from, Gardner thought he might give the appearance of innocence of their construction!

As mentioned previously, Gardner also had a large collection of unpublished MSS, which he used extensively, and one has only to read his books to realize that he was a very well-read man, with wide-ranging interests. Exactly the sort of man who would be able to draw together a set of rituals if required.

The extensive bibliography to "The Meaning of Witchcraft" published in 1959, demonstrates this rather well. Gardner includes Magick in Theory and Practice and The Equinox of the Gods by Crowley; The Mystical Qabalah by Dion Fortune; The Goetia; The White Goddess (Graves); Lady Charlotte Guest's translation of The Mabinogion; English Folklore by Christina Hole; The Kabbalah Unveiled and the Abramelin by Mathers; both Margaret Murray's books and Godfrey Leland's Gypsy Sorcery, as well as a myriad of classic texts, from Plato to Bede!

Although this bibliography postdates the creation of Gardnerian Wicca, it certainly indicates from where Gardner draws his inspiration from. There are also several books listed which are either directly, or indirectly, concerned with sex magic, Priapic Cults, or Tantra.

Hargrave Jenning, mentioned earlier, wrote a book called "The Rosicrucians, their Rites and Mysteries," which Francis King describes as a book, "concerned almost exclusively with phallicism and phallic images - Jennings saw the penis everywhere."

As I mentioned earlier, Hargrave Jennings, a member of the SRIA, also belonged to a group, described as a coven, which met in the Cambridge area in the 1870s, and performed rituals based upon the classical traditions - specifically, from The Golden Ass. There is no evidence to support this, except that there are often found references to a "Cambridge Coven" linked to Jennings' name. Many of the rituals we are familiar with today were of course later additions by Doreen Valiente, and these have been well documented by both her and the Farrars, in a number of books. Doreen admits that she deliberately cut much of the poetry by Aleister Crowley, and substituted either her own work, or poems from other sources, such as the Carmina Gadelica.

Of course, we can never really know the truth about the origins of the Wicca. Gardner may have been an utter fraud; he may have actually received a "Traditional" initiation; or, as a number of people have suggested, he may have created the Wicca as a result of a genuine religious experience, drawing upon his extensive literary and magical knowledge to create, or help create, the rites and philosophy.

What I think we can be fairly certain about is that he was sincere in his belief. If there had been no more to the whole thing than an old man's fantasy, then the Wicca would not have grown to be the force that it is today, and we would not all be sitting here in Canberra on a Saturday morning!Indeed, they may go the same way as the unicorns and their honey pots. Between Christopher Robin and Pooh, they have achieved sufficient development to leave their current plane and move on to higher things. Christopher Robin, as can be seen from his name, Christ/Robin, is a Tipherathic aspect of Pooh; the center where the lower and higher self come together. When they have united, the way is open and clear for them to move on to the next sphere of existence.

Thus, it should be every witch's ambition to be reincarnated as a bear of very little brain who lives in the hundred-acre wood on a plane at least one above this one. After all, the idiots we see running this world have to be seen as a damn sight more stupid than even Wol. (PS Mrs. Thatcher is also a Libran!)

The temple setup includes a veil in the northern quarter, a cauldron in the center, a stereo with taped music, a dish of corn seeds on the altar, pots of earth for each person, a pomegranate, candles, incense, and ritual weapons. The roles include the High Priestess (HPS) as the Goddess, the High Priest (HP) as the Horned God, a Priest to consecrate the seeds, and a drummer.

The ritual begins with the HPS casting the circle and invoking the quarters. The group faces the quarter being invoked and directs power with their athames. After the invocation, the group forms a circle and holds their arms aloft while the HPS calls upon the Lord and Lady.

The HPS, wearing a black silk robe and veil, stands at the altar and reads a declamation. The HP then reads a response, and the HPS calls for silence, emphasizing the importance of love, death, and resurrection in the new body, and magic.

The group stands, and the HPS assumes the pentagram position. The drummer takes his position, and the HP switches on the music tape and moves behind the veil. The HPS holds aloft the sword, and the group arranges themselves behind her, facing the veil. The HPS points the sword at the veil, and the group holds aloft their arms for the invocation to the Horned God.

The HPS invokes the Horned God, calling upon him by various names and symbols. The drummer speeds his rhythm to suggest hoofbeats, and after the invocation, the Horned God responds from behind the veil, inviting spirits to join the hunt. He enters the temple, moves widdershins, and leads a dance representing the Wild Hunt. The group stops dancing and seats themselves around the cauldron for a period of meditation.

The Priest consecrates the sacred seed, and the group plants their seeds in the prepared pots. The Horned God and Goddess do not plant seeds at the altar but charge their seeds and move behind the veil. The northern quarter candle is relit, and the consecration of cakes and wine follows. The ritual ends with the HPS thanking the quarters and the group making their farewells.The text discusses the evolution and misconceptions of Neopaganism, particularly Wicca, and its relationship with ancient pagan practices. It highlights the differences between ancient and modern interpretations of nature worship and the introduction of feminist elements into Wiccan theology. The text also delves into the historical figures like Gardner, Crowley, and Dr. Murray, who understood the balance of male and female principles in the universe. It critiques the political feminist agenda that has altered this balance into a near-monotheistic worship of the female principle. The narrative then shifts to a personal account of discovering what seemed to be the original Book of Shadows, its historical significance, and the confusion surrounding its authenticity. The author reflects on the implications of this discovery for the understanding of Wicca's origins and its connection to Crowley and the OTO. The text concludes with a discussion on the potential future of Wicca as an initiatory path versus a mere religion, emphasizing the importance of maintaining its initiatory nature to avoid becoming a dogmatic religion.The adjustment of the relationship between the selves in an organism. The basis difference between a magician and a civilian is that the latter's octarine power is vestigial or undeveloped. The normal resting or neutral mode of a civilian corresponds to a mild expression of the yellow power, which he regards as his normal personality or "ego." The magician self, however, is fully aware that this is but one of eight major tools that the organism possesses. Thus, in a sense, the "normal personality" of the magician is a tool of his magical self (and, importantly, vice versa). This realization gives him some advantage over ordinary people. However, the developing magical self will soon realize that it is not in itself superior to the other selves that the organism consists of, for there are many things they can do which it cannot.

The development of the octarine power through the philosophy and practice of magic tends to provide the magician with a second major center amongst the selves to complement the ego of the yellow power. The awakening of the octarine power is sometimes known as "being bitten by the serpent." Those who have been are usually as instantly recognizable to each other as, for example, two lifeboat survivors are.

Perhaps one of the greatest tricks of sleight of mind is to allow the magician self and the ego to dance together within the psyche without undue conflict. The magician who is unable to disguise himself as an ordinary person, or who is unable to act independently of his own ego, is no magician at all.

Nevertheless, the growth of the octarine, or eighth power of the self, and the discovery of the type of magician one wants to be, and the identification or synthesis of a god form to represent it, tend to create something of a mutant being, who has advanced into a paradigm that few others are aware of. It is not easy to turn back once the journey has begun, though quite a few have tried to abort the voyage with various narcotics including mysticism. It is a pilgrimage to an unknown destination, in which one awakes successively from one nightmare into another. Some of them appear vastly entertaining at the time. There are worlds within us, the abysses are just the initiations in between them.

The evocation of an octarine servitor can create an invaluable tool for those engaged in magical research. The main functions of such entities are usually to assist in the discovery of useful information and contacts. Negative results should not be ignored here; the complete failure of a well-prepared servitor to retrieve information about the hypothetical cosmic "big bang" was a contributory factor in the development of the Fiat Nox theory, for example.Lugh the Il-Dana came to Tara, the palace of the Tuatha De. The gatekeeper did not recognize Lugh and asked his name and skill. Lugh replied, "I am Lugh Samildanach, master of battle." The gatekeeper said they had no need for a battle master as King Nuada de Danann was their battle master. Lugh then claimed to be a master of healing, knowledge, sailing, sorcery, and smithing, but each time the gatekeeper responded that they already had masters for those skills. Finally, Lugh insisted, "I am Lugh Samildanach, master of all these arts. Take me to Nuada Airgitlamh." The gatekeeper went to Nuada, who, upon hearing of Lugh's arrival, said, "Let him come in, for never has his like entered this fortress." Lugh was admitted to Tara and found his place among the Tuatha De Danann.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

An animal does not reason, it experiences directly. Man is deceived by the incomplete testimony of his senses and his reason and has allowed the instinctive consciousness to atrophy without having learned to use his intuitive faculties which to the Egyptians, is the wisdom of the heart. Therefore there are ancient rituals to strengthen the heart.

Raise your eyes to know what relates to the laws of the heavens,
Look around you to study the principles of nature,
Look inside you to determine your attributes, to integrate your personality, and identify it with the heavens and nature,
One can cast your heart ahead on the Chosen Way, then go and retrieve it, and let your steps loyally follow its voice.

The Egyptian Way of Life is of Harmony;
Within the All-Inclusive Unity of God/desses,
Nature and Society;
Man can move with Dignity, Safety and Happiness.

The Egyptian essential Unity in the conviction that man can find immortality and peace by becoming part, or as one, with the perennial cyclic rhythms of Nature, a recurring movement, part of the established and unchanging Order of the Universe.

With the occasional exception, I will start posting notes on the different traditions; The Ceremonial Tradition, the Philosophical, The Arts and Crafts, the Hermetic like, the Wiccan like, the Alchemical, etc.

Stuck in between will be the occasional hymn to a god/dess, observations on astronomical god/desses; parts of man, temple structure, etc. Make any comments or questions that you want that are related.

THE PATH OF THE CRAFTSMEN IN ANCIENT EGYPT

One of the traditions in ancient Egypt was that of the artists and craftsmen. All of the best artists and craftsmen were trained in one place, the Temple of Ptah in Memphis (presently 20 min south of Cairo). All other artists and craftsmen were usually trained at the Temple or by people who were trained there.

These artists and craftsmen include: Architects, draftsmen, stone workers (large stones and small), jewelers, painters, eventually glass workers, dyers, (but not weavers, who studied at the Temple of Neith in the Delta). All the architects and draftsmen who produced all of the pyramids, temples, palaces, royal tombs, and even forts were trained here.

Have you noticed how all the men and women in paintings and statues have a similar body? Unlike the Greeks, who wanted to show how a person's body really looked like, the Egyptians were interested in showing the "inner essence" of the person. Therefore only in the background, the workers, and not the central family, are people shown as they really were, crippled people, occasional starvation, overweight persons, etc. Therefore the Egyptians were interested in the "inner man (or woman)".

Look at a book on Egyptian art and check out what the god/desses are holding or wearing. That is important to see what powers and attributes are being portrayed. For example, if Bes is holding a knife, she/he becomes a protector and avenger; if holding a sistrum, he/she (it's hard sometimes to tell which sex Bes is), becomes the God/desses of joy, pleasure, music, dance, and another kind of protector; if holding other objects or wearing other outfits, she/he becomes a Protector of Women and of the Family, of Mothers. The same holds true with all of the other gods and goddesses. Hence, Isis can be a Mother Goddess or a Goddess of Women, or of the Visible World depending on what she is wearing or carrying. All of this is taught by the temple of Ptah to the artists.

The similar thing occurs with amulets and talismans. Some amulets and talismans are always shown in a certain color or always made of certain material. The Buckle of Isis is almost always of red carnelian or garnets. The Ankh is almost never done in silver (because the ankh is associated with the Sun, and gold is the metal of the Sun).

The temple of Amon at Luxor is patterned after a human body; in fact, in the sanctuary part, if you observe the stones in the floor, you see that two different stones were used. If you had an archaeological map of the temple with the floor stones shown, and color in the darker stones, you end up with a huge side profile of a face! So the Temple of God reflected the Temple of Man!

Ptah had other powers and attributes than just artists and craftsmen (he was one of the Great Creator Gods), and was married to Sekhmet (who was into other traditions including healing). Ptah is also associated with the Science and Art of Alchemy. Their offspring is Nefertum, the God of perfumes and aromatherapy, and of the Lotus.

As you will see in future discussions, more than one god/dess is associated with a tradition. Ptah is one of the few gods who ever since predynastic periods, was always portrayed as a human.

Remember that most of the popular literature is from material of the New Kingdom and later periods. By then Horus was associated in the popular ancient Egyptian mind as the son of Isis, and especially popular as that during the Greco-Roman period.

RITUALS and RITUAL ELEMENTS

How many times do you get into a Book of Shadows and look at the rituals? How many of these rituals are complete from opening or drawing the circle, invocation of the four directions, blessings, consecrations, invocation, and closing? And how many are incomplete; in other words, missing some of the elements to the rituals, but maybe referring to use a certain 4 direction invocation or closing rite? Or missing complete elements; such as a hymn or invocation to a Goddess but no rituals around it?

To the major ancient Egyptian temple colleges, the elements of ritual were emphasized. A magician, priest/ess, magic worker at home would end up with several invocations to the four quarters, several closings, etc.

To the Egyptian; The Way of the Ritual; it's chief god/dess to be invoked and the way the ritual is to be directed (weather magic for example) will determine which other ritual elements are used.

Also remember that the Egyptians had generic ritual elements, usually blessings, consecrations and hymns. A generic hymn to a goddesses will have spaces in which the goddesses name, titles and some of her powers would be included.

There were more than one set of god/desses for the four directions; and even the direction that you started your ritual changes with the orientation of the ritual.

For example; if you wanted to do a ritual for fertility of the land, you start off facing south (the Life Giving Nile), then West (to appease the desert), then North (symbol of fertility), then the East (rising sun, cosmic fertility), then back to South. Naturally if you are solar oriented using gods like Amon, Ra, Horus, and goddesses like Sekhmet or Bast, you started with the east and work your way around (clockwise).

If you are invoking a goddess in your ritual you DO NOT invoke the four sons of Horus, UNLESS it is Isis or Nepthys that you are invoking. There are 2 sets of goddesses of the four directions, and one of the sets would do better.

There are at least three different sets of gods for the four directions, more, since Thoth has his own set, as does some cities.

I have a hand written 35 page list of powers and the god/desses associated with them. It probably corresponds to a book listed in the Library of the Temple of Horus called "The Book of God and Goddesses and their Powers".

So a magician at home would have more of a recipe collection of ritual elements rather than a book of Shadows of complete rituals, and would have the know how of how to put them together. I have about 3,000 such recipes, from Astral projection to Zoomorphic projections, including blessings, opening and closing rites, spells, divination, consecration, initiation, weather, tantric, etc. The Pyramid Texts contain about 700 more, and the Coffin Texts, over 1,200 more. Original, not new.

BAST

The only fully developed cult of the cat existed in Egypt and it lasted for over 3,000 years. No one knows when the cat was first sanctified in Egypt.

Bast wasn't associated with Isis until the New Kingdom, about 1600 BCE and later. When associated with Isis it came to be recognized as the incarnation of deity, and it was the daughter of Isis and her husband, the sun-god Osiris (Osiris was also a Moon-god) (Isis was also a Sun/Moon/Earth Goddess by then).

The worship of Bast overlapped that of Isis, Hathor, Mut and others depending on the district in Egypt.

Bast had a solar son, Nefer-tum (He is associated with unguents, perfumes, aromatherapy, alchemy, Lotus) by the Sun God Amen-Ra, and Khensu, the Moon God, by Ptah.

Bast or Bastet, was originally a lion headed goddess, associated in powers and attributes with Sekhmet and Tefnut, and as such, Bastet has powers of ferocity and rapacity.

It is her later cat-headed form that Bastet became so immensely popular, although she never ceased to be worshiped as a lion headed goddess.

The earliest known portrait of Bastet was found in a temple of the 5th dynasty, a lion-headed goddess who was known a "Bastet, lady of Ankh-taui." One of the earliest forms of her as a cat headed goddess is in a papyrus of the 21st dynasty.

Bast cult center was at Bubastis, situated east of the Nile delta, and hence, Bast became known as the "Lady of the East" (also because of her association with the sun).

She then, is almost without exception, invoked while facing the East, and is one of the Goddesses of the Four Directions.

In the XII dynasty, Middle Kingdom, she had her own temple at Bubastis. In the 22nd dynasty, about 950 BCE, she was known as the Lady of Bubastis and became an immense power in Egypt, due to the Pharaohs embracing her as a national goddess.

The temple of Bastet has been vividly described by the historian Heroditus, who travelled in Egypt about 450 BCE. It stood in the center of the city of Bubastis and was virtually on an island, since it was surrounded (except at its entrance) by canals from the Nile, which were a hundred feet wide and overhung with trees. While the houses were gradually raised, the temple remained on its original level so that the whole city commanded a view down into it.

The temple was a building in the form of a square, and was made of red granite. Stone walls carved with figures surrounded the sacred enclosure, which consisted of a grove of very tall trees within which was hidden a shrine. In the center of the shrine was a statue of Bast. Note: this is the only temple in Egypt known to have had a sacred grove of trees in the center of it, and a shrine in the center. There are other sacred groves, some with shrines; but instead of being inside of temples, these are all out in the open.

Cats were found within the sacred temple area and were ritually fed. Temple maidens carried cats or kittens in baskets. April and May were the chief festivals and rituals for Bast.

All cats were revered in the Temple of Bast. Now the question is, what kind of cats did the Egyptians have?

Orange cats
Orange stripped cats
A Tabby Type
Black Cats
Gray cats
And an Abyssinian type.
Of course, Bast is also associated with Lioness, so small cubs and adult lionesses were also sacred to her.

Of the principal Egyptian festivals, that of Bast was one of the most popular. Herodotus describes how, in April and May, thousands of men and women set off on the pilgrimage in parties which crowded into numerous boats. The voyage was gay if not positively orgiastic. Men played the flute, women a type of cymbal called crotala, and all joined in singing and hand-clapping. As they passed towns, the boats drew near to the banks and the women shouted bawdy jokes, often flinging their clothes up over their heads.

Eventually they arrived at Bubastis, sacrificing many animals, and consuming vast quantities of wine.

Cats were portrayed in every conceivable activity, sculptured every material from gold to mud, and in every size from colossal to minute size.

An orange brown cat is depicted on tomb walls, and so is a ginger cat, and grey tabbies.

During the Bubastite period (XXII dynasty), cat cemeteries became popular, and a huge profusion of cat amulets were being made.

During the entire time of Egypt, household cats were treated with the greatest respect. Many of them were bejewelled, and they were allowed to eat from the same dishes as their owners. Sick cats were tended with solicitude, and stray cats were fed with bread soaked in milk and with fish caught in the Nile and chopped up for them.

Cats love basking in patches of sunlight, and Bast was first worshipped as a form of the sun, the source and sustainer of life and light. Some of the Egyptians believed that when the Sun went down, a combat of cosmic proportions took place in the underworld. One of the legends had a persea tree with a cat with a knife leaping on a spotted serpent and cutting off its head. During solar eclipses people would gather in the streets and shake knives and rattle sistrums in an effort to spur on the celestial cat and to terrify the threatening serpent in their struggle beside the Tree of Life.

From the cat's identification with the sun arisen the "cat's cradle", a name given to certain string-games. The cats cradle was used to control the movement of the Sun through sympathetic magic.

Sekhmet was combined with Bast and Ra for a triparte goddess combining the attributes and powers of all three. It was a combination made for ceremonial magic only, as there is no public worship of Sekhmet-Bast-Ra at an individual level.

Are you soaking this all in with no questions?

Remember the story about the cat and the Persea tree that I just related? You should have asked about the Persea tree and if this Egyptian Tree of Life is or can be grown in the U.S. and if we know it by another name. Come on, ask, come on, come, after all, its the Cat's Meow!

There are two sacred trees in ancient Egypt. I mean SACRED! One is the acacia (which varieties grows all over the US. The other is the Persea. There are only 2 varieties of Persea in the entire world. One is the Egyptian persea, which I have no idea if it bears fruit. The other variety of Persea (which by Egyptian thought would be just as sacred) bears fruit. The other varieties common name is AVOCADO! That's right, the avocado is a sacred tree of the ancient Egyptians. So the next time that you are preparing to eat guacamole, remember that you are eating a sacred dip! The green avocado would probably also be sacred to Osiris and any other god/dess of vegetation. The ancient Egyptians usually made their wands out of acacia or persea, so if you have any of these trees, you can make yourself an Egyptian wand. Also remember that if you trim your tree, use the branches in the fireplace for a sacred fire!

To relate a story, true: When I was married my wife and I brought home a tabby, and a very young boy, about 5 came up and wanted to pet the cat. He asked me what was her name, and I replied that we haven't named it yet, what would he suggest? He said Abaton. I replied that I would consider it, thinking that it was a strange name for a kid to come up with (out of the mouths of babes...). About 3 days later, I was going over a book of cities and towns in ancient Egypt, and on a whim (which I have a lot of), looked up Abaton. LO AND BEHOLD, there was an Abaton in the Delta part of Egypt. AND IT WAS KNOWN AS THE CITY OF THE CATS WITH "TON" MEANING CITY, AND "ABA" MEANING CAT; OR "CAT CITY" to us folk. So our Tabby became known as Abaton, or Aba for short. A year later she became pregnant and we decided that in honor of the Egyptian intercalary days (those 5 remaining days of the ancient Egyptian calendar of 365 days, divided into 12 months of 30 days with 5 intercalary days left over, sacred to certain god/desses); as the kitties would pop out (so to speak), we would start naming them for the 5 god/desses. Well, eventually here they came, Isis, Nepthys, Osiris, Horus, and the last, a black kitty, Set. Set died that night, the only one that didn't live to a ripe old age. Horus grew up (a male cat by the way, we named them regardless of sex; when the first popped out, it became Isis; luckily sexually matched their names) to be a hunting cat, who would bring home live rabbits bigger than he was. Nepthys, a black female, was a loveable, loving cat who went to an excellent Wiccan friend, along with Isis, who was occasionally disruptive, usually loveable. Osiris stayed with us and even disappeared for a little over 2 months (close to the 72 day mummification process) until we thought that he was dead, but he came back and lived out his life playing big daddy, master of his domain, and approving the field mice and rabbits that brother Horus would bring back for his approval. They are all gone none, but never forgotten. I now have 2 cats, a blue eyed, long white furry female originally called "Popcorn" (forgive her previous owners, Lord and Lady, they do not know better), but now called Sheba (although, to be truthful, she answers to any name). The other is a Calico, previously named Nikita (little one in Russian, and she is a little cat); now called Spook (she spooks easily, still hasn't figured out shadows yet, and doesn't come to any name called to her).

Sheba, by the way, will willingly join you in the bathtub if you're taking a bath! In ritual she just lays there looking bored, but Spook, ah Spook; stays inside the circle and even watches the entities!

FROM LDE BLACK Cat Fancy March 1993 pg 13, at bottom.
A French scientist has found evidence confirming that the domestic cat existed 4,000 years ago. During excavations of ancient Egyptian burial chambers, Alain Pierre Zivie, an Egyptologist, found a network of tombs that contained stacks and stacks of cat mummies. "Some historians believe the first house cats were wild with long coats,""I am the strength of the rock at thy back, the roots of the tree that anchor the Earth, and the deepest of tides in the black depths of the ocean. I am the Hunter and the Sacred Prey, the warmth of the sun in the swelling grapes, and the call of the road that leads over the hill.

I give you, my creatures, the fire of love, the power of the wind on your face, and shelter from the darkest storm. You are dear to me, and I instill in you my power—the power of peace hard-earned, the power of vision and magical sight, and the spark of elemental fire, which is the primal light in the darkness.

By the powers of the running stag and the glorious sun, I charge thee; by the darkest depth of night and the lingering tendrils of dreams, I charge thee; and by the beauty of your own creation, I charge thee:

Follow your heart and your instinct, wherever they lead you. The wealth of the heart will guide you where the cold edge of logic cannot take you. Take joy in the powers of your bodies. The form your body takes is unique in the universe and is chief among your tools. Lastly, always remember the path you have left behind you. Learn to take your power from the foolish things you have wrought as well as the good you have done for others and for your world. You can never usurp another's power, and yours is the well upon which you must rely.

I am with you always, just over your shoulder, running with you through the tall grasses and forests that surround you. I possess you and I am your Sacred Prey. I am the Lord of Death, and when you have come to the end of your life on this world, I will be there to take you between the worlds, to offer you peace and rest. Look upon my face; know me. I am the spirit of the wild things, but you too are wild in your souls, and we are forever intertwined."An animal does not reason; it experiences directly. Man is deceived by the incomplete testimony of his senses and his reason and has allowed the instinctive consciousness to atrophy without having learned to use his intuitive faculties, which to the Egyptians is the wisdom of the heart. Therefore, there are ancient rituals to strengthen the heart.

Raise your eyes to know what relates to the laws of the heavens,
Look around you to study the principles of nature,
Look inside you to determine your attributes, to integrate your personality, and identify it with the heavens and nature,
One can cast your heart ahead on the Chosen Way, then go and retrieve it, and let your steps loyally follow its voice.

The Egyptian Way of Life is of Harmony;
Within the All-Inclusive Unity of God/desses,
Nature and Society;
Man can move with Dignity, Safety, and Happiness.

The Egyptian essential Unity in the conviction that man can find immortality and peace by becoming part, or as one, with the perennial cyclic rhythms of Nature, a recurring movement, part of the established and unchanging Order of the Universe.

With the occasional exception, I will start posting notes on the different traditions; The Ceremonial Tradition, the Philosophical, The Arts and Crafts, the Hermetic like, the Wiccan like, the Alchemical, etc. Stuck in between will be the occasional hymn to a god/dess, observations on astronomical god/desses; parts of man, temple structure, etc. Make any comments or questions that you want that are related.

THE PATH OF THE CRAFTSMEN IN ANCIENT EGYPT

One of the traditions in ancient Egypt was that of the artists and craftsmen. All of the best artists and craftsmen were trained in one place, the Temple of Ptah in Memphis (presently 20 min south of Cairo). All other artists and craftsmen were usually trained at the Temple or by people who were trained there.

These artists and craftsmen include: Architects, draftsmen, stone workers (large stones and small), jewelers, painters, eventually glass workers, dyers, (but not weavers, who studied at the Temple of Neith in the Delta). All the architects and draftsmen who produced all of the pyramids, temples, palaces, royal tombs, and even forts were trained here.

Have you noticed how all the men and women in paintings and statues have a similar body? Unlike the Greeks, who wanted to show how a person's body really looked like, the Egyptians were interested in showing the "inner essence" of the person. Therefore, only in the background, the workers, and not the central family, are people shown as they really were, crippled people, occasional starvation, overweight persons, etc. Therefore, the Egyptians were interested in the "inner man (or woman)."

Look at a book on Egyptian art and check out what the god/desses are holding or wearing. That is important to see what powers and attributes are being portrayed. For example, if Bes is holding a knife, she/he becomes a protector and avenger; if holding a sistrum, he/she becomes the God/desses of joy, pleasure, music, dance, and another kind of protector; if holding other objects or wearing other outfits, she/he becomes a Protector of Women and of the Family, of Mothers. The same holds true with all of the other gods and goddesses. Hence, Isis can be a Mother Goddess or a Goddess of Women, or of the Visible World depending on what she is wearing or carrying. All of this is taught by the temple of Ptah to the artists.

The similar thing occurs with amulets and talismans. Some amulets and talismans are always shown in a certain color or always made of certain material. The Buckle of Isis is almost always of red carnelian or garnets. The Ankh is almost never done in silver (because the ankh is associated with the Sun, and gold is the metal of the Sun).

The temple of Amon at Luxor is patterned after a human body; in fact, in the sanctuary part, if you observe the stones in the floor, you see that two different stones were used. If you had an archaeological map of the temple with the floor stones shown, and color in the darker stones, you end up with a huge side profile of a face! So the Temple of God reflected the Temple of Man!

Ptah had other powers and attributes than just artists and craftsmen (he was one of the Great Creator Gods), and was married to Sekhmet (who was into other traditions including healing). Ptah is also associated with the Science and Art of Alchemy. Their offspring is Nefertum, the God of perfumes and aromatherapy, and of the Lotus.

As you will see in future discussions, more than one god/dess is associated with a tradition. Ptah is one of the few gods who ever since predynastic periods, was always portrayed as a human.

Remember that most of the popular literature is from material of the New Kingdom and later periods. By then Horus was associated in the popular ancient Egyptian mind as the son of Isis, and especially popular as that during the Greco-Roman period.The Light Bearer

Female power of Light, Heat, Sun, Fire, Mild Heat of the day and Year. Power of germination of seeds. Power of early Summer. Goddess of the Birth Chamber. Goddess of Full Moon. Goddess of Cats. Protection.

Bast festivals occur in April and May in her temple at Bubastis, facing east. The Greeks associated her with Diana. Bast was also used to learn words of power to vanquish the powers of darkness (IVth Dynasty). Bast attributes are also related to cats.

Bast had at least four different forms. She originated in the Nile delta, but by 930 B.C., the power of Bast was acknowledged by all Egyptians. At first, she was a lion-goddess of sunset, symbolizing the fertilizing force of the sun's rays. Later, her image grew tamer: she became a cat carrying the sun, or a cat-headed woman who bore on her breastplate the lion of her former self. Bast ruled pleasure and dancing, music and joy. At Bubastis ("House of Bast"), the center of her worship, great celebrations were held. Boatloads of worshipers - hundreds of thousands of them, Herodotus said - were greeted by pleasant flute melodies as they debarked for a worship service combined with a vast trade fair. Bast's followers believed that in return for this reverent celebration Bast bestowed both mental and physical health.

As a cat goddess of the moon, she lit up the night, throwing light on things which would otherwise be concealed. Moon lights up a world hidden in darkness, and the cat gives us insight with her light of the under, or inner world. The Moon is the searcher, a seeker of Truth. Bast is known as the Lady of Truth. Beams of the moon point the way and a narrow path called a cat walk, usually called in Egyptian as the Middle Way or Path.

When a cat curls up with its head touching its tail, it forms a circle, symbol of eternity. Bast also symbolizes sensuality, grace, coordination of movement.

Bubastis (town of Bast) also called Per-Bast, Pa-Bast, Pibeseth, Tell-Basta. Location: lower Egypt, northern kingdom and capital of the 18th nome or state, Am-Khent. Time Period of Bubastis: IInd Dynasty to at least 640 AD. IInd Dynasty: "in the reign of the 1st king, a chasm opened up and many people perished." IV: Khufu (builder of the Great Pyramid) built here. XXII: Libyans ruled Egypt here. 640 AD: Bubastis still alive and worshipping cats here. Temple of Bast on an island with only an entranceway bridging it. There is also a Temple to Thoth, and a shrine to Temit. Minor gods: Temit: Lady of the Two Lands and Osiris: the thigh of Osiris is in a hidden chest at Netert.

Triad at Bubastis: Bast, Osiris, Heru-hekennu, and to a lesser extent: Nefer-tem. Invoke the cat Bast to learn words of power to vanquish the powers of darkness (IVth dynasty on).

Bast attributes related to cats: refusal to take things overseriously, science of relaxation, never waste energy, accepts the nature of things, superb indifference to opinion, refusal to be at beck and call, insistence of complete freedom of expression. When a cat curls up with its head touching its tail, it forms a circle, symbol of eternity. Luxuriating sensuality, grace, coordination of movement. Egyptian cats are typically orange-brown, ginger and a gray tabby. As a lioness, (her earliest forms), painted green, she personifies the Sun. As a cat, she has connections with the moon. Mother of lion god Ari-hes of Aphroditopolis, Mother of Sekhem, of Denderah. Bast is also considered to be the Soul of Isis.

Forms usually seen:
1. Upright cat, holding a sistrum and aegis, surrounded by four protector cats.
2. Woman's body, head of lion or cat, holding sistrum and either a basket or an aegis (can hold uatchet).
3. Aegis of Bast sometimes has a head of a cat crowned with solar disk and uraeus, emblems of Sekhmet.
4. Lion-headed woman, oldest form of Bast. In 5th Dynasty temple called, "Bastet, Lady of Ankh-Taui."

Also associated with:
Mut-Bast: personification of the moon in Thebes, she is a woman wearing horns on her head with a sun's disk between them. Mut-Bast is the counterpart of Amen-Ra-Temu-Khepera-Heru-Khuti. Sekhmet, as a counterpart. Assessor Thenemi (he who goes backwards) and who comes forth from Bast. Assessor Basti.

A good description of the Festival of Bast, called the Festival of Lights, has been described by various Greek and Roman writers. The temple of Bast in Bubastis, while on an island, is lower than the rest of the city, and therefore, is the only temple that the people can see into the courtyard. Also, there is a sacred grove of trees in the courtyard (the only one known of all temples in Egypt). At the festival of Lights, all light in the city is extinguished. Then a new fire is made in the temple and the priests come out to light the torches of the people who then parade throughout the city to relight all the home fires. By the Greek/Roman period, there was also a kind of sexual license at the time at the festival. Food and drink for all (which is typical of the temple festivals).

Speaking of cats! I had a request from Jennifer about Wadjet, the rearing cobra, sometimes lioness. Good observation, most people don't know that Wadjet is VERY occasionally depicted as a Cat. Here is the answer.

Wadjet, the cobra depicts two things: the real snake (in the proverbial papyrus grass) with its dangerous forms and powers. And 2, the Kundalini, or Serpent Fire of the human body coming out of the third eye! That's why the serpent is always on the crown or is the crown over the third eye. It's also symbolic of the sun. I know, you think that the Kundalini comes out of the top of your head, as Hindus would have you believe. Could be true, but in Egypt, when one works with Wadjet's fire, you direct the route to the third eye (the burning, purifying fire), while redirecting a lesser (gentle growing heat of the sun) to the top of your head (hence, the Lotus depicted on top of the head).

So, yes, different aspects of her nature. As depicted as Wadjet the cat, here is a dichotomy! Cats protect humans from snakes, so Wadjet is also invoked to protect humans from her very own physical manifestation, the deadly cobra. As depicted as a cat, it shows her protection from her very real counterpart, the asp. Asp and you shall receive!

Now as to relationships with Bast/Sekhmet/Mut. Think of fire and think of sun/moon. Think of opposing sections of the same thing (burning fire, gentle heat; light of day, dark of night) and you have some basic differences between Bast/Sekhmet. Have you seen the National Geographic special on cats: our pets and how they relate to the big cats. Think of the attributes of the big cats and think of Sekhmet; think of the attributes of the domesticated cats (really, cats domesticate people) and think of Bast. The shared attributes of Bast and Sekhmet are the same as the shared attributes of big vs. little cats. Mut is a maternal cat, big or small.

Sekhmet destroys, but she is also a healer. Bast is playful, but also protective. When the Christians decided to kill all the cats in Egypt in the 700's AD, they did so. Two years later, the Black Death came out of Egypt and devastated Christian Europe. Was this revenge by Sekhmet and Bast onto the Christian population for destroying their physical symbols, the little kitties? Or was it because the amount of cats kept down the rat population enough that the Black Death (a rat flea borne disease) didn't come out until the decline of the cats? Or both?Though the long nights ahead too. Later tonight, place the bread outside with a prayer and your thanks for the gift of Life. Breathe deep, feel the Life within. Feel the veins throb with life. Feel the bread of Life recharging your life force. Meditate on this, that Life comes from Death, and Death from Life. The cycle goes around, and we are a part of it, as surely as the Corn King himself.

Caitlen dismissed the Watchtower of the East, thanking the spirits of the air for their presence and asking them to stay with the group as they pass through the earth. Jehana dismissed the Watchtowers of the North, expressing gratitude to the creatures and watchers of the land beneath their feet. Ladyhawk dismissed the Watchtower of the West, thanking the Lords of Water for attending. Shadowstar dismissed the Watchtower of the South, expressing thanks to the Power of Fire.

The group thanked Lady Faire for attending the Rite and for the blessings of Life. They also thanked the Sun King, Corn King, for the gift of Life. They expressed gratitude to the Lady and Lord for their attendance and asked to walk with the knowledge and love of them in their hearts. The Circle around them sank down into the Earth, carrying Life itself into the ground, fertilizing and charging the Earth for the coming night. The Circle gradually disappeared from sight, starting in the East, moving back to the North, then to the West, and finally to the South, ending at the beginning. The Circle was open but never broken. They concluded with "Merry Meet, and Merry Part, and Merry Meet again!" and marked the end of the Rite, signaling the start of revelry.The ritual began with the Priestess and Priest invoking the elements and the deities. The Priestess called upon the Lady to teach them of love, beauty, and sensuousness, while the Priest asked for lessons in daring, adventure, and the crafting of spells. They envisioned themselves stepping through a mirror into a moonlit night, walking through meadows and forests, encountering magical groves and caves filled with mystical pools and a great cauldron. They performed a meditation, visualizing themselves becoming healthier and more perfect.

The ritual continued with a healing ceremony for Rilla, where the group sent healing energy to her. They also sent healing power to their brother Otter and other absent members. Shadow Hawk requested to charge a wand with the night's energy, and the group visualized the fire bonding the wand with power.

The ritual concluded with the sharing of bread and wine, symbolizing the gifts of the earth and the sweetness of life. They thanked the Goddess and God for their presence and blessings. The elements were dismissed, and the circle was opened but unbroken, ending with the traditional farewell: "Merry Meet, Merry Part, and Merry Meet again!"The Light Bearer, Female power of Light, Heat, Sun, Fire, Mild Heat of the day and Year, Power of germination of seeds, Power of early Summer, Goddess of the Birth Chamber, Goddess of Full Moon, Goddess of Cats, Protection.

The group then called upon the spirits of the elements, starting with the East, invoking the powers of air, and moving to the South, West, and North, each time asking for protection and blessings. They performed various rituals, including lighting fires and incense, and visualizing ties breaking with the flame.

The Dark Lord guided them to cast off their bonds and be free, leading them to a land of youth and healing. The group released their fears by burning paper in the incense fire, each person naming their fear aloud.

The High Priestess and High Priest stood in the center by the altar, envisioning fruits like pomegranates and apples, symbolizing life and death. They shared a chalice and bound the hands of the bride and groom with cords, symbolizing their union.

The ritual ended with the dismissal of the elements and a final blessing from the Goddess and God. The circle was unwound, and the group departed with the traditional farewell: "Merry Meet, Merry Part, and Merry Meet again!"The text discusses the influence of Dion Fortune on modern Witchcraft, particularly through her novels and writings. It highlights how her works, despite the Society of the Inner Light's disavowal, could have influenced Gerald Gardner and his initiates. The text also explores the themes in Fortune's novels, such as the integration of Greek culture and the balance between Christianity and Paganism. It mentions the ritual "Drawing Down the Moon" and its significance in Gardnerian Witchcraft, as well as the contributions of Doreen Valiente.

Shadowstar dismissed the Watchtower of the South, thanking the power of fire. The circle was closed with gratitude to the Lady and Lord for their blessings and attendance. The circle was visualized sinking into the earth, carrying life itself into the ground, fertilizing and charging the earth for the coming night. The circle gradually disappeared from sight, and we returned to this world. The circle is open, but never broken. Merry Meet, and Merry Part, and Merry Meet again! The rite concluded, but the revelry had just begun.The ritual began with the Priestess and Priest invoking the elements and cleansing the space. The Priestess added salt to water, symbolizing earth and water, and blessed the cup for cleansing. The incense of juniper and myrrh was used to purify the air and fire. The circle was cast, and the Guardians of the East, South, West, and North were called upon to protect and guide the ritual.

The Priestess described the setting: a grove amidst tall oaks, lit by a waning moon and torches. The altar was decorated with apples, pomegranates, nuts, and corn. A cauldron of cleansing and a large black iron dutch-oven stood in the center. The participants cleansed themselves with the blessed water and incense.

The Priestess and Priest led the group in banishing negative energies by writing them on paper and burning them in the cauldron. They then shared wine and cakes, symbolizing the blessings and abundance of the Lord and Lady.

The Guardians were thanked and released, and the circle was opened but never broken.

The ritual ended with a sense of renewal and transformation, ready to begin anew.The contribution of Dion Fortune to "the Craft" has not been sufficiently acknowledged, with one exception. The works of English Witches, Janet and Stewart Farrar, frequently refer to Dion Fortune. They laid out a ritual based on one in Fortune's novel "The Sea Priestess" and received permission from the Society of the Inner Light to do so. The Society clarified that Dion Fortune was not a Witch and had no connection with a coven, and that the Society is not associated with the Craft of Witches. Despite this, a good circumstantial case can be made that Fortune's works, particularly her novels, could have influenced Gerald Gardner and his initiates. This insight was evident while reading "The Goat-Foot God," published two years before Gardner's initiation into the Craft. Its plot involves a person near psychological collapse being rescued by a powerful magician or priestess and reintegrated socially and psychically. The character of Jelkes, the bookseller, remarks that writers will put things into a novel that they daren't put in sober prose. Fortune's literary output included both novels and "sober prose" titles like "Practical Occultism in Daily Life" and "The Mystical Qabalah." Her novels convey a message using a more consciously Pagan vocabulary, suggesting that Christianity has had its day and a new Renaissance is dawning. The notion of injecting a key idea into the collective unconscious of Western humanity appears repeatedly in Fortune's novels. She called for attention to be paid to the Great Goddess, a theme carried on by modern Witchcraft. The ritual "Drawing Down the Moon," developed by Gardner and his contemporaries, involves invoking the Goddess in the body of the priestess, a concept discernible in Fortune's "The Sea Priestess." The Farrars openly admitted a debt to Fortune, acknowledging her influence on modern Witchcraft. The Great Goddess becomes central in Gardner's works from the 1950s, and her influence is evident in the construction of key rituals. Doreen Valiente, who re-wrote the "Drawing Down the Moon" ceremony, also drew upon Fortune's works. Although Gardner and Fortune were contemporaries, it is unclear if they ever met. However, Valiente, initiated by Gardner, was fond of Fortune's books, especially her novels. Given the interwoven cliques of occultists in England, it is unlikely that Gardner and Valiente were unaware of Fortune's novels. The circumstantial case for Fortune's influence on modern Witchcraft fits the chronology, suggesting she played a significant role in its development.Giving a gift was a sign of friendship, kinship, and connection. By sharing a blot with the Gods, we reaffirm our connection to them and reawaken their powers within us and their watchfulness over our world. A blot can be a simple affair where a horn of mead is consecrated to the Gods and then poured as a libation, or it can be part of a larger ritual. A good comparison is the Catholic Mass, which may be part of a regular service or special event such as a wedding or funeral, or it may be done as a purely magical-religious practice without any sermon, hymns, or other trappings.

The blot consists of three parts: the hallowing or consecrating of the offering, the sharing of the offering, and the libation. Each of these is equally important. The only tools required are mead, beer, or juice, a horn or chalice, a sprig of evergreen used to sprinkle the mead, and a ceremonial bowl known as a Hlautbowl into which the initial libation will be made.

The blot begins with the consecration of the offering. The Gothi (Priest) or Gythia (Priestess) officiating at the blot invokes the God or Goddess being honored. This is usually accomplished by a spoken declaration with one's arms held above one's head in a Y shape, in imitation of the rune elhaz. This posture is used for most invocations and prayers throughout Asatru. After the spoken invocation, an appropriate rune or other symbol of the God or Goddess may be drawn in the air with the finger or with the staff. Once the God is invoked, the Gothi takes up the horn. His assistant pours mead from the bottle into the horn. The Gothi then traces the hammer sign (an upside-down T) over the horn as a blessing and holds it above his head, offering it to the Gods. He then speaks a request that the God or Goddess bless the offering and accept it as a sacrifice.

The mead is now not only blessed with divine power but has passed the lips of the God or Goddess. The Gothi then takes a drink from the horn, and it is passed around the gathered folk. Although it sounds like a very simple thing, it can be a very powerful experience. At this point, the mead is no longer simply a drink but is imbued with the blessing and power of the God or Goddess being honored. When one drinks, one is taking that power into oneself. After the horn has made the rounds once, the Gothi again drinks from the horn and then empties the remainder into the hlautbowl. The Gothi then takes up the evergreen sprig and his assistant the hlautbowl, and the Gothi sprinkles the mead around the circle or temple or onto the altar. If there are a great number of the folk gathered, one may wish to drop the drinking and merely sprinkle the various folk with the mead as a way of sharing it. In a small group, one might merely drink as the blessing. When this is done, the Hlautbowl is taken by the Gothi and poured out onto the ground. This is done as an offering not only to the God invoked at the blot, but it is also traditional to remember the Earth Mother at this time, since it is being poured onto her ground. Many invocations mention the God, Goddess, or spirit being sacrificed to, and then Mother Earth, as in the Sigrdrifa Prayer "Hail to the Gods and to the Goddesses as well; Hail Earth that gives to all men." (Sigrdrifumal 3) With this action, the blot is ended.

Obviously, this is a very sparse ritual and if performed alone could be completed in only a few minutes. This is as it should be, for blots are often poured not because it is a time of gathering or festivity for the folk, but because the blot must be poured in honor or petition of a God or Goddess on their holiday or some other important occasion. For example, a father tending his sick child might pour a blot to Eir, the Goddess of healing. Obviously, he doesn't have time to waste on the "trappings" of ritual. The intent is to make an offering to the Goddess as quickly as possible. At some times, a full celebration might not be made of a holiday because of a person's hectic schedule, but at the least, a blot should be made to mark the occasion. However, in most cases, a blot will at least be accompanied by a statement of intent at the beginning and some sort of conclusion at the end. It might also be interspersed with or done at the conclusion of ritual theater or magic. Our kindred, for example, begins the ritual with a chant of "Odin, Vili, Ve" which connects us to the Gods of creation. Between the invocation of the God or Goddess and the actual Blot, we usually add a meditation or something else which acts as a focus of the ritual. Once, for example, we made mead in the middle of a ritual to Aegir. As part of our blot, we also pass the horn three times. The first time around is a taking in of the power of the charged mead and all offer a toast to the God(s) of the occasion. The second and third rounds are open to toasts to other Gods, toasts to the kindred, the hosts, to pledges, boasting, and anything else one wishes to say. It is essentially a "mini sumble" in the middle of our blot. Always, of course, we remember the purpose of our ritual. We would never toast one of the Jotnar during a ritual to Thor, for example. We have also added a few steps at the end which are a private affirmation of our group's kinship with each other and with the Gods.

Basic Outline of the Blot Ritual:
I. Sanctify space with the Hammer rite
II. Invocation of the Deity
III. Secondary Activities supporting the blot: meditation, etc.
IV. Load mead by offering it to the God
V. Pass mead for blessing or sprinkle on folk
VI. Other activities, prayers, etc.
VII. Thank the deity
VIII. Pour the libation to the Earth

THE NECKLACE OF A THOUSAND STRANDS
In the beginning that ever was and ever shall be, there was only Night. She lay sleeping. In Her sleeping, She dreamed. In Her dreaming, She sighed. In Her sighing, She turned and in Her turning, She awakened. In Her awakening, She saw naught but Herself, and found Herself beautiful.

Long did She delight in Her beauty, Her perfection. Her softly rounded limbs, full body, and flowing hair were so magnificent that She wished to adorn Herself.

She captured Her thoughts, each a brilliantly colored speck of light, and strung them together to form a Necklace of a Thousand Strands. This She donned and was pleased.

Each speck sparkled with its own hue and brilliance, creating spectacular scenes of Night in Her many attitudes and postures. When Night moved, so did the Necklace of a Thousand Strands. This created a living, moving mosaic of Night - each image acting and reacting with other images of Herself.

Though this was beautiful and pleasing to Night, it created in Her a loneliness. Loneliness to have companionship, loneliness to have another admire Her great beauty, loneliness to experience love outside Herself.

Not knowing how to create this Other that She longed for, She sought to amuse Herself through movement. She began a stately dance, slow and measured. As She turned in the figures of the Dance, wind was created in Her passing, and in it She visualized a partner, a counterpart.

She sent all Her love and longing into the whirlwind She had created, and a shadowy form began to take shape. She turned and spun ever faster, thinking more upon the shape of Her desire. The form became more solid. It began to take on substance and reality. It was like, yet unlike, Night. She felt drawn to it and it was impelled toward Her.

She gloried in Her creation of the form, and it adored Her great beauty. The Two danced together. The longer They danced, the stronger and brighter did the fierce spirit of longing and love grow between Them, Night and Her Shadow.

Her Shadow became all that Night was not, out of Her longing to be fulfilled, and She was called Day.

Day and Night danced furiously together, and finally, no longer able to keep apart, made love to one another. In Their wild, passionate turnings, the Necklace of a Thousand Strands began to break, a strand at a time. The specks of light went flying off to become the Stars, to swim about the divine couple, in beautiful precise patterns, as if to remain a part of Love's Dance. Thus began the Ages of Loving.

All but one strand broke, and it remains together to this day. It is seen in the sky, brilliant, breath-taking, and awe-inspiring. We call it the Milky Way.

Dawn and Dusk are the sacred times and places where Night and Day merge in love's ecstasy. Keep them holy.In our groups, we generally end the dance after "The Burning Times" finishes with an "Eko Eko..." chorus, and then drop the cords to the ground to send the magic on its way. If you work alone, the ritual can be adapted. Instead of forming a cartwheel, you can weave your cords into a web-like pattern or use knots. It doesn't matter which, as long as you remember and focus on the concept of the links with other Pagans. If Australian readers have problems finding a copy of "The Burning Times," write to us, and we'll try and put you in touch with a supplier. This ritual has now been performed a number of times with Pagans from NSW, ACT, SA, and the USA. It is also being worked in Britain, and a number of events that have happened recently seem to confirm that a very real current is being generated to strengthen Pagan Unity.

Blessing my New Home:
Touch the lintel and touch the wall,
Nothing but blessings here befall!
Bless the candle that stands by itself,
Bless the book on the mantle shelf,
Bless the pillow for the tired head,
Bless the hearth and the light shed.
Friends who tarry here, let them know
A threefold blessing before they go.
Sleep for weariness - peace for sorrow
Faith in yesterday and tomorrow.
Friends who go from here, let them bear
The blessing of hope, wherever they fare.
Lintel and windows, sill and wall,
Nothing but good, this place befall.

A Bowhunter's Prayer to Diana:
Oh Silvery Huntress of the Night!
Diana of the pale moonlight!
Oh Goddess of the Silver Bow
Smile on your humble child, below
Come now to me and be my guest,
And aid me in this hunt...my quest!
In this endeavor, grant success
Grant me patience - grant kindness
Watch over me and guide my steps -
As I walk into the forest's depths.
Protect me from all injury
And close beside me, always be.
Aid me as I track the deer
Through brush and thickets, far and near
When it comes time to draw my bow
Grant me accuracy, here below
Guide my arrows with speed and skill
Grant painless death and swiftest kill
Silvery Huntress, I am your child...
I hunt your forests, free and wild.
Bless this hunt, I ask of thee
Oh Great Diana, hear my plea
Goddess of Wild Ones and the Night!
Bless my table with food tonight!

Spirituality:
"What is 'spirituality'? Does it matter much today?
And what is something 'sacred'? Is it black and white...or grey?"
These were the queries of a youngster, and gave me pause for thought;
And as I rummaged through my mind, I found the words I sought.
"Spirituality is a relationship 'twixt the Universe and you,
And how you behave will manifest, no matter what you do!
It's a friendship with creation - with stones and plants and trees,
With birds and deer and butterflies...and even bumblebees;
It's knowing that the life you have, is found in them, as well;
It's awareness that creation is found in every realm,
And that all of it is sacred and all of it's divine!
That means it's very special - and will be for all time!
The answers to your questions are both black and white, and grey,
As spirituality and sacredness depends on you...each day!"
I pondered well his queries as he slipped out the door,
And wondered if I'd answered well - or if I should say more...
But looking out the window, I saw him smile at me,
And knew that I'd said plenty, as he reached out and hugged a tree!

Creation Mystery, Part II:
The Lord, and the Lady (and the Fool) were lonely. The All was not complete; there was none to keep them company, and laugh with them. There was none to know them, and none to be Their Children.
And the Lady said, "Let us go forth and make Life upon the many worlds, that We may have Children, and a Family of Life within the MultiVerse. And let Us make them in Our image, and love and be loved in return."
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said the Sacred King.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled the Youth.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said the Child.
And the Fool smiled, and said, "If we do this thing, it shall be a wondrous thing indeed, for we shall make a Creature that shall have the Love of the Lady, and the Strength of the Lord, and a Curiosity to match Myself. It shall know Good and Evil, and Light and Darkness, and That which stands between them, and shall be very near and dear to us. It shall be arrogant, and willful, and cruel, but it shall also be kind, and gentle and loving. It shall be all things, and nothing at all."
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said Chaos.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled Trickster.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said Prometheus.
The Fool took up the stuff of stars, that whispers through the MultiVerse, and mixed it with the dry clay of earth, and mixed the substance thereby made with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden, and the birth-waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet it was with the blood of the Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on the lips of the Child.
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said the Crone.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled the Maiden.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said the Mother.
And the Fool smiled, and said, "Then let it be so, for I have asked three times, and three times three, and thus it is and so it ever shall be!"
The Holy Fool bent, and sank to His knees, and She took the wet clay, wet with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden, and the birth-waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet with the blood of the Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on the lips of the Child.
And from that clay He made our Brothers and Sisters in Fur, Feather and Scale, and all the growing things.
And one thing made of that clay was taken up by the Fool, and placed aside.
And the Lady smiled upon Her Lord.
And the Fool turned, and It was Prometheus, and shaped the wet clay thing further.
Side by side, He made them, that none should stand above the other, but that all should walk as equals and partners, in joy and love.
And the Fool turned, and It was Trickster, who shaped us to be curious, and to doubt, and from our doubt and curiosity, to learn, and to laugh.
And the Fool turned, and She was Chaos, and placed a bit of Itself within us, that we may change and grow.
And the Lord smiled upon His Lady.
Man and Woman Prometheus made, and the making and the shaping was as years, and years upon years.
And the Fool began to dance.
And the Lady began to dance.
And the Lord began to dance.
They danced Life into the World, the Lady and the Lord, and the Fool. They danced the moon, and stars, and Sun, and all that there is, they danced into being.
And they danced Death into the World, for we must close the Circle of our Being, and go forth unto newness.
They danced Life and Death, and still They dance, a never-ending, ever-spinning Circle, endlessly spiraling upon itself, and uncoiling to start anew; hand in hand They dance, to a Music They have made, endlessly creating, and endlessly destroying.
Thus it was, and so it is, and evermore shall be so!The night was quiet and peaceful, with only the occasional call of a whippoorwill to break the tranquil silence. The Moon was an iridescent ball of silver perched high in the heavens, illuminating the Earth below. The sky, a lovely shade of midnight blue, was sparsely speckled with the twinkle of stars. I peered out my window, enchanted by the beauty of the night. As my eyes wandered, they came to rest upon the corn field—the corn field that had broken my very heart.

In the beginning, I had worked patiently and diligently tending the soil. I tilled it—turning it over and over, so that the new could surface and the old could rest. I carefully pulled away the weeds and the remnants of the old crop to make the field ready for new planting. I fertilized and nurtured it, smoothed and moistened it. Day after day, I toiled to make it ready. Finally, I plowed it into even rows and lovingly planted it.

Every day, I tended the seed and watched for new sprouts. Tenaciously, I ripped the weeds from Earth that would rob the seeds of the nutrients necessary for their growth. And then one day, I saw it—a single, solitary sprout that had pushed its way through the soil! Within the week, the entire field was covered with a very thin mesh of green, and I felt a joy in my heart that words cannot describe! The hard work, the aching muscles, and the tender care with which I had nurtured the field was not in vain—the Earth which I loved had given birth and was alive in the greening of the seed I had sown.

Daily, I worked in the field, delighting in the growth of the corn—revelling in its freshness—exulting in the part I had played in its birth. The rains came down, drenching the earth and the roots grew deep. The sun shone brightly on the young plants and they grew tall, reaching for the sky. Ears began to form on the stalks, and all was well with the crop.

But then the drought arrived, and the rains came no more. The sun still beamed brightly, and the roots moved deeper and deeper into the Earth in their desperate quest to find water. Alas, there was not a single drop left with which they could quench their thirst. The once luxuriant green leaves began to yellow and wither. The stalks which had stood so proudly against the sky began to shrivel and crack, and the tender ears, so newly born, dried up in death. Yes, the corn which I had helped to birth—that which I had loved so dearly—was gone. Dried up. Dead.

A tear fell from my eye as I stood looking at the field that night, remembering. A gentle breeze rustled through the old and withered stalks as I wiped away the tear. And then...I saw something! Or was it someone? Slowly and silently I crept toward the corn field to take a better look. I felt my heart beating faster and faster, as panic began to consume me. After all, it was nearly midnight and too late for visitors! Whomever was in the field was obviously up to no good, and I wanted them to leave immediately! My legs moved faster and faster—more quickly than I had dreamed they were capable—until I was, indeed, on a dead run! When I reached the old oak tree that shaded the northern edge of the field, I opened my mouth to shout my displeasure at the trespasser; however, I fell silent as my eyes focused on the sight, and my mouth gaped wide.

For there, in the center of the corn field, was a young woman in white—her hair as gold as the maize—glowing in the shimmering iridescence of the moonlight! Questions ravaged my tired brain, as I tried to assess the situation and size up the intruder. Who was She? What was She doing there? Surely She knew She was trespassing—and most certainly She knew that it was illegal! As much as I wished to call out to Her, I was mesmerized by Her very presence and found that I could say nothing. Helplessly, I watched as She moved through the rows of death. She stopped to caress a dry and withered leaf, and then smiling, held it to her cheek. Gently, She reached out and wrapped Her arms about the cracked, brown stalk, hugging it closely to Her breast. She released the stalk and bent down to look at one of the ears—perfectly formed, but shriveled in its deathly demise. Quickly, She snapped the ear from its stalk, tugged away its husk and swiftly moved toward the outside perimeter of the field.

Holding the ear of corn high above Her golden head, She began to dance upon the barren Earth. As if in slow motion, She twirled about the outside edges of the field, as she softly hummed an unfamiliar tune. Round and round the field She danced, picking up momentum as She worked Her way toward the center. Louder and louder She sang, the volume increasing as Her feet flew faster and continued to spiral toward the center. Within the matter of a few seconds, She had become a whirling dervish—dancing with such wild abandon that the kernels of corn were loosed from their cob, flying helter-skelter across the field! She glistened in the moonlight as droplets of perspiration formed upon Her body, and in the frenzy of Her dance, they too, were flung upon the Earth. Her feet and voice reached the ultimate crescendo at the center of the corn field, and She fell upon the ground in total exhaustion.

All was silent. The sounds of the nocturnal creatures had been stilled. All was enveloped in an unnatural hush—as if time itself, had stopped. She lay on the Earth, unbreathing, unmoving, immobile—as still as Death, itself! I stared at Her in horror, the panic which I had forgotten, rushing back into my brain with full force. Was She alright? Good Heavens! Was She dead??

Finally, I gathered my wits about me, found my feet and rushed toward the center of the corn field, where She had fallen in collapse. My heart beating wildly, I reached out to Her—but She was gone! She had disappeared into the very ether! All that was left in Her place was a single corn cob, void of its kernels—the kernels which had flung from their resting place in the midst of the Lady's spiral dance.

The sun was shining hotly on my face as I rubbed my sleepy eyes into total alertness. Where was I? This didn't feel like my bed! What was causing this blinding light? I was soaked to the bone! Just what the hell was happening here? Cautiously, I opened my eyes and surveyed my surroundings. To my dismay, I was lying smack-dab in the middle of the corn field and my head was resting in a rather large mud puddle. Clenched tightly in my fist, like some precious jewel in need of protection, was a solitary corn cob.

I scrambled to my feet and tried in desperation to collect my thoughts. What was I doing here? Had I lost my mind? And then...I remembered! I remembered the cornfield in the moonlight—the Lady and the dance. I also remembered how Her drops of perspiration had dropped to the ground in the frenzy of Her movements. I looked at my feet and the Earth beneath them. Joy and wonder rose in my heart. It had rained! Merciful Heavens! It had rained—the Earth was soaked with moisture—the drought was over!

Gleefully, I ran through the cornfield, feeling my bare toes dig into the wet Earth—the same Earth which had been so cracked and dry and barren just yesterday. I ran in joy. I ran in ecstasy. I ran in sheer celebration of the soil's return to richness—and then, I stopped dead in my tracks. Something was amiss. Something had changed. Something was quite unlike it had been before. Scanning the field, I realized that it was once again covered with delicate green mesh of newly sprouting corn! In awe, I reached down to cradle a newly-formed sprout and as my fingers touched the verdant green leaf, a feminine voice began to speak:

"You were born of me! You are my child and at death you shall return to me. Fear not of death, dear one, for within its realm I shall bring you new life! Just as the corn lives again—so shall it be with you! For all that falls shall rise again, and that which dies shall be blessed with the gift of rebirth—the gift of My love!"The Priestess held up the pomegranate, saying, "Behold the pomegranate, fruit of Life." She then plunged the athame into the pomegranate, splitting it open to display the seeds. "Whose seeds lie in the dormancy of Death!" she declared. The Priestess ate one of the seeds, saying, "I taste the seeds of Death." The pomegranate was then passed hand to hand through the participants of the ritual, each eating a seed and saying to the next person, "Taste the seeds of Death."

The Priestess then held up the apple, saying, "Behold the apple: fruit of wisdom, fruit of Death." She cut the apple crosswise, revealing the inner pentagram, and said, "Whose symbolism rewards us with life eternal! Behold the five-fold star - the promise of rebirth!" The fruit and wine were consecrated. Each person tasted the apple and sipped the wine, saying to the next person, "Taste the fruit of rebirth and sip from the cup of wine of Life."

After the libation, the Priestess presented each member of the group with a small pot of earth, planted with three seeds. She explained that this is the season of the seed - a time of dormancy and regeneration for growth. As the seeds rest in the earth, they should also take time to rest and re-evaluate their lives, metaphorically planting only those values which will enrich and enhance their growth within the Divine Self. She instructed them to name the seeds within their pots with three values they wished to incorporate into their lives, knowing that as the seeds sprout with new life, their lives will be new as well.

After the presentation, all joined hands and held them skyward. The Priestess said, "Thus is the Circle of Rebirth. All pass from this life through the great god, Pan. But through My love, you are all reborn in the cycles of nature - through the Cosmic Plan. In living we die - in dying we live. The fruit is first seed, yet seed comes from the fruit. In the mystery of life and death and rebirth, the Circle turns ever, and I am its root."

All responded, "The Sun conceived in Darkness, cold. In the Shadow of Death, a Life unfolds. A shred of Light begins to burn. From Death comes Life - the Circle turns."

The Quarters were dismissed, and the Circle was dissolved. The Priestess concluded, "The rite is ended." All said, "Merry meet and merry part and merry meet again!" An outdoor libation to the Lord and Lady, and the spirits of the dead, followed.The Crone handed the chalice to the High Priestess and wrapped her cloak around her, then sat down. The High Priest and High Priestess spiraled back out to the Circle. The High Priest declared that a man is not greater than a woman, and the High Priestess echoed that a woman is not greater than a man. They continued, stating that what one lacks, the other can provide. The athame represents the male, and the cup represents the female. When conjoined, they become one in truth, symbolizing the greatest magic in the world: love.

The High Priestess blessed the cakes, stating that death is not the end of life but the beginning of the cycle of rebirth. As grain is touched by death's scythe and passes through fire to be reborn as bread, so are we reborn, passing through death into the next life. The High Priest drew an invoking pentagram over the cakes with the athame, and both the High Priest and High Priestess declared that as the Earth gives its life to strengthen us, so shall we, in death, strengthen the Earth, for life and death together are the cycle of rebirth.

The cakes and wine were shared among the participants, each taking a piece and passing the basket and chalice around the Circle. They chanted about coming from the Goddess and returning to Her, and from the Horned One, ascending to the heavens. The chant evolved into others, such as the Isis Astarte chant, as the energy built up.

When the energy reached its peak, the High Priestess called a halt by raising her arms and dropping them to her sides. She reminded everyone to take the energy raised by their sisters and brothers and put it into their pledges, emphasizing that they are not alone. The High Priestess and High Priest thanked the spirits and deities, bidding them hail and farewell.

The spirits of the North, West, South, and East were dismissed, each representing different elements and aspects of their ancestors. The High Priest drew power back into the blade of the sword/athame and earthed the power. The High Priest, High Priestess, Harper, Grey Man, and Crone formed a circle, and the next five lines were spoken from person to person to form a pentagram. They declared that the Circle is open but not forgotten, unbroken, and free, with nothing ever forgotten.

The larger Circle joined in singing "Amazing Grace," with lines adapted to reflect their beliefs. The High Priestess concluded with "Blessed Be."The Board of Directors has the authority to establish local Nests or Subsidiary Organizations under conditions determined by the Board.

Amendments to the Bylaws can be made by the Board of Directors at the Annual meeting.The evolution of life on Earth is moving towards a point of actualization where the entire planet will share a single vast global consciousness. Humanity is instrumental in this evolution. As humans can disrupt entire ecosystems, it is our responsibility to prevent such disruptions. We are not anti-technology or science; we recognize that advances in fields like ecology, geology, astronomy, psychology, archaeology, cybernetics, astrophysics, communications, and bio-renaissance technology can be positively evolutionary and harmonious with planetary consciousness. We oppose the senseless use of industrial technology that harms the ecosystem, often justified by the Biblical injunction that Man is to have "dominion over the Earth." We see our role not as dominion but as responsible stewardship. We agree with Erich Fromm that the purpose of life is "to become what we potentially are," and we identify with the concepts of human self-actualization by Abraham Maslow and found in transpersonal psychology and ethics. Rejecting predestination and inherent sin, we affirm the ultimate freedom and responsibility appropriate to conscious entities, expressed in the phrase "Thou Art God/dess," from Robert Heinlein's novel, 'Stranger in a Strange Land.' This implies that each of us must define our own specific purpose, with no excuse or shelter from the responsibility of total freedom. Recognizing that all life on Earth comprises a single vast living entity, conceptualized as feminine, we align with our Pagan ancestors who worshipped The Goddess: Mother Earth, Mother Nature. We affirm the pantheistic conceptualization of immanent divinity inherent in all living entities, defining divinity as the highest level of aware consciousness accessible to each being, manifesting in self-actualization. Thus, "Thou Art God/dess" applies equally to a person, a tree, a grasshopper, or a planet. As Neo-Pagans, we focus on life after birth rather than life after death. We have no dogmas of immortality, considering that beliefs about an afterlife may shape one's experience of it. We view death as necessary for new life, returning the dead to the Earth to be recycled into other life forms. Our ecological responsibility is to return to the Earth what we have taken. We are concerned with improving the quality of life and agree with population ecologists that its quantity must be reduced. We support birth control measures, including the legalization of abortion, fearing that if humanity does not limit its numbers, Nature will do it by increasing deaths. 

WHERE WE'RE GOING: The word 'Religion' means "re-linking." The Church of All Worlds is committed to reintegrating people with themselves, their fellow humans, and living Nature. We create no artificial demarcations between the sacred and the secular, recognizing that religion must be an entire way of life. We aim to develop an organic, vitalistic philosophy of life and its expression in an organic culture. The Church of All Worlds offers assistance through personal expansion programs and remains open-minded to new ideas, interests, and goals. We advocate involvement in all aspects of the emerging Gaian culture, from religious service and mythology to family relations, education, ecology, psychic development, space travel, sensuality, sexuality, intentional communities, planetary government, and world peace. We are engaged in the eclectic reconstruction of ancient Nature religions, combining archetypes of many cultures with other mystic and spiritual disciplines. We are not just trying to recreate a Paradise Lost; we are actively working to actualize a visionary future. With roots deep in the Earth and branches reaching towards the stars, we create myths of both a Golden Age long past and one yet to come. We consider every activity to be essentially religious, from recycling to composting, growing organic vegetables, practicing birth control, using biodegradable products, boycotting tuna, training, studying, protecting animals, and celebrating the seasons. The essence of our religion is in living it.

WHERE WE CAME FROM: The Church of All Worlds traces its history back to 1962, when Tim Zell and Lance Christie formed a "water brotherhood" called "Atl" at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. The group later operated as the "Atlan Foundation" at the University of Oklahoma. In 1968, the Church of All Worlds was incorporated in St. Louis, becoming the first Neo-Pagan/Earth Religion to obtain federal recognition. The periodical "Green Egg" began publication in 1968, becoming significant in the Pagan movement during the 1970s. The Church took inspiration from Robert Heinlein's 1961 science fiction novel, 'Stranger in a Strange Land,' where the "Church of All Worlds" was formed by the character Michael Valentine Smith. The real-life Church's theology is a form of pantheism focusing on immanent divinity. The "Gaia Thesis," developed by Tim Zell, posits that the planet is a single living organism, Mother Earth (Gaia). The Church recognizes Gaia, Pan, and other nature spirits as the Divine Pantheon and became a forerunner of the Deep Ecology movement. The Church maintains an egalitarian structure, recognizing and ordaining women to the priesthood and holding important policy-making positions. The Church is not a secret or members-only organization and welcomes participation from all who are sincerely interested, regardless of race, sex, national or cultural origins, or sexual preference. Our creed states: "The Church of All Worlds is dedicated to the celebration of life, the maximum actualization of human potential, and the realization of ultimate individual freedom and personal responsibility in harmonious eco-psychic relationship with the total Biosphere of Holy Mother Earth." Worship involves weekly or monthly meetings, usually in members' homes, with a Circle where members share their creativity. A chalice of water is shared around the Circle. Other events are celebrated at the Church retreat sanctuary, "Annwfn," in Northern California. The land has several hand-built buildings, including a two-story temple, a garden, an orchard, and a small pond. The Church holds various festivals, handfastings, vision quests, rites of passage, workshops, retreats, work parties, summer camps, and staff meetings. Congregations are called nests, and several exist worldwide. The Church has founded several subsidiary branch orders, including NEMETON (publishing arm), FOREVER FORESTS (ecology branch), ECOSOPHICAL RESEARCH ASSN (research and exploration), LIFEWAYS (teaching order), and PEACEFUL ORDER OF MOTHER EARTH (dedicated to children and child nurturing).

More recently, it has been taken up in the Pagan and other alternative communities such as the SCA as a favorite for years. It's a form of wine made with honey instead of grape juice. Mead is most often associated with the Vikings and in the Pagan community with modern-day Norse Paganism or Asatru. Mead is an important part of the Asatru religion and has a place in both of the major Norse rituals: the blot and the sumble. The sumble is a drinking ritual where stories, oaths, and poetry are shared, and mead's function here is obvious. In this day and age, mead is even more important to the blot or sacrifice ritual. The blot is actually quite simple. A God or Goddess is called upon, and a sacrifice is poured in their honor. In ancient times, this was most often an animal sacrifice, and blood was poured out onto the ground or altar. Today, an alcoholic beverage of some kind is the usual sacrifice. This is not only an adjustment to modern feelings about animal sacrifice but is appropriate from an esoteric point of view as well. In ancient times, the Norsemen were primarily farmers, and an animal would have been a product that they had raised. Also, sacrifices were not a wasting of the animal, merely given to the Gods and left to rot, but were usually feasts where the Gods got their portion and the humans their own. Today, mead making has been a frenzied activity among Norse Pagans, and it is most appropriate that something be sacrificed to the Gods which has been made by your own hands in a sacred manner. Mead fits the bill. It has immediate links to our farming ancestors, but it can be easily made from household items in even a small apartment. While we really don’t know a great deal about how the ancients viewed mead, other than as an intoxicant, we do have a few clues. One interesting item to start with is that mead was apparently sometimes strained through rye, which contains the hallucinogenic chemical ergot. This may offer some insights into Seidhr, a Nordic shamanic practice, and the frenzy of the berserkers. Another interesting item is that Frey, a God of farming and harvest, was said to have two close companions, Bygvir and Beyla. Bygvir was the spirit of the barley and Beyla of the honey, both important Gods to brewers and appropriate companions for the God of fertility. Finally, we have a few myths involving mead directly. Mead was known as Kvasir’s blood, and its primary association was with wisdom. Kvasir was a being who was the wisest in all the universe, but he was killed, and a mead created out of his blood that, when drank, brought the drinker wisdom. Aegir, a God of the Sea, was held to be the patron of brewing and the finest of mead and ale for the Gods to drink in Valhalla. Odin is said to never eat but to exist purely on mead, just as the Greek Gods had their nectar. Even if it were not for any mythological importance, mead is of interest to the modern brewer because it is easy to produce and delicious. One merely introduces yeast to the sugary liquid, and the yeast converts the natural sugars into alcohol. After all the sugar is converted, the yeast dies off, and the wine can be bottled. However, this is not always as easy as it sounds. The largest problem in brewing is keeping inappropriate yeasts out of the drink. While the correct wine (or beer) yeasts eat sugar and excrete alcohol, other yeasts produce vinegar instead. Because of this, it is absolutely vital to keep all brewing equipment absolutely sterile. This is the most important thing you can do in brewing. All the great equipment purchased at your wine-making shop and the finest ingredients cannot beat a glass jar filled with welfare honey if the former is contaminated and the latter sterile. There are two major ways to sterilize your materials: one is a commercial sanitizer found in wine-making shops. Follow label directions, and you’re all set. The other is to make a solution of 25% bleach and rinse very thoroughly. Let’s make some cheap and easy mead. You’ll need a large pot, a one-gallon vinegar or cider bottle, a 4' or 5' length of plastic tubing (try airline tubing from a pet shop), a balloon or non-lubricated condom, a package of wine yeast (not bread yeast), wine bottles, corks, a corking device, and 2 1/2 pounds of honey. First, you need to prepare the mixture that will be fermented. Take your pot and add the honey and enough water to finish filling up the one-gallon bottle. Bring these to a boil slowly. If you don’t want scum in your mead and it forms on the top, skim it off. You don’t need to boil it for any length of time; you just need to bring it up to this temperature. Boiling for a while will release a lot of scum and additives which you can get rid of right now, and it will also allow the mead to age more quickly. However, some of this scum, as I’ve called it, is made up of those very things which can create flavor nuances. I don’t boil mine. When you decide it’s done, let it cool long enough so it won’t melt the plastic tubing, then siphon the mead into the gallon jug, cap, and let cool overnight. The gallon jug is your primary fermenter. Did you sterilize the pot? The bottle? The cap? The plastic tubing? No! Pour it out and start again. Yes, I am serious. Once the mixture is cooled to room temperature, you will need to pitch the yeast. Get a small cup half full with warm, but not hot, water and add the yeast. Let it sit for about ten minutes and absorb water and liven up, then pour it into your gallon jug and mix it in. As of now, your honey and water mixture is now being converted into mead. However, this will take about two weeks, perhaps more, to complete. During this time, the mead mixture will bubble and foam, and this is what the balloon is for. Cover the top of the bottle with the balloon, and about an hour later, when the balloon has started to inflate but has not become too stretched, poke a few holes in it with a pin. This balloon takes the place of a fermentation lock and allows the gas to escape while not allowing air in, thus keeping the fermentation bottle sterile. The holes may become clogged with foam, and you may need to poke a few more. Just remember the purpose of this and use your common sense. I’ve accomplished this with plastic wrap and a rubber band, but I wouldn’t advise others to try unless you’re fond of unmet expectations. About two weeks from this point, the balloon will cease to be greatly inflated and will eventually go limp. When it has been completely limp for a few days and the mead is clear rather than cloudy, fermentation is over. At this point, sanitize your wine bottles and plastic tubing and bottle the mead. Be careful not to get the yeast into the bottles as it’s not exactly tasty stuff. I stop about an inch before the bottom of the primary fermenter and we siphon off the last inch into cups and toast the new mead. My mead has been very tasty at this point; other people describe theirs as tasting like paint thinner. In any case, you may not mind a little yeast in your cup now, but don’t inflict it on yourself in the future by bottling it. Wait two to six months and then enjoy. Since the above recipe has no additives which would hasten aging, it may take a while for it to become truly fine mead, perhaps years. There are a lot of chemical additives that one can use to improve the flavor and process. The most common and important addition is a teaspoon of yeast energizer or yeast nutrient. Others include grape tannin (1/4 teaspoon), malic acid (2 or 3 teaspoons), tartaric acid (1 to 2 teaspoons). I recommend all of these chemical additives in your first batch, but if you can’t find them, you can make do with natural ingredients or nothing at all. One can also add slices of fruit, raisins, or berries for flavor and in place of grape tannin. One recipe I know of adds some apple jelly. A few lemon peels will substitute for malic acid, and a spoonful of strong tea will replace tartaric acid. Hops are a common additive and will give the mead a bit of a bitterness to offset the sweetness of the honey. The more bizarre ingredient I have heard of was Szechuan peppers; use your imagination. All of the above additives should be made to the honey and water mix when it is boiled. Depending on the ingredient, some, such as fruit, may have to be boiled in this mixture for a while to break them down. Obviously, hunks of fruit should be strained out after the boiling. Also, all the above ingredients are based on 1 gallon of mead; adjust appropriately with the exception of the yeast itself, one package of which will do for anywhere between 1 and 5 gallons. Another semi-useful item is sulfite tablets which can be added to the mead mixture a day before bottling. This will kill all remaining yeast and will assure that you are not contaminated by vinegar yeast after bottling or worse, that the fermentation process does not continue in the bottle, causing it to explode or pop its cork. I don’t use sulfite, and I’ve heard negative comments about a sulfurous aftertaste. It’s probably the better part of valor to simply wait a while longer and make sure the fermentation process is truly ended. The above instructions also assume you are not interested in spending a great deal of money on equipment. The only things you really must obtain from a wine-making store are the yeast, the corks, and the corker. If you are willing to spend $50 to $100 more, you can improve your chances of making a good mead by purchasing equipment made for the purpose. A balloon works, but it is a poor substitute for a proper fermentation lock that is custom fit to a vat built for the purpose. Likewise, there are many other devices which will be useful.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

Previous Content: In our groups, we generally end the dance after "The Burning Times" finishes with an "Eko Eko..." chorus, and then drop the cords to the ground to send the magic on its way. If you work alone, the ritual can be adapted. Instead of forming a cartwheel, you can weave your cords into a web-like pattern or use knots. It doesn't matter which, as long as you remember and focus on the concept of the links with other Pagans. If Australian readers have problems finding a copy of "The Burning Times," write to us, and we'll try and put you in touch with a supplier. This ritual has now been performed a number of times with Pagans from NSW, ACT, SA, and the USA. It is also being worked in Britain, and a number of events that have happened recently seem to confirm that a very real current is being generated to strengthen Pagan Unity.

Blessing my New Home:
Touch the lintel and touch the wall,
Nothing but blessings here befall!
Bless the candle that stands by itself,
Bless the book on the mantle shelf,
Bless the pillow for the tired head,
Bless the hearth and the light shed.
Friends who tarry here, let them know
A threefold blessing before they go.
Sleep for weariness - peace for sorrow
Faith in yesterday and tomorrow.
Friends who go from here, let them bear
The blessing of hope, wherever they fare.
Lintel and windows, sill and wall,
Nothing but good, this place befall.

A Bowhunter's Prayer to Diana:
Oh Silvery Huntress of the Night!
Diana of the pale moonlight!
Oh Goddess of the Silver Bow
Smile on your humble child, below
Come now to me and be my guest,
And aid me in this hunt...my quest!
In this endeavor, grant success
Grant me patience - grant kindness
Watch over me and guide my steps -
As I walk into the forest's depths.
Protect me from all injury
And close beside me, always be.
Aid me as I track the deer
Through brush and thickets, far and near
When it comes time to draw my bow
Grant me accuracy, here below
Guide my arrows with speed and skill
Grant painless death and swiftest kill
Silvery Huntress, I am your child...
I hunt your forests, free and wild.
Bless this hunt, I ask of thee
Oh Great Diana, hear my plea
Goddess of Wild Ones and the Night!
Bless my table with food tonight!

Spirituality:
"What is 'spirituality'? Does it matter much today?
And what is something 'sacred'? Is it black and white...or grey?"
These were the queries of a youngster, and gave me pause for thought;
And as I rummaged through my mind, I found the words I sought.
"Spirituality is a relationship 'twixt the Universe and you,
And how you behave will manifest, no matter what you do!
It's a friendship with creation - with stones and plants and trees,
With birds and deer and butterflies...and even bumblebees;
It's knowing that the life you have, is found in them, as well;
It's awareness that creation is found in every realm,
And that all of it is sacred and all of it's divine!
That means it's very special - and will be for all time!
The answers to your questions are both black and white, and grey,
As spirituality and sacredness depends on you...each day!"
I pondered well his queries as he slipped out the door,
And wondered if I'd answered well - or if I should say more...
But looking out the window, I saw him smile at me,
And knew that I'd said plenty, as he reached out and hugged a tree!

Creation Mystery, Part II:
The Lord, and the Lady (and the Fool) were lonely. The All was not complete; there was none to keep them company, and laugh with them. There was none to know them, and none to be Their Children.
And the Lady said, "Let us go forth and make Life upon the many worlds, that We may have Children, and a Family of Life within the MultiVerse. And let Us make them in Our image, and love and be loved in return."
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said the Sacred King.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled the Youth.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said the Child.
And the Fool smiled, and said, "If we do this thing, it shall be a wondrous thing indeed, for we shall make a Creature that shall have the Love of the Lady, and the Strength of the Lord, and a Curiosity to match Myself. It shall know Good and Evil, and Light and Darkness, and That which stands between them, and shall be very near and dear to us. It shall be arrogant, and willful, and cruel, but it shall also be kind, and gentle and loving. It shall be all things, and nothing at all."
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said Chaos.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled Trickster.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said Prometheus.
The Fool took up the stuff of stars, that whispers through the MultiVerse, and mixed it with the dry clay of earth, and mixed the substance thereby made with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden, and the birth-waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet it was with the blood of the Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on the lips of the Child.
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said the Crone.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled the Maiden.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said the Mother.
And the Fool smiled, and said, "Then let it be so, for I have asked three times, and three times three, and thus it is and so it ever shall be!"
The Holy Fool bent, and sank to His knees, and She took the wet clay, wet with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden, and the birth-waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet with the blood of the Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on the lips of the Child.
And from that clay He made our Brothers and Sisters in Fur, Feather and Scale, and all the growing things.
And one thing made of that clay was taken up by the Fool, and placed aside.
And the Lady smiled upon Her Lord.
And the Fool turned, and It was Prometheus, and shaped the wet clay thing further.
Side by side, He made them, that none should stand above the other, but that all should walk as equals and partners, in joy and love.
And the Fool turned, and It was Trickster, who shaped us to be curious, and to doubt, and from our doubt and curiosity, to learn, and to laugh.
And the Fool turned, and She was Chaos, and placed a bit of Itself within us, that we may change and grow.
And the Lord smiled upon His Lady.
Man and Woman Prometheus made, and the making and the shaping was as years, and years upon years.
And the Fool began to dance.
And the Lady began to dance.
And the Lord began to dance.
They danced Life into the World, the Lady and the Lord, and the Fool. They danced the moon, and stars, and Sun, and all that there is, they danced into being.
And they danced Death into the World, for we must close the Circle of our Being, and go forth unto newness.
They danced Life and Death, and still They dance, a never-ending, ever-spinning Circle, endlessly spiraling upon itself, and uncoiling to start anew; hand in hand They dance, to a Music They have made, endlessly creating, and endlessly destroying.
Thus it was, and so it is, and evermore shall be so!

FAIRIES LOVE SONG -Anonymous

Why should I sit and sigh Broo and bracken, broo and bracken Why should I sit and sigh All alone and weary When I see the plover rising Or the curlew wheeling It's then I'll court my mortal lover Back to me is stealing When the moon begins her waning I sit by the water Where a man born of the sunlight Loved the Faerie's daughter Oh, but there is something wanting O but I am weary Coming blithe, now bonny treads he O'er the knolls to cheer me

THE BARD'S SONG -W.J.Bethancourt III (c) copyright 1990 W.J.Bethancourt III (Tune: "Dublin City")

As I walked out one quiet evening At the hour of twelve at night Who should I meet but a fair young maiden Combin' her hair by candle light; Lassie, I have come a-courtin' Your kind favours for to win And if you'd heed my petition I would be your Paladin...

(CHORUS) Gather roses in the Springtime Gather roses while ye may, Time is passing; roses wither; Winter comes; we're here -today-.

Have you seen the dew a-formin' On the grass at early morn? Have you seen the forest quiet, Or a stag that's barely born? Have you seen the dawn a-breakin' O'er the Western Ocean's tide? Have you felt my heart a-beatin' When it's held close to your side?

I can give no gold or silver, I can give no fields of land, I can give no servants brisk To wait on you both foot and hand; I can give you wide roads callin' Wind and Rain, and Moon and Sun, Songs to sing, and love and laughter, Dresses made of plain home-spun.

Come dance with me upon the greensward in the moonlight, in the Spring. Dance with me within the forest Dance with me within the ring! Earth below us, stars above us, Fire and water by our side, Dance with me within the moonlight, Dance with me, and be my Bride!

ALL THRU THE NIGHT -Traditional

While the Moon her watch is keeping all thru the night While the weary world is sleeping all thru the night O'er thy spirit gently stealing, Visions of delight revealing Breathes a pure and holy feeling all thru the night

Though this Bard must roam full lonely My true harp shall sing praise only Love's soft dream, alas, is over Yet my strains of love shall hover Near the Presence of my Lover

Hark! A solemn bell is ringing Thou, my King are heavenward winging Earthly dust from off Thee shaken Soul immortal shalt thou waken With thy last, dim journey taken

Neath this Stone my King is sleeping Stars around Him softly sweeping Once and Future King preserving Britain's Saviour there reserving All around him Stars observing all thru the night

note: The last verse is phonetic Welsh. "ll" is pronounced by putting the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, and saying "h" and "l" at the same time...sort of. "ch" is pronounced as German.

TWO MAGICIANS (Child #44) recorded by Steeleye Span "Below the Salt"

She looked out of the window, as white as any milk He looked in at the window, as black as any silk

(Chorus): Hello, hello, hello, hello you coal black smith You have done me no harm! You never shall have my maidenhead That I have kept so long! I'd rather die a maid, aye, and then she said, And be buried all in my grave, Than to have such a nasty, husky, dusky, fusty, musty coal black smith! A maiden I will die!

She became a duck, a duck all in the stream And he became a waterdog, and fetched her back again

She became a star, a star all in the night And he became a thundercloud and muffled her out of sight

She became a rose, a rose all in the wood And he became a bumblebee and kissed her where she stood

She became a nun, a nun all dressed in white And he became a chantry priest to pray for her by night

She became a trout, a trout all in the brook And he became a feathered fly, and catched her with his hook

She became a quilt, a quilt all on her bed And he became a coverlet, and gained her maidenhead!

note: This has MANY variants. See Robert Graves' "The White Goddess" pg. 401!

JOHN BARLEYCORN

There were three men come out of the West Their fortunes for to try, And these three men made a solemn vow: John Barleycorn should die! John Barleycorn should die! (nb: 4th line of each verse is sung twice)

They plowed, they sowed, they harrowed him in, Threw clods upon his head, And these three men made a solemn vow: John Barleycorn was dead!

CHORUS: Fa la la la, it's a lovely day! Sing fa la la lay oh! Fa la la la, it's a lovely day! Sing fa la la lay oh!

They let him lie for a very long time 'Til the rain from Heaven did fall, Then Little Sir John sprung up his head, And so amazed them all!

They let him stand 'til Midsummer tide, 'Til he grew both pale and wan, Then Little Sir John he grew a long beard, And so became a man!

They hired men with the sythes so sharp To cut him off at the knee They rolled him and tied him about the waist, And used him barbarously!

They hired men with the sharp pitchforks To pierce him to the heart, And the loader he served him worse than that, For he tied him in a cart!

They wheeled him around and around the field, 'Til they came to a barn, And there they made a solemn mow Of poor John Barleycorn,

They hired men with the crab-tree sticks To strip him skin from bone And the Miller he served him worse than that: For he ground him between two stones!

They have wheeled him here and wheeled him there And wheeled him to a barn, And they have served him worse than that They have bunged him in a vat!

John Barleycorn (cont.)

They have worked their will on John Barleycorn But he lived to tell the tale; For they pour him out of an old brown jug, And they call him home-brewed ale!

Here's Little Sir John in a nut-brown bowl, And brandy in a glass! And Little Sir John in the nut-brown bowl Proved the stronger man at last!

For the huntsman he can't hunt the fox Nor loudly blow his horn, And the tinker can't mend kettles nor pots Without John Barleycorn! (Note: sing the chorus after every other verse or so. Encourage the group to join the song)

THE FALSE KNIGHT UPON THE ROAD (Child #3) -recorded by Steeleye Span

"Oh where are you going to?" said the False Knight upon the road "Oh I'm going to my school." said the wee boy and still he stood "What is that upon your back?" said the False Knight upon the road "Ah weel, it is my books!" said the wee boy and still he stood

Oh, what have you got there? I wish you was on the sands. I have got my bread and cheese! Yes, and a good staff in my hands! Oh won't you give me some? I wish you was on the sea. No, ne'r a bite or crumb! And a good ship under me! And the ship to sink. An inch away from shore! I think I hear a bell. And it rings you straight to Hell!

NOTTAMUN TOWN -Traditional

In Nottamun Town, in Nottamun Town Not a soul would look up not a soul would look down Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down To show me the way to fair Nottamun Town

I bought me a horse t'was called a grey mare Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back Weren't a hair upon her that was not coal black

She stood so still threw me to the dirt She tore at my hide, she bruised my shirt From saddle to stirrup I mounted again and on my ten toes I rode over the plain

When I got there no one did I see they all stood around me just looking at me i called for a cup to drive gladness away And stifle the dust for it rained the whole day

And the King and the Queen and the company more Came a riding behind and a walking before Come a stark naked drummer beating a drum With his hands in his bosom came marching along

Sat down on a hard hot cold frozen stone Ten thousand stood round me but I was alone Took my heart in my hand to keep myself warm Ten thousand was drowned that never was born

CAMBRIAN DREAM -Gwydion PenDerwyn copyright probably to Nemeton

In the mountains ofBrown Jasper, because of the beautiful variations in coloring, is a type of Chalcedony. It is closely related to Quartz, with the chemistry of SiO2. The color variations are from trace amounts of other minerals, usually iron and aluminum. The hardness is 7.

ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in chemical sedimentary rocks.

OCCURRENCE: Montana, Utah, and Wyoming are prolific locations for Brown Jasper in the U.S. In addition, fine specimens have come from Brazil, Uruguay, and Egypt. Other colors and forms of Jasper are abundant in California, Texas, and Arkansas.

NAME: The name Chalcedony is from Chalcedon, an ancient Greek city of Asia Minor.

LEGEND and LORE: Beautiful Jasper, with light and dark brown markings, was referred to as "Egyptian Marble." Various Native American tribes used Jasper as a rubbing stone and some called it "the rain bringer."

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Brown Jasper is balancing and grounding. This stone, carved into an arrowhead, is worn to attract luck. It is a good stone to use after completing a ritual to help you regain your center and become grounded.

HEALING: Jasper is stabilizing. It will help to reduce insecurity, fear, and guilt.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use a piece of Montana Picture Jasper, which is mostly brown and tan with a slight bit of sky or navy blue, as a strong grounding stone for those who have an excess of energy at the Splenic Chakra. I've also used the stone as a basis for a "journey"... The stone looks like a scene of the Rocky Mountains. Finally, I've used Picture Jasper as a psychological tool: I will ask someone who is "looking for an answer" to gaze into the stone and describe all the symbols they see. Then I work with the client to form the "symbols" into some sort of answer.

NOTES: Agate, Jasper, Flint, Sardonyx, and Onyx are all forms of Chalcedony. In addition, particular colors of Chalcedony have specific names, such as Heliotrope, Bloodstone, Chrysoprase, and Moss Agate.The seasonal cycle follows the agricultural and solar cycle of the year, with eight major festivals. The first, and possibly the most important, is Samhain, commonly known as Halloween, marking the end of one agricultural year and the beginning of the next. It is also a festival of the dead, reflecting on the memories of lost loved ones and gaining insights from their lives. The mid-Winter Solstice, Yule, celebrates the rebirth of the Sun. Imbolc, or Candlemas, represents the first stirring of Spring. The Spring Equinox, associated with Easter, marks the earth coming back to life. Beltane, without a Christian counterpart, is known for its overtly sexual nature. The Summer Solstice represents the Sun at its height. Lugnassadh, or Lammas, starts the harvest, and the Autumn Equinox is the harvest festival. Rituals and ceremonies vary but often reflect the natural world and the roles of gods and goddesses. Magic in Witchcraft is seen as a form of prayer, seeking the assistance of a particular deity. The concept of white and black magic is rejected; instead, magic is seen as a neutral force, with its use determined by the individual's intentions. The Craft emphasizes the importance of considering the implications of magical acts, guided by the ethic "An it harm none, do what thou will" and the "Law of Threefold Return," which suggests that the effects of one's actions will return threefold. The idea of Satanic child abuse is dismissed as a myth created by extremists. The Craft values individual responsibility and the sacredness of children. The future goal is to coexist peacefully with other religions, respecting each other's right to practice their beliefs. The ultimate aim is a world that can live in peace, with each religion contributing to the greater good. The document emphasizes the importance of not imposing one's religious will on others and the desire to work towards a better world.The desires of the body and ego are often impulsive and destructive. The Church of Satan (COS) found itself in an awkward position, leading to its crisis and demise in 1975. The Temple of Set aimed to preserve individualism while adding the evolutionary "higher self" aspirations of Aleister Crowley's pre-OTO philosophy of Thelema. Glorification of the ego is not enough; it is the complete psyche, the entire Self or soul, which must be recognized, appreciated, and actualized. Dogma, including fixed ideology in any form, is repugnant to Setians. They strive for an atmosphere of "best possible premises," always subject to constructive, intelligent examination and criticism. Foolish, pretentious, or destructive egotism under the guise of exploration is neither respected nor endured.

Regretfully, some individuals still view "Satanism" as a simple-minded synthesis of Christian propaganda and Hollywood horror movies. The Temple of Set enjoys the colorful legacy of the Black Arts and uses historical Satanic imagery for artistic stimulation and pleasure. However, they do not find any interest or activity that an enlightened, mature intellect would regard as undignified, sadistic, criminal, or depraved to be desirable or essential to their work. The Temple of Set is an evolutionary product of human experience, including the magical and philosophical work of many occult individuals who preceded them. In examining the secret and suppressed corners of history for valuable and useful material, the Temple insists upon ethical presentation and use of such discoveries. All Setians are expected to display a high measure of maturity and common sense in this area. They reject absolutely wanton cruelty and harm to others, particularly regarding animals.

The Temple of Set evaluates conventional religions as erroneous in principle and feels no need to concern itself with their activities unless they intrude upon their affairs. Any further questions or comments are welcome.In our groups, we generally end the dance after "The Burning Times" finishes with an "Eko Eko..." chorus, and then drop the cords to the ground to send the magic on its way. If you work alone, the ritual can be adapted. Instead of forming a cartwheel, you can weave your cords into a web-like pattern or use knots. It doesn't matter which, as long as you remember and focus on the concept of the links with other Pagans. If Australian readers have problems finding a copy of "The Burning Times," write to us, and we'll try and put you in touch with a supplier. This ritual has now been performed a number of times with Pagans from NSW, ACT, SA, and the USA. It is also being worked in Britain, and a number of events that have happened recently seem to confirm that a very real current is being generated to strengthen Pagan Unity.

Blessing my New Home:
Touch the lintel and touch the wall,
Nothing but blessings here befall!
Bless the candle that stands by itself,
Bless the book on the mantle shelf,
Bless the pillow for the tired head,
Bless the hearth and the light shed.
Friends who tarry here, let them know
A threefold blessing before they go.
Sleep for weariness - peace for sorrow
Faith in yesterday and tomorrow.
Friends who go from here, let them bear
The blessing of hope, wherever they fare.
Lintel and windows, sill and wall,
Nothing but good, this place befall.

A Bowhunter's Prayer to Diana:
Oh Silvery Huntress of the Night!
Diana of the pale moonlight!
Oh Goddess of the Silver Bow
Smile on your humble child, below
Come now to me and be my guest,
And aid me in this hunt...my quest!
In this endeavor, grant success
Grant me patience - grant kindness
Watch over me and guide my steps -
As I walk into the forest's depths.
Protect me from all injury
And close beside me, always be.
Aid me as I track the deer
Through brush and thickets, far and near
When it comes time to draw my bow
Grant me accuracy, here below
Guide my arrows with speed and skill
Grant painless death and swiftest kill
Silvery Huntress, I am your child...
I hunt your forests, free and wild.
Bless this hunt, I ask of thee
Oh Great Diana, hear my plea
Goddess of Wild Ones and the Night!
Bless my table with food tonight!

Spirituality:
"What is 'spirituality'? Does it matter much today?
And what is something 'sacred'? Is it black and white...or grey?"
These were the queries of a youngster, and gave me pause for thought;
And as I rummaged through my mind, I found the words I sought.
"Spirituality is a relationship 'twixt the Universe and you,
And how you behave will manifest, no matter what you do!
It's a friendship with creation - with stones and plants and trees,
With birds and deer and butterflies...and even bumblebees;
It's knowing that the life you have, is found in them, as well;
It's awareness that creation is found in every realm,
And that all of it is sacred and all of it's divine!
That means it's very special - and will be for all time!
The answers to your questions are both black and white, and grey,
As spirituality and sacredness depends on you...each day!"
I pondered well his queries as he slipped out the door,
And wondered if I'd answered well - or if I should say more...
But looking out the window, I saw him smile at me,
And knew that I'd said plenty, as he reached out and hugged a tree!

Creation Mystery, Part II:
The Lord, and the Lady (and the Fool) were lonely. The All was not complete; there was none to keep them company, and laugh with them. There was none to know them, and none to be Their Children.
And the Lady said, "Let us go forth and make Life upon the many worlds, that We may have Children, and a Family of Life within the MultiVerse. And let Us make them in Our image, and love and be loved in return."
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said the Sacred King.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled the Youth.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said the Child.
And the Fool smiled, and said, "If we do this thing, it shall be a wondrous thing indeed, for we shall make a Creature that shall have the Love of the Lady, and the Strength of the Lord, and a Curiosity to match Myself. It shall know Good and Evil, and Light and Darkness, and That which stands between them, and shall be very near and dear to us. It shall be arrogant, and willful, and cruel, but it shall also be kind, and gentle and loving. It shall be all things, and nothing at all."
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said Chaos.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled Trickster.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said Prometheus.
The Fool took up the stuff of stars, that whispers through the MultiVerse, and mixed it with the dry clay of earth, and mixed the substance thereby made with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden, and the birth-waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet it was with the blood of the Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on the lips of the Child.
And the Fool laughed, and asked, "Shall it be so?"
"No," said the Crone.
And the Fool asked a second time, and said, "Shall it be so?"
"Maybe," smiled the Maiden.
And the Fool asked a third time, saying, "Shall it be so?"
"Yes!" said the Mother.
And the Fool smiled, and said, "Then let it be so, for I have asked three times, and three times three, and thus it is and so it ever shall be!"
The Holy Fool bent, and sank to His knees, and She took the wet clay, wet with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden, and the birth-waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet with the blood of the Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on the lips of the Child.
And from that clay He made our Brothers and Sisters in Fur, Feather and Scale, and all the growing things.
And one thing made of that clay was taken up by the Fool, and placed aside.
And the Lady smiled upon Her Lord.
And the Fool turned, and It was Prometheus, and shaped the wet clay thing further.
Side by side, He made them, that none should stand above the other, but that all should walk as equals and partners, in joy and love.
And the Fool turned, and It was Trickster, who shaped us to be curious, and to doubt, and from our doubt and curiosity, to learn, and to laugh.
And the Fool turned, and She was Chaos, and placed a bit of Itself within us, that we may change and grow.
And the Lord smiled upon His Lady.
Man and Woman Prometheus made, and the making and the shaping was as years, and years upon years.
And the Fool began to dance.
And the Lady began to dance.
And the Lord began to dance.
They danced Life into the World, the Lady and the Lord, and the Fool. They danced the moon, and stars, and Sun, and all that there is, they danced into being.
And they danced Death into the World, for we must close the Circle of our Being, and go forth unto newness.
They danced Life and Death, and still They dance, a never-ending, ever-spinning Circle, endlessly spiraling upon itself, and uncoiling to start anew; hand in hand They dance, to a Music They have made, endlessly creating, and endlessly destroying.
Thus it was, and so it is, and evermore shall be so!Fidelity is a word that is often narrowly defined in terms of marital fidelity. By the dictionary, it simply means being faithful to someone or something. In marriage, this means being true to one's vows and partner, often limiting one's sexual experience to one's spouse. While this is practical advice, many treat fidelity as if there were no other ways to be faithful or unfaithful. For Asatruar, fidelity is most important in terms of faith and troth to the Gods. We must remain true to the Aesir and Vanir and to our kinsmen. Like marriage, Profession (the rite in which one enters the Asatru faith) is a sacred bond between an Asatruar and the Gods. Both must be honest and faithful to each other for the relationship to work. Asatru, although currently being reborn, is at its roots a folk religion, and we uphold the value of fidelity to the ways of our ancestors. This is why historical research is so important to the Asatru-folk: it is the rediscovering of our ancient ways and our readoption of them.

Discipline in Asatru is best described as self-discipline. It is the exercise of personal will that upholds honor and the other virtues, translating impulse into action. Rejecting moral legalism for a system of internal honor requires self-discipline. Without it, we have the mess we currently see in our culture. Discipline is closely connected to fidelity. Many Pagans go from faith to faith, but Asatruar are less likely to do this. The discipline of keeping faith with our Gods and the ways of our ancestors is part of our modern practice. This limits us in some ways but gains us much more in others.

Hospitality is a core value at the heart of virtually every ancient human civilization. In a community/folk religion like ours, it upholds our social fabric. In ancient times, it was essential for a traveler to find shelter and welcome for the night. In modern times, it is just as essential for a traveler to find friendship and safety. In our modern Asatru community, we need to treat each other with respect and act together for the good of our community. This functions most solidly on the level of the kindred or hearth, where nonfamilial members become extremely close and look out for each other. Hospitality can mean taking in people, loaning someone a car, or a bit of money when they need it. It also means treating other people with respect and dignity. Many of our Gods are known to wander the world, testing hospitality and generosity. The virtue of hospitality means seeing people as individuals with self-respect and importance. This has profound implications for social action in our religion. Our response to societal problems such as poverty is our modern reaction to this ancient virtue. In terms of our modern community, hospitality is like frontier "barn raisings" where a whole community would come together and pool their resources. This doesn't mean we have to forget differences, but we must put them aside for those who are of our Folk and work for our common good.

Industriousness is essential for modern Asatruar. We need to work hard to achieve our goals. We've set ourselves the task of restoring Asatru to its former place as a mainstream faith and reinvigorating our society and culture. We can't do this by sitting on our virtues; we need to make them an active part of our behavior. Industry also refers to simple hard work in our daily vocations, done with care and pride. If you don't have a kindred, why not? Place ads in local stores, get your name on networking lists, and with other Pagan groups. Put on a workshop. If you don't agree with what I'm saying, be industrious! Write your own articles and arguments. Write a letter to the editor. Get the blood moving and go out and do it. The Gods do not favor the lazy. As Asatruar, we should offer a good example as industrious people who add to whatever we're involved in rather than take from it. We should be the ones the business we work in can't do without and the ones who always seem to get things done. When people think of Asatru, they should think of people who are competent and who offer something to the world. This applies to vocational work and the entire way we live our lives. The Vikings were vital people. They lived each day to its fullest and didn't wring their hands in doubt or hesitation. We should put the same attitude forward in all that we do, whether it is our usual vocation, devotion to the Gods, or leisure time.

Self-reliance is important both in practical and traditional terms. We rely on ourselves to administer our own morality. Traditionally, our folkways have always honored the ability of a man or woman to make their own way in the world and not lean on others for their physical needs. Hospitality cannot function if people are not responsible enough to exercise discipline and take care of themselves. It's for those that strive and fail or need assistance that hospitality is intended, not for the idle who simply won't take care of themselves. In terms of our relationships with the Gods, self-reliance is also very important. If we wish the Gods to offer us their blessings and gifts, we must make ourselves worthy of them. The Gods are most pleased with someone who stands on their own two feet. This is one of the reasons for the Asatru rule that we do not kneel to the Gods during our ceremonies. By standing, we acknowledge our relationship as striving and fulfilled people looking for comradeship and a relationship, rather than acting as scraelings looking for a handout from on high. Being self-reliant is a simple way to allow ourselves the ability to live as we wish to. In simple economic terms, if one has enough money in the bank, one doesn't need to worry as much about being fired due to religious discrimination. We can look a bigot in the face and tell him just where he can put it. It's also nice to have something in the bank to lay down as a retainer on a good lawyer so we can take appropriate action. On the other side of this is self-reliance in the sense of Henry David Thoreau, who advocated a simple lifestyle that freed one from the temptations of materialism. Religious people from all faiths have found that adjusting one's material desires to match one's ability to meet them leaves one open for a closer relationship with deity and a more fulfilling life. While our ancestors were great collectors of gold goodies, they didn't lust for possessions in and of themselves, but for what they stood for and could do for them. In fact, the greatest thing that could be said of a Lord was that he was a good "Ring Giver." Being self-reliant also means taking responsibility for one's life. It's not just about refusing a welfare check or not lobbying for a tax exemption, but also refusing to blame one's failures on religious intolerance, the patriarchy, or an unfair system. The system may, in fact, be unfair, but it's our own responsibility to deal with it. In societal terms, we have become much too dependent on other people for our own good. As individuals, we look to the government or to others to solve our problems, and as a society, we borrow billions from our descendants to pay for today's excesses. Most problems in this world could be solved if people just paid their own way as they went.

Perseverance is the final virtue, most appropriate because it is the one we most need to keep in mind in living the other values. Our religion teaches us that the world is an imperfect place, and nothing comes easy. We need to continue to seek after that which we desire. In this imperfect world, there are no free lunches or easy accomplishments, especially in the subjects we have set before ourselves. If we truly wish to build an Asatru community that people will hold up as an example of what committed people can do, then we must persevere through the hardships that building our religion is going to entail. We must be willing to continue on when we are pushed back. If one loses a job for one's religion, the answer is not to go back and hide, but to continue until one finds a vocation where one can move forward and live as an Asatruar should. Finally, we must persevere when we simply fail. If one's kindred falls apart because of internal strife, one should go back and start over. Pick up the pieces and continue on. If nobody had done this after the disintegration of the Asatru Free Assembly, this would probably never have been written. We must be willing to continue in the hard work of making our religion strong, not just when it is convenient and easy to do so, but when it gets hard, inconvenient, or just plain boring. To accomplish without striving is to do little, but to persevere and finally accomplish a hard-fought goal brings great honor.The Temple Ov Psychick Youth emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and the release of the sexual spirit to free emotions from dogma and external control. This process is deeply personal, with the Temple acting as a guiding light and a processor of information. The Temple serves as a sounding board for ideas, provoking thought and fostering growth. It is a force that could challenge the preconceived ideas of Western society, much like a small virus or cancer cell can cause the collapse of an organism. The Temple supports individuality, offers no dogma, and aims for the realization of oneself, resulting in selflessness and the ultimate goal of love and freedom from 20th-century ideas and values. The Temple encourages thinking and spreading freedom, with a focus on sexuality without guilt. The Psychick Cross and the number 23 are significant symbols within the Temple, representing integration, growth, and the unexplored forces that act upon us. The Temple provides a means for people to break free from societal lies and explore their true wills through magick and witchcraft. It encourages people to be free within themselves and discover their true potential.Sputnik was alone and new, around the time Ken Kesey took his first acid trip as a medical volunteer. This was before underground newspapers, the Vietnam War, and talk of a second American Revolution. In the quiet of the late 1950s, just before the idea of a Renaissance became relevant, two young Californians, later known as Omar Ravenhurst and Malaclypse the Younger, were sipping coffee at an all-night bowling alley, solving the world's problems. They discussed discord and personal confusion, agreeing that solving discord would solve all other problems. Suddenly, the place became devoid of light, enveloped in utter silence and stillness, followed by a blinding flash of intense light. When vision returned, they saw the bowlers frozen like statues and a chimpanzee carrying a scroll. The chimpanzee asked them philosophical questions and revealed a diagram before exploding, causing the two to lose consciousness. They awoke to the sound of pins clattering, realizing their experience had been private. They reconstructed the chimpanzee's diagram and discovered the ancient Goddess Eris, known to the Romans as Discordia. They had vivid dreams of a splendid woman who told them they were free. They studied philosophies and learned that Eris was feared as disruptive, but they concluded that disorder was as significant as order. They meditated on the strange yin-yang, which they called the Sacred Chao, and were appointed Keepers of It. They declared themselves a society of Discordia, embracing the idea that there are no rules unless one chooses to invent them.This will contain the original content of the document, unchanged just edited to be more readable and AI friendly.

"You will show me how to be whole again. I know you are safe now, and nothing can harm you. Remember, although we're apart, we will always be together.

Part 2
Life and death are one, as the river and the sea are one. For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind, And to melt in the sun? What is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides That it may rise, and expand, and seek its Gods unencumbered? Only when you drink from the river of silence Shall you indeed sing. And when you have reached the mountaintop, Then shall you begin to climb. And when the Earth has claimed your limbs, then shall you truly dance.

(The following poem was written by my father - he says now that it is crude doggerel, but it speaks from his heart)
Vicki, Fate was most unkind,
Gave adult's body, but child's mind.
Yet from you so much love was spread
Everywhere you were seen to tread.
We'd like to think where'er you roam
In the new world you'll call your home,
There'll be no more pain, no more ills,
No more of this life's bitter pills.
Forgive us if today we're sad,
For we loved you so much - Mum and Dad.

Part 3
(This was read as the coffin was taken from the room used for the service to the crematorium)
Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am not there, I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow,
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am sun on ripened grain,
I am the gentle Autumn's rain.
When you wake in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry,
I am not there, I did not die.

Those who were at the service, Pagan, Christian, and agnostic alike, all felt that these words expressed the "right" things at the death of a much-loved person.
Blessed be
O C

... But to be born again, you must die

TO WICCEN OR NOT TO WICCEN......
by Vivienne West
Christians "christen" a child shortly after it comes into the world. Surely, then, it would make sense for Wiccans to "wiccen" a child at the same age - or even earlier.
I have an objection to the christening ceremony based on my fundamental belief in the right of the individual to make their own free choice. The christening ceremony, usually if not always performed on a person who is far too small to speak for themselves, condemns the child to at least nominal Christianity all their life. Their parents are sworn to raise the child as a Christian no matter how obviously unhappy that makes their offspring, and statements are made in ritual about the actual belief-system of the child. This is abhorrent to me: no one should ever make binding magical promises (and all rituals, even Christian ones, are magical) about someone who cannot speak for themselves and whose preferences are not known.
Now, I have read short articles in various Pagan magazines in the past (one in particular I remember, but Murphy has got to my mind, so I can remember neither the title nor the authors' names) in which people have laid out ritual events or scripts that do exactly the same thing, only in Wiccan terms instead of Christian ones. This, too, even as a Wiccan, I find distasteful. Once again, a person (even if they think of themself as a concerned, caring parent) is forcing their own belief-system and value-judgements on someone who is too young and helpless to speak for themself.
I do believe in celebrating the event of birth. Birth is a huge step: it is a statement about the individual's choice of environment and associates for up to the next hundred years or so. It marks the beginning of a period known as life, in which the individual is offered chances to grow and develop, as well as to experience pleasures and pain. Birth should be celebrated, and it is fitting to celebrate it in front of the Gods.
But even as a part of such celebration, do I have any right to insist that my infant child is going to grow up into being Wiccan? Obviously, as a Wiccan whose every aspect of life is influenced by my belief-system, I am going to teach my child about the Craft and try to instill a love of the Gods that I know and love. I am going to try to teach a love of the magical way of looking at the world, as opposed to the boring old way everyone else looks at things. Yet if my offspring, while knowing all they can about the Craft, decide it is not for them and some other path (or no path at all) is the only right and fitting way to live their life, then that is their decision. I have no right, even at this early stage, to condemn them to a lifetime of Wicca, no matter what.
On the other hand, though, as a caring parent I have every right and every emotional need to do whatever I can to protect and bless my child. I will definitely do a working when this infant I am carrying is born. This will be along the lines of an introduction or presentation of my child to the Old Ones, and an asking of their blessing and protection on him/her. It will not, however, be a ceremony formally inducting the child into Wicca. That can wait until such time as he/she expresses an interest in initiation.

I suppose I would say that theoretically any magic that can be worked
with ritual and/or tools can also be done without. The caveat with this
is that most of us (self included) don't have the skills, knowledge
and/or power to do without the ritual/tools for certain complicated
powerful working, IMHO. Though perhaps if we worked without tools or
ritual more often we'd get better at it... ;) Seriously, though, I'm
not advocating dropping the tools or ritual --- they're useful. And I
think it's better to do what's useful than to work until you're ninety
before you finally get good at it!
SB>Tools sometimes mean much more than just a focus, more than just a
SB>way to get to where you are going. Ofttimes the tools themselves are
SB>invested of the very life necessary to work the magic.
You're speaking here of tools which carry energy or intelligence, I
assume? I was referring to tools which are made by the worker or by
another worker for the purpose of someone else using them. In my
understanding tools are more useful if they carry energy or
intelligence. If they do, it's because the worker put it there. I
differentiate these from tools which acquire energy or intelligence
through a process other than human intervention.

It sounds to me like in that circumstance we are depriving ourselves of
the opportunity to work with another intelligence. When you use the word
"soul" I presume you mean "entity" as well, to which I attribute some
level of intelligence.
SB>Any tradition that believes in the vesting of power down through the

Not tools. The vesting of power and passing of knowledge is through (as
I comprehend it currently) the partnership of human and deity. As I see
it, the process of initiation (which many workers use, including all of
the shamanistic paths that I know anything about) does several things:
1) charters the individual with membership in the group with all the
rights and responsibilities involved thereof. 2) Passes power or
knowledge from the initiator to the initiate (sometimes the power or
knowledge is seen as coming from elsewhere, such as a deity). 3)
Formally introduces the initiate to the energy and/or deities of the
tradition. 4) Creates a new personality for the initiate which
sometimes supplants the old one. I'm sure there are points I've missed
and not all initiations do all these things.
SB>What is this personalThe sisters heard this and confronted Void, pleading not to be forgotten. Void decreed that their brother, having no form, would reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then with Eris in Being. Eris, filled with sorrow, wept. Void asked why she was despondent, and she replied that Aneris would take their brother from her. Void then decreed that when their brother left Being, he would return to Void, not Non-Being. Thus, men do not exist until they do, playing with order and disorder, and non-existence takes us back. "Everything is true - Everything is permissible!" - Hassan i Sabbah

A POEE MYSTEREE RITE - THE SRI SYADASTIAN CHANT
Written by Mal-2

Unlike a song, chants are chanted. This one is enhanced by a Leader chanting Sanskrit alone, with participants chanting the English. It helps to be in a quiet frame of mind, sitting still, perhaps in The Buttercup Position. It also helps if one is absolutely zonked out of his gourd.

The Classification of Saints:
1. SAINT SECOND CLASS: Reserved for all human beings deserving of Sainthood. Example: St. Norton the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.
2. LANCE SAINT: Good Saint material and definitely inspiring. Example: St. Yossarian (Catch 22, Heller).
3. LIEUTENANT SAINT: Excellent Goddess-Saturated Saint. Example: St. Quixote (Don Quixote, Cervantes).
4. BRIGADIER SAINT: Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following. Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut).
5. FIVE STAR SAINT: The Five Apostles of Eris.

It is an Old Erisian Tradition to never agree with each other about Saints. Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand Herman Hesse. Only a handful understood Albert Einstein. And nobody understood Emperor Norton.

TESTS BY DOCTORS PROVE IT POSSIBLE TO SHRINK

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites--good/evil, positive/negative, male/female, etc. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS. Magicians, and progeny the scientists, have always taken themselves and their subject in an orderly and sober manner, thereby disregarding an essential metaphysical balance. When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, then they will be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart, and perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it, and therefore gain more effective magic.

CHAOS IS ENERGY. This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

"Study Demonology with an Enemy This Sunday" sez Thom, Gnos

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM:
1) On your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely midnight, noting your birth time and date of observation, count all visible stars.
2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.

The Eminent 16th Century Mathematician Cardan so detested Luther that he altered Luther's birthdate to give him an unfavorable horoscope.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1, each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number. This contradicts the original assumption.

"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only."

THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM:
To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE:
Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere for their just protection. The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:
Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar:
The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK A GAME by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS:
SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.
PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing... in water or mud or anything you can sink something in.
RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or a hole to drop things in. But rivers, bays, gulfs, I dare say even oceans can be used.
TURNS are taken thusly: whosoever gets the junk up and in the air first.
DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.
UPON SINKING: The sinked shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as thoughtful.
NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus, Ohio!"

Don't worry much about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait for nature. Don't soak them if it's wintertime.

TO WICCEN OR NOT TO WICCEN......
by Vivienne West
Christians "christen" a child shortly after it comes into the world. Surely, then, it would make sense for Wiccans to "wiccen" a child at the same age - or even earlier.
I have an objection to the christening ceremony based on my fundamental belief in the right of the individual to make their own free choice. The christening ceremony, usually if not always performed on a person who is far too small to speak for themselves, condemns the child to at least nominal Christianity all their life. Their parents are sworn to raise the child as a Christian no matter how obviously unhappy that makes their offspring, and statements are made in ritual about the actual belief-system of the child. This is abhorrent to me: no one should ever make binding magical promises (and all rituals, even Christian ones, are magical) about someone who cannot speak for themselves and whose preferences are not known.
Now, I have read short articles in various Pagan magazines in the past (one in particular I remember, but Murphy has got to my mind, so I can remember neither the title nor the authors' names) in which people have laid out ritual events or scripts that do exactly the same thing, only in Wiccan terms instead of Christian ones. This, too, even as a Wiccan, I find distasteful. Once again, a person (even if they think of themself as a concerned, caring parent) is forcing their own belief-system and value-judgements on someone who is too young and helpless to speak for themself.
I do believe in celebrating the event of birth. Birth is a huge step: it is a statement about the individual's choice of environment and associates for up to the next hundred years or so. It marks the beginning of a period known as life, in which the individual is offered chances to grow and develop, as well as to experience pleasures and pain. Birth should be celebrated, and it is fitting to celebrate it in front of the Gods.
But even as a part of such celebration, do I have any right to insist that my infant child is going to grow up into being Wiccan? Obviously, as a Wiccan whose every aspect of life is influenced by my belief-system, I am going to teach my child about the Craft and try to instill a love of the Gods that I know and love. I am going to try to teach a love of the magical way of looking at the world, as opposed to the boring old way everyone else looks at things. Yet if my offspring, while knowing all they can about the Craft, decide it is not for them and some other path (or no path at all) is the only right and fitting way to live their life, then that is their decision. I have no right, even at this early stage, to condemn them to a lifetime of Wicca, no matter what.
On the other hand, though, as a caring parent I have every right and every emotional need to do whatever I can to protect and bless my child. I will definitely do a working when this infant I am carrying is born. This will be along the lines of an introduction or presentation of my child to the Old Ones, and an asking of their blessing and protection on him/her. It will not, however, be a ceremony formally inducting the child into Wicca. That can wait until such time as he/she expresses an interest in initiation.

intelligence. If they do, it's because the worker put it there. I
differentiate these from tools which acquire energy or intelligence
through a process other than human intervention.

It sounds to me like in that circumstance we are depriving ourselves of
the opportunity to work with another intelligence. When you use the word
"soul" I presume you mean "entity" as well, to which I attribute some
level of intelligence.

Not tools. The vesting of power and passing of knowledge is through (as
I comprehend it currently) the partnership of human and deity. As I see
it, the process of initiation (which many workers use, including all of
the shamanistic paths that I know anything about) does several things:
1) charters the individual with membership in the group with all the
rights and responsibilities involved thereof. 2) Passes power or
knowledge from the initiator to the initiate (sometimes the power or
knowledge is seen as coming from elsewhere, such as a deity). 3)
Formally introduces the initiate to the energy and/or deities of the
tradition. 4) Creates a new personality for the initiate which
sometimes supplants the old one. I'm sure there are points I've missed
and not all initiations do all these things.

              "hold up the pomegranate, saying:           Behold the pomegranate, fruit of Life ... The athame is plunged into the pomegranate, splitting it open to display the seeds.  She says:           Whose seeds lie in the dormancy of Death! The Priestess eats one of the seeds, saying:           I Taste the seeds of Death. The pomegranate is then passed hand to hand through the participants of the ritual, each eating a seed and saying to the next person, \"Taste the seeds of Death.\" The Priestess then holds up the apple, saying: 2425           Behold the apple: fruit of wisdom, fruit of Death... She then cuts the apple crosswise, saying:           Whose symbolism rewards us with life eternal! She holds up the apple, displaying the inner pentagram, and says:           Behold the five-fold star - the promise of rebirth! Consecrate the fruit and wine.  Each person then tastes of the apple and sips the wine, saying to the next person:           Taste the fruit of rebirth and sip from the cup           of wine of Life. After libation, the Priestess presents each member of the group with a small pot of earth, planted with three seeds [preferably rue or lavendar].  She briefly explains to the group that this is the season of the seed - it is a time of dormancy, but also a time of re-generation for growth.  Further, as the seed rests in the earth, they should also take time to rest and re-evaluate their lives, metaphorically planting only those values which will enrich and enhance the growth within the Divine Self.  She then instructs them to name the seeds within their pots with three values they wish to incorporate into their lives, knowing that as the seeds sprout with new life, their lives will be new, as well. After the presentation, all join hands and hold them skyward. PRIESTESS    Thus is the Circle of Rebirth.              All pass from this life through the great god, Pan      But through My love you are all reborn              In the cycles of nature - through the Cosmic Plan.

Physicists currently interpret physical creation, that is, the universe as we know it, as having occurred within a time span o about three minutes...the \"Big Bang.\"  Our physical universe is thought to have been created with the explosion of a hyper-dense particle which contained every bit of matter and energy that now exists in the universe, including the matter which forms our living bodies as we meet here today.  This hyper-dense super molecule also is thought to have been quite small.  Dr. Leon Friedman, director of the FermiLab near Chicago, has indicated it may have ben no larger than a basket ball.  Into this \"ball\" was jammed all matter and all energy in our universe.  It remained there until some creative force, some creative urge, disrupted the status of this primal \"egg\" and set into being the universe as we know it.  this event occurred with the so-called \"Big Bang,\" echoes of which have been detected by scientific instruments. Our interpretation of the nature of this creative force or creative urge is opposed to that of Judeo-Christianity in that we perceive it as feminine...they see it as masculine.  We hold that pre-creation was feminine and this divergence in concept of first Things, creation, forever separates our Neopagan world-view from the Judeo-Christians.  Briefly consider this, and you may want to dwell upon it later, our Goddess, of Her own will, receives Her consort, the God whom she created, and from Their union our creation is ever revived and sustained.  The Christian reviver and sustainer, on the other hand, was conceived in a most singular manner.  The omnipotent God sent a neuter third party messenger, and angel, to announce to a virgin that she was pregnant with the child, Jesus.  So there.  Zap!  What a put-down!  What revival and sustenance can we find in such a sterile and asexual concept?  Even masculine old Zeus copulated with human females so at least somebody got some fun out of the process!  What we Neopagans find difficult to understand is why Judeo-Christianity so vehemently turned its back on sex and not just sex as a physical act but also sex as a gender, specifically, sex as a feminine gender. When we seek to deal with Creation we also must situate our place as human beings within the totality of Creation.  The orthodox Judeo-Christian view gives humans a special place within Creation; that is, that we are not part of general creation but a special creation...\"Man was created in the image of God\"...and the rest of creation is our plaything...\"Yours is the earth and everything on it.\"  There is no need to expound upon our rejection of these two fundamental points:  of course we are not created in any special way, any more than is a rock or a tree or a raccoon or a galaxy, nor do we have dominion over anything.  We are a part of general creation along with every other particle of matter in the universe. I hope you grasp the vast difference this makes; it forever separates us from the Judeo-Christian heritage and it s a gulf 2427 that cannot be bridged.  They must forever consider themselves special and we must forever consider ourselves general and one with creation.  And it is given to us to look at a grain of sand and in that grain see the sum total of creation and to see ourselves as part of it and to gibe thanks for the creative force of the Goddess and Her consort that sustains this creation. CHAOS... With Chaos, as with so many other concepts, we must think on at least two levels, the physical and the mythical, to come to any sort of understanding of ourselves and what we really believe about our place in creation.  And it is this belief, this understanding that is the ultimate determination of how we live as human beings upon this beautiful Earth.  That is what we Neopagans are trying to do right now:  learn to think differently that Western man has thought in nearly two-thousand years in order that we may live in a renewed relationship with creation. It is an exciting adventure. Before there was form, there was Chaos.  We may well suppose Chaos represents the disordered formlessness of matter and energy in that initial \"Big Bang\" of the primordial egg in those first three minutes when creation began.  Mythologically, we see this formlessness as before the Earth and Sky were separated, as before the four elements, actually the four states of matter, had coalesced into their separate forms.  The myths speak darkly of this time, of the births of the Titans, Cyclops and 100-handed monsters, of a father who devours his own young...what better way to represent Chaos! We may assume, too, we have our own dark and personal counterpart to this primal Chaos.  Is it that black win that whips at the raveled edge o sanity?  I believe our ancestors felt far more keenly than we can understand in this present age a constant fear that what order they had managed to being to their lives, indeed, what order they could see in creation around them, would suddenly collapse and they would be plunged into chaos and madness.  Greek myths are redolent with stories of madness and possession.  Even great Heracles fell victim.  It is no wonder, then, the gods of chaos are said to have been chained beneath the Earth, castrated, even devoured.  But they still live, they still canThe man who was healed was now too disgusted to touch the other leper and would have left him, but Brigit herself washed the leper and struck down the other arrogant fellow with leprosy once more before he could leave. Offerings to the watery Brigit were cast into the well in the form of coins or, even more ancient, brass or gold rings. Other sacrifices were offered where three streams came together. Her cauldron of Inspiration connected her watery healing aspect with her fiery poetic aspect.

Brigit is clearly the best example of the survival of a Goddess into Christian times. She was canonized by the Catholic church as St. Brigit, and various origins are given to this saint. The most popular folktale is that she was midwife to the Virgin Mary and thus was always invoked by women in labor. The more official story was that she was a Druid's daughter who predicted the coming of Christianity and then was baptized by St. Patrick. She became a nun and later an abbess who founded the Abbey at Kildare. The Christian Brigit was said to have had the power to appoint the bishops of her area, a strange role for an abbess, made stranger by her requirement that her bishops also be practicing goldsmiths.

Actually, the Goddess Brigit had always kept a shrine at Kildare, Ireland, with a perpetual flame tended by nineteen virgin priestesses called Daughters of the Flame. No male was ever allowed to come near it; nor did those women ever consort with men. Even their food and other supplies were brought to them by women of the nearby village. When Catholicism took over in Ireland, the shrine became a convent, and the priestesses became nuns, but the same traditions were held, and the eternal flame was kept burning. Their tradition was that each day a different priestess/nun was in charge of the sacred fire, and on the 20th day of each cycle, the fire was miraculously tended by Brigit herself. There into the 18th century, the ancient song was sung to her: "Brigit, excellent woman, sudden flame, may the bright fiery sun take us to the lasting kingdom."

For over a thousand years, the sacred flame was tended by nuns, and no one knows how long before that it had been tended by the priestesses. In 1220 CE, a Bishop became angered by the no-males policy of the Abbey of St. Brigit of Kildare. He insisted that nuns were subordinate to priests and therefore must open their abbey and submit themselves to inspection by a priest. When they refused and asked for another Abbess or other female official to perform any inspections, the Bishop was incensed. He admonished them to obedience and then decreed that the keeping of the eternal flame was a Pagan custom and ordered the sacred flame to be extinguished. Even then, she remained the most popular Irish saint along with Patrick. In the 1960s, under Vatican II modernization, it was declared that there was insufficient proof of Brigit's sanctity or even of her historical existence, and so the Church's gradual pogrom against Brigit was successful at last, and she was thus decanonized. It is very difficult to obtain images or even holy cards of St. Brigit outside of Ireland anymore.

Her festival is held on February 1st or 2nd. It corresponds to the ancient Celtic fire festival of Imbolc or Oimelc, which celebrated the birthing and freshening of sheep and goats (it really is a Feast of Milk). This festival was Christianized as Candlemas or Lady Day, and her Feast day, La Feill Bhride, was attended by tremendous local celebration and elaborate rituals. Her festival is also called Brigit. Brigit (the Goddess and the Festival) represents the stirring of life again after the dead months of the winter, and her special blessings are called forth at this time. Since she was booted out of the Church for being Pagan, it is incumbent upon us Pagans to restore her worship to its former glory, especially those of us of Celtic ancestry. Here is an ancient rite to invite Brigit into your home at the time of her Holiday:

Clean your hearth thoroughly in the morning and lay a fire without kindling it, then make yourself a "Bed for Brigid" and place it near the hearth. The bed can be a small basket with covers and a tiny pillow added as plain or fancy as you like. If you have no hearth, you can use the stove and put the bed behind it. Then at sundown, light a candle rubbed with rosemary oil and invite Brigit into your home and into her bed; use the candle to kindle your hearth fire if possible. Make your own poem to invite her or use the ancient song mentioned earlier. Let the candle burn at least all night in a safe place. You might even want to begin the custom of keeping the eternal flame; it is a popular custom in some magical and Wiccan traditions. After all, it's up to us now to keep the spirit of Brigit alive and well for the next thousand years at least!

Brigid is not really a Celtic Mother Goddess. She is generally considered a Goddess of fire/smithcraft, of poetry, and of healing. One of her roles is as midwife, but although she has a son, she is not usually seen as a mother. I don't know any books that deal specifically with Brighidh, but please look for a book called "Celtic Mythology" by Proinsias MacCana and for "Gods and Heroes of the Celts" by Marie Louise Sjoestadt for more information about Celtic deities. They are both VERY good sources.

Brighidh is a Goddess of healing, smithcraft, and poetry, brewer of mead and ale, a lawgiver, a midwife, supposedly daughter of the Daghda, mother of the poet Cairbre, and of the Gods Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba. She was transformed into a Christian Saint and became the foster mother of Christ. Some sources say that the healer/smith/poet were embodied in one Goddess, other sources claim that she was three sisters, all named Brighidh. Her holy day falls (on our calendar) on February 2nd (I wonder if she likes groundhogs...) called Imbolc, Oimelc, or Lady Day. Candles are blessed that day in the Catholic churches.

Brigit/Brigid/Bride was the daughter of Dagda. She was the protector of the poets, the forge, and the healing persons. Her son Ruadan, which she had with Bres, was killed by Goibnui. For her dead son, she sounds the first kenning of Ireland. She also was put into the cult and the person of Brigit from Kildare, which made the first female parish after Christianity fell into Ireland. The convent of Kildare had a never-ending fire, which was protected by the sisters of the parish. The saint Brigit is the second patron saint of Ireland. Within the Scottish tradition, Brigit belongs together with the time of the year "Season of the lambs" and the coming of spring. Brigit overcomes the control of the Cailleach Bheur.During a discussion, participants shared their thoughts on various sources for rituals and practices. One person mentioned taking inspiration from Doreen Valiente, the Farrars, and Starhawk, noting that these sources are often geared towards covens. Mike Nichols emphasized the importance of not mixing different cultural elements within a single ritual, suggesting that one could perform a Celtic ritual one month and an Egyptian ritual the next, but not combine them. Carolyn Clark shared her approach to invoking different aspects of the Goddess from various cultures during specific rituals. Nichols highlighted the power of repetitive elements in rituals, comparing them to litanies in the Roman Catholic tradition, which can build significant energy. He also discussed the balance between spontaneous and structured elements in rituals, noting that repetitive practices can free the mind to reach deeper levels of consciousness. The conversation touched on the importance of rhythm and silence in rituals, and the potential pitfalls of constantly changing rituals, which can turn participants into spectators rather than active participants. The session concluded with Nichols expressing his appreciation for the group's contributions and encouraging them to continue their work in Pagan liturgical theology.Document Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

PAGAN MANNERS OR Are There Any Dead Animals in The Soup? by Grey Cat, Members Advocate

I can hear the outraged screams already. There are people out there who believe that the very idea of "Pagan Manners" is a conflict in terms; that "manners" are outdated, dishonest and hypocritical. Well, think again. Manners constitute the only successful technique ever discovered by humankind to enable groups and individuals, holding moderately disparate views, customs or beliefs, to get along together. There are things more important than manners; but, without manners, it's unlikely that a discussion will ever go to them. Pagan manners are fairly simple and have nothing to do with which fork you use or how to word an invitation. They have to do with respect for others' feelings and beliefs. They most specifically have to do with recognition of the fact that you should "judge not the path of your brother or sister for their path is sacred." Manners are also the only way of attempting to grant everyone the personal space which each of us needs. There have been a number of attempts to write down a list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots" which will cover Pagan life. Here are several tries made by four different people:

MY OWN OPINIONS
1. Never assume that you are invited to a ritual or a non-public gathering just because your friend is invited. Have your friend call the group doing the event and ASK! (or call yourself).
2. When participating in a ritual led by a group of which you are not a member, ask ahead of time what will be done. Should there be something in the explanation, or in the set-up of the ritual area which bothers you, just quietly don't participate in the ritual.
3. Ask the person(s) officiating at a ritual before you place anything in the ritual area; wear clothing or tools which might be considered unusual; or add private energy workings to the ritual being done.
4. Never just walk out of a cast ritual circle. Ask someone in the group sponsoring the ritual to cut you a door if you really and truly absolutely have to leave.
5. Don't make comments on the ritual, its leaders or the amount or quality of the energy raised during the ritual unless such opinions are asked for by the leaders. Save it for your friends, privately, after the ritual is over.
6. Vegetarians, Vegans, Strict Carnivores, Diabetics, and any others with very strong food preferences: no one minds your asking quietly and politely "Which dishes have meat (sugar, spices, hot pepper, etc.) in them?" When planning a meal for mixed Pagan/Wiccan groups, it is strongly suggested that at least some of the dishes be vegetarian, sugar-free, relatively non-spicy etc. At all times, within and without the ritual context, always provide an alternative to alcoholic beverages.
7. While many people have become far less secretive about their membership in a Pagan group, it is never, EVER, permissible to "blow someone's cover". Do not ever call a friend or acquaintance by their Pagan name or mention their membership in a mundane situation. It is also bad manners - and a symptom of social climbing - to call an individual by his/her mundane name in a Pagan situation. It always reminds me of an extra calling John Wayne "The Duke" at a local bar.
8. Whether you drink, take drugs or indulge in other similar behavior is completely your own business. It is always wrong to urge such behavior on any other individual. The majority of serious Pagan groups absolutely do NOT allow anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol to participate in ritual. Do not be offended if you are turned away for this reason. If you are taking a psycho-active drug for a medical reason it is very wise to check with the ritual leader(s) so they will understand and can advise you if they feel the ritual might be harmful to you.
9. Just because most Pagans/Wiccans are under 40 and in reasonably good physical condition, never assume that everyone is. Rituals and gatherings should be planned so that those with physical problems aren't barred totally from participation. Particularly in ritual, be aware that many more people than you might think are "mobility disabled." Group ritual should take place in an accessible area and some thought should be given to designating a safe place for those not taking part in dancing to stand or sit. Please be alert to anyone to whom help would be welcome. Help them to find a campsite which minimizes walking - to the ritual area, to the privies, to the eating area - whatever. Help them pitch their camp. Don't make them feel unwelcome - most handicapped people have worked extra hard on their magickal skills and may be able to add a great deal to the power in ritual and to the success of the gathering.
10. When at any sort of gathering, please be thoughtful. Particularly please observe true quiet after midnight. No one minds if you and others want to stay up all night talking or whatever. Everyone else minds a great deal if you stay up talking and laughing loudly and/or drumming. Those hosting a gathering should take the responsibility of keeping the noise level very low in at least some of the sleeping areas - and designating it as a quiet area.
11. Do not allow yourself to get the idea that you know the One True, Right and Only Path! Even if you really do have the conviction that what someone else is doing is "wrong", "incorrect", "Left-hand path" or whatever, just don't talk about it. It is perfectly permissible to refrain from participating in the activities of those with whom you cannot feel comfortable. It is not acceptable to express the idea that they "shouldn't" be doing it. This is not to say that if you know of criminal behavior on the part of a so-called Pagan/Wiccan group you should not report it. We must also be responsible for cleaning up our own act. Paganism is glorified by its diversity. Please do not allow yourself to express judgment by categories. Whether or not you like or dislike blacks, Indians, Homosexuals, women, men, or whatever, keep it to yourself! If you really and truly cannot feel comfortable taking part in a ritual which isn't conducted according to the tradition you follow or if you cannot be pleasant in company mixed with groups you disapprove of, please just stay home.

PAGAN/CRAFT ETIQUETTE by Soapbox Sam
Listed below are not hard and fast rules, but some helpful guidelines for those who would function smoothly in a craft/Pagan environment.
1. Should you write to someone for information, always enclose an SASE (Self-addressed, Stamped Envelope). Many of us receive several inquiries a day. Sometimes just answering them, much less having to pay the postage and buy envelopes, is a time-consuming, expensive task!
2. Should your inquiry be about Pagan/Craft folks in your area, tell about yourself, and how you came to have our names and wrote to us - after all the Inquisition is alive and sick here in the heart of the Bible Belt. Do not expect names and addresses unless they are already "public". Most of us, even the "public" Pagan/Craft folks prefer to meet people slowly and carefully over a cup of coffee in a public place, before we start introducing you to our groups and our friends. Why should we risk when you have risked nothing?
3. If you are invited to a gathering or festival, whether by written or oral invitation, before you invite others, get permission. Because of space, or other considerations, the number of people that can be accommodated might be limited, or certain individuals or groups may not be welcome because of personality conflicts and resulting disharmony. Also, if a weekend gathering is scheduled and you can only arrive for the ritual and then must leave, ask if that is OK...sometimes the ritual is the climax of the entire gathering, rather than an event in itself; in that case to show up only for the ritual not having been part of the entire event is to 'take-away' from the meaning of the whole for those who were there!
4. Always inquire what you should bring to any gathering. If you have received an official invitation, you should have been told. But, assume nothing! Ask if you need to bring food, robes, candles, drinks, eating utensils (forks, cups, plates, etc). It is unreasonable and rude to assume that an invitation to a gathering means that people just like yourselves, will expect you to come and eat their food, use their utensils and leave a mess for them to clean up after you have gone. If you cannot take food, then at least offer the gathering's sponsors a cash donation to help defray their cost. If you can't stay to help clean up afterwards, at least be considerate enough to get your own refuse to a garbage container.
5. To be invited to participate in another's ritual is NOT your right, but rather a privilege and an honor. If you are unfamiliar with their tradition, common courtesy demands that you at least inquire about enough information to participate in a positive fashion, and most certainly, make no assumptions about adding anything to the circle or placing your "special' crystals, totems, whatever in the circle or at a specific place within the circle without getting permission. Also, do not remove anything from a circle even should you feel it doesn't belong, without explaining why and getting permission.
6. It should not have to be said, but then neither should any of the above: If these Pagan/Craft rituals have no meaning in your life, and if you have just come for the fellowship, then enjoy the fellowship and please do not attend the ritual. The circle is a significant part of our entire way of life, not a reenactment of some past event just for the sake of the pageantry. When we can, we are pleased to share it with you, and we do so in Love and Light with Peace and Laughter.

IDEAS FROM MERLIN THE ENCHANTER
1. Be Yourself... if you worry about what others think, then you won't think for yourself... and if you don't think for yourself, you may as well be dead!
2. Allow all others to be themselves... just because Joe Blow from Kokomo has blue candles on his altar and you use only white ones, that doesn't mean he is the son of Satan. We must each one be allowed our own Pagan path in freedom, for if we cannot do that, then we have no freedom!
3. Let's stop all the silliness of who is and is not a Witch, and what one must do to be a witch.
4. Don't ask for someone's opinions unless you really want it! More Witch wars are started because someone asked for another's views and didn't like the answer they got!
5. Add a dose of good humor (the worst Witches are the ones that take everything so S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y!)

IDEAS FROM BEKET ASER EDITHSDATTER
It is necessary that we learn to be just plain adult about working together - or even, just existing on the same planet.
1. If you can't tolerate any slightest deviation from your own tradition, do not take part in public or cross-cultural rituals or gatherings.
2. If you have ideas of what should be in the ritual; or what should not - go to the planning meeting and express your opinions.
3. If you delegate a task to someone else - you have made it their job. The only thing you have to say is "Thank you". When and how they do it is their business so long as it is done at the moment it is required.
4. Appoint somebody to keep notes of the planning meetings - as things are said, not afterwards, or, inevitably, there will be disagreements about the ground rules.
5. Gossip: There are a few situations wherein it is legitimate to pass on "gossip". The following suggestions are not all inclusive but may serve to give guidelines for judging:
a. When a major life change definitely is occurring to someone with whom you and the person to whom you pass on the information - frequently work.
b. When you are acting as resource to help someone decrease a situation of disagreement.
c. When you really plan to take positive action to alleviate the situation the gossip refers to.
d. (This situation really does not occur all that often.) When warning someone about an individual whose practices are definitely undesirable for a reason other than that you don't like them.
e. When you have truly accurate information to counteract damaging and inaccurate rumor.
6. When examining a situation to decide whether or not you, yourself, are under psychic attack, be sure to ask yourself if it couldn't be because being under attack makes you feel important.
7. Within the group or group structure, the High Priest and or High Priestess are generally entitled to your respect and a certain amount of deference. If they really, really don't know as much as you do, perhaps it is time that you take a fond and friendly leave of them/him/her and begin a group of your own. Obviously, group or group affairs are appropriate subjects for discussion among all the members, and the HP/S definitely should be willing to listen to reasonable suggestions. However, you joined the group in order to learn from its leaders; a year or two of study probably doesn't qualify you to suddenly object to all their teachings, methods, and beliefs. Above all, it is inappropriate to try to stir up the whole group and "take over" the group. The leaders have put a good deal of time, patience, thought and teaching into building the group and giving it a good name - if you want to be Witch Queen of the Universe, start your own group from scratch and try to become good enough to earn status yourself. The goal is not big groups, it is the best possible groups. For group leaders: They need to be grown-up enough to know that every disagreement isn't necessarily a personal attack. They need to develop leadership skills to avoid confrontation and inflexibility. They need to know how to lead without dominating and they need an intense interest in the health of the group. The HP/S needs to listen to the ideas of the members and to use their ideas whenever possible. They should be able to explain rationally why certain ideas cannot be used.

Study of the Planetary Hours System by Andrew Kettle, 1994

Introduction:
Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so one of the questions that echoes across the valleys of the traditions is; "Are there too many cooks spoiling the broth?" As most witches are fervent independents, and self-assertively so, each will have a different approach and opinion to such a simple observation. Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of the many esoteric book shops. Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of existing wisdom, at times similar to looking through water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism, however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we stand?

Sample Text:
From "What witches do", Stewart Farrar, 1989, Phoenix Pub., Wash. p.174.
"Appendix 3. Planetary Hours. These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells which have planetary correspondences. Each day has a ruling planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are: Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw); Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday, Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation. Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesday's second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list is as follows:"

I have used Stewart Farrar's text only as an example of the commonly published, and accepted, planetary hour concept.

Part 2
Life and death are one, as the river and the sea are one. For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind, And to melt in the sun? What is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides That it may rise, and expand, and seek its Gods unencumbered? Only when you drink from the river of silence Shall you indeed sing. And when you have reached the mountaintop, Then shall you begin to climb. And when the Earth has claimed your limbs, then shall you truly dance.

(The following poem was written by my father - he says now that it is crude doggerel, but it speaks from his heart)
Vicki, Fate was most unkind,
Gave adult's body, but child's mind.
Yet from you so much love was spread
Everywhere you were seen to tread.
We'd like to think where'er you roam
In the new world you'll call your home,
There'll be no more pain, no more ills,
No more of this life's bitter pills.
Forgive us if today we're sad,
For we loved you so much - Mum and Dad.

Part 3
(This was read as the coffin was taken from the room used for the service to the crematorium)
Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am not there, I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow,
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am sun on ripened grain,
I am the gentle Autumn's rain.
When you wake in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry,
I am not there, I did not die.

Those who were at the service, Pagan, Christian, and agnostic alike, all felt that these words expressed the "right" things at the death of a much-loved person.
Blessed be
O C

... But to be born again, you must die

TO WICCEN OR NOT TO WICCEN......
by Vivienne West
Christians "christen" a child shortly after it comes into the world. Surely, then, it would make sense for Wiccans to "wiccen" a child at the same age - or even earlier.
I have an objection to the christening ceremony based on my fundamental belief in the right of the individual to make their own free choice. The christening ceremony, usually if not always performed on a person who is far too small to speak for themselves, condemns the child to at least nominal Christianity all their life. Their parents are sworn to raise the child as a Christian no matter how obviously unhappy that makes their offspring, and statements are made in ritual about the actual belief-system of the child. This is abhorrent to me: no one should ever make binding magical promises (and all rituals, even Christian ones, are magical) about someone who cannot speak for themselves and whose preferences are not known.
Now, I have read short articles in various Pagan magazines in the past (one in particular I remember, but Murphy has got to my mind, so I can remember neither the title nor the authors' names) in which people have laid out ritual events or scripts that do exactly the same thing, only in Wiccan terms instead of Christian ones. This, too, even as a Wiccan, I find distasteful. Once again, a person (even if they think of themself as a concerned, caring parent) is forcing their own belief-system and value-judgements on someone who is too young and helpless to speak for themself.
I do believe in celebrating the event of birth. Birth is a huge step: it is a statement about the individual's choice of environment and associates for up to the next hundred years or so. It marks the beginning of a period known as life, in which the individual is offered chances to grow and develop, as well as to experience pleasures and pain. Birth should be celebrated, and it is fitting to celebrate it in front of the Gods.
But even as a part of such celebration, do I have any right to insist that my infant child is going to grow up into being Wiccan? Obviously, as a Wiccan whose every aspect of life is influenced by my belief-system, I am going to teach my child about the Craft and try to instill a love of the Gods that I know and love. I am going to try to teach a love of the magical way of looking at the world, as opposed to the boring old way everyone else looks at things. Yet if my offspring, while knowing all they can about the Craft, decide it is not for them and some other path (or no path at all) is the only right and fitting way to live their life, then that is their decision. I have no right, even at this early stage, to condemn them to a lifetime of Wicca, no matter what.
On the other hand, though, as a caring parent I have every right and every emotional need to do whatever I can to protect and bless my child. I will definitely do a working when this infant I am carrying is born. This will be along the lines of an introduction or presentation of my child to the Old Ones, and an asking of their blessing and protection on him/her. It will not, however, be a ceremony formally inducting the child into Wicca. That can wait until such time as he/she expresses an interest in initiation.

This was originally a post by Song Bird in the Herbalism echo. I thought it was interesting enough to cross-post it to some of the magical echos.
Note to all: I apologize for the exceedingly lengthy nature of this post. My thought was that unless you, dear reader, have been following the posts on this topic, an edited response would be really obscure. And thank you, Song Bird, for this post to which I am responding.

I suppose I would say that theoretically any magic that can be worked
with ritual and/or tools can also be done without. The caveat with this
is that most of us (self included) don't have the skills, knowledge
and/or power to do without the ritual/tools for certain complicated
powerful working, IMHO. Though perhaps if we worked without tools or
ritual more often we'd get better at it... ;) Seriously, though, I'm
not advocating dropping the tools or ritual --- they're useful. And I
think it's better to do what's useful than to work until you're ninety
before you finally get good at it!
SB>Tools sometimes mean much more than just a focus, more than just a
SB>way to get to where you are going. Ofttimes the tools themselves are
SB>invested of the very life necessary to work the magic.
You're speaking here of tools which carry energy or intelligence, I
assume? I was referring to tools which are made by the worker or by
another worker for the purpose of someone else using them. In my
understanding tools are more useful if they carry energy or
intelligence. If they do, it's because the worker put it there. I
differentiate these from tools which acquire energy or intelligence
through a process other than human intervention.

It sounds to me like in that circumstance we are depriving ourselves of
the opportunity to work with another intelligence. When you use the word
"soul" I presume you mean "entity" as well, to which I attribute some
level of intelligence.
SB>Any tradition that believes in the vesting of power down through the

Not tools. The vesting of power and passing of knowledge is through (as
I comprehend it currently) the partnership of human and deity. As I see
it, the process of initiation (which many workers use, including all of
the shamanistic paths that I know anything about) does several things:
1) charters the individual with membership in the group with all the
rights and responsibilities involved thereof. 2) Passes power or
knowledge from the initiator to the initiate (sometimes the power or
knowledge is seen as coming from elsewhere, such as a deity). 3)
Formally introduces the initiate to the energy and/or deities of the
tradition. 4) Creates a new personality for the initiate which
sometimes supplants the old one. I'm sure there are points I've missed
and not all initiations do all these things.

She says:           Whose seeds lie in the dormancy of Death! The Priestess eats one of the seeds, saying:           I Taste the seeds of Death. The pomegranate is then passed hand to hand through the participants of the ritual, each eating a seed and saying to the next person, "Taste the seeds of Death." The Priestess then holds up the apple, saying: 2425           Behold the apple: fruit of wisdom, fruit of Death... She then cuts the apple crosswise, saying:           Whose symbolism rewards us with life eternal! She holds up the apple, displaying the inner pentagram, and says:           Behold the five-fold star - the promise of rebirth! Consecrate the fruit and wine.  Each person then tastes of the apple and sips the wine, saying to the next person:           Taste the fruit of rebirth and sip from the cup           of wine of Life. After libation, the Priestess presents each member of the group with a small pot of earth, planted with three seeds [preferably rue or lavendar].  She briefly explains to the group that this is the season of the seed - it is a time of dormancy, but also a time of re-generation for growth.  Further, as the seed rests in the earth, they should also take time to rest and re-evaluate their lives, metaphorically planting only those values which will enrich and enhance the growth within the Divine Self.  She then instructs them to name the seeds within their pots with three values they wish to incorporate into their lives, knowing that as the seeds sprout with new life, their lives will be new, as well.

Physicists currently interpret physical creation, that is, the universe as we know it, as having occurred within a time span o about three minutes...the "Big Bang."  Our physical universe is thought to have been created with the explosion of a hyper-dense particle which contained every bit of matter and energy that now exists in the universe, including the matter which forms our living bodies as we meet here today.  This hyper-dense super molecule also is thought to have been quite small.  Dr. Leon Friedman, director of the FermiLab near Chicago, has indicated it may have ben no larger than a basket ball.  Into this "ball" was jammed all matter and all energy in our universe.  It remained there until some creative force, some creative urge, disrupted the status of this primal "egg" and set into being the universe as we know it.  this event occurred with the so-called "Big Bang," echoes of which have been detected by scientific instruments. Our interpretation of the nature of this creative force or creative urge is opposed to that of Judeo-Christianity in that we perceive it as feminine...they see it as masculine.  We hold that pre-creation was feminine and this divergence in concept of first Things, creation, forever separates our Neopagan world-view from the Judeo-Christians.  Briefly consider this, and you may want to dwell upon it later, our Goddess, of Her own will, receives Her consort, the God whom she created, and from Their union our creation is ever revived and sustained.  The Christian reviver and sustainer, on the other hand, was conceived in a most singular manner.  The omnipotent God sent a neuter third party messenger, and angel, to announce to a virgin that she was pregnant with the child, Jesus.  So there.  Zap!  What a put-down!  What revival and sustenance can we find in such a sterile and asexual concept?  Even masculine old Zeus copulated with human females so at least somebody got some fun out of the process!  What we Neopagans find difficult to understand is why Judeo-Christianity so vehemently turned its back on sex and not just sex as a physical act but also sex as a gender, specifically, sex as a feminine gender. When we seek to deal with Creation we also must situate our place as human beings within the totality of Creation.  The orthodox Judeo-Christian view gives humans a special place within Creation; that is, that we are not part of general creation but a special creation..."Man was created in the image of God"...and the rest of creation is our plaything..."Yours is the earth and everything on it."  There is no need to expound upon our rejection of these two fundamental points:  of course we are not created in any special way, any more than is a rock or a tree or a raccoon or a galaxy, nor do we have dominion over anything.  We are a part of general creation along with every other particle of matter in the universe. I hope you grasp the vast difference this makes; it forever separates us from the Judeo-Christian heritage and it s a gulf 2427 that cannot be bridged.  They must forever consider themselves special and we must forever consider ourselves general and one with creation.  And it is given to us to look at a grain of sand and in that grain see the sum total of creation and to see ourselves as part of it and to gibe thanks for the creative force of the Goddess and Her consort that sustains this creation. CHAOS... With Chaos, as with so many other concepts, we must think on at least two levels, the physical and the mythical, to come to any sort of understanding of ourselves and what we really believe about our place in creation.  And it is this belief, this understanding that is the ultimate determination of how we live as human beings upon this beautiful Earth.  That is what we Neopagans are trying to do right now:  learn to think differently that Western man has thought in nearly two-thousand years in order that we may live in a renewed relationship with creation. It is an exciting adventure. Before there was form, there was Chaos.  We may well suppose Chaos represents the disordered formlessness of matter and energy in that initial "Big Bang" of the primordial egg in those first three minutes when creation began.  Mythologically, we see this formlessness as before the Earth and Sky were separated, as before the four elements, actually the four states of matter, had coalesced into their separate forms.  The myths speak darkly of this time, of the births of the Titans, Cyclops and 100-handed monsters, of a father who devours his own young...what better way to represent Chaos! We may assume, too, we have our own dark and personal counterpart to this primal Chaos.  Is it that black win that whips at the raveled edge o sanity?  I believe our ancestors felt far more keenly than we can understand in this present age a constant fear that what order they had managed to being to their lives, indeed, what order they could see in creation around them, would suddenly collapse and they would be plunged into chaos and madness.  Greek myths are redolent with stories of madness and possession.  Even great Heracles fell victim.  It is no wonder, then,The Church of All Worlds offers a religious position uniquely suited to the enlightened, inquiring modern mind. In harmony with the principles and conclusions of science, receptive to the values and wisdom of the ancients and the great religions of humanity, sensitive to the deep psychological and spiritual needs of all people, the Church of All Worlds aspires to be the kind of free, growing, and unifying religion that today's and tomorrow's world so urgently needs.

The Church of All Worlds is Neo-Pagan: a modern Earth Religion—an orientation chosen because of its traditional associations with Life and the processes of Nature, which we consider an appropriate religious orientation for the emerging Aquarian Age. As Western civilization has been to a great degree the product of the past two thousand years of Piscean Age Christianity, so do we envision a new whole-Earth culture of transformative religious ecology to become the product of the next epoch of Aquarian Age Neo-Paganism.

In common with many other Neo-Pagan religions, CAW presents a life-affirming religious philosophy for the joyous unification of eros, ethos, and ecos; of cult, culture, and cultivation. We consider the Church of All Worlds to be radically evolutionary in concept, rather than revolutionary.The evolution of life on Earth is moving towards a point of actualization where the entire planet will share a single vast global consciousness. Humanity is instrumental in this evolution. As humans can disrupt entire ecosystems, it is our responsibility to prevent such disruptions. We are not anti-technology or science, recognizing that advances in ecology, geology, astronomy, psychology, archaeology, cybernetics, astrophysics, communications, and bio-renaissance technology can be positively evolutionary and in harmony with planetary consciousness. We oppose the senseless use of industrial technology that harms the ecosystem, often justified by the Biblical injunction of dominion over the Earth. We perceive our role not as dominion but as responsible stewardship.

Applying evolutionary concepts to individuals, we agree with Erich Fromm that the purpose of life is "to become what we potentially are." We identify with the concepts of human self-actualization identified by Abraham Maslow and found in transpersonal psychology and ethics. Rejecting predestination and inherent sin, we affirm the ultimate freedom and responsibility appropriate to conscious entities, expressed in the phrase "Thou Art God/dess," derived from Robert Heinlein's novel, 'Stranger in a Strange Land.' This implies that each one of us must define our own specific purpose, with no excuse or shelter from the awesome responsibility of total freedom.

Recognizing that all life on Earth comprises a single vast living entity, conceptualized as feminine from time immemorial, we are in harmony with our Pagan ancestors who worshipped The Goddess: Mother Earth, Mother Nature. We affirm the pantheistic conceptualization of immanent divinity inherent in all living entities, as synergic living Nature. We define divinity as the highest level of aware consciousness accessible to each living being, manifesting in the self-actualization of that being. Hence, "Thou Art God/dess" applies equally to a person, a tree, a grasshopper, or a planet.

As Neo-Pagans, we are concerned with life after birth, not life after death. We have no dogmas of immortality, considering that whatever one believes about an afterlife may very well be what one gets. We view death as an evolutionary prerequisite for the emergence of new life, returning the dead to the Earth for recycling into other life forms. Other than our ecological responsibility of returning to the Earth what we have taken from Her, we are not concerned with dying but with living. We are deeply concerned with improving the quality of life, agreeing with population ecologists that its quantity must be drastically reduced. Thus, we support various birth control measures, including the full legalization of abortion, fearing that if humanity does not limit its numbers by reducing births, Nature will do it for us by increasing deaths.

WHERE WE'RE GOING: The word 'Religion' means "re-linking." The basic commitment of the Church of All Worlds is to the reintegration of people with themselves, their fellow humans, and the whole of living Nature. We create no artificial demarcations between the sacred and the secular, recognizing that religion must ultimately be an entire way of life. We are committed to developing an organic, vitalistic philosophy of life and its expression in an organic culture.

To this end, the Church of All Worlds devotes itself to those who need or want help and understanding through the processes of unlearning and learning. We aim to offer assistance through any effective personal expansion programs. We intend to remain open-minded and receptive to new ideas, interests, and goals, learning to live responsibly and responsively with each other. We advocate involvement with every conceivable aspect of the emerging Gaian culture, from religious service and mythology to family relations and child-rearing; from education to ecology; from psychic development to space travel; from the sensual to the sexual; from intentional communities to planetary government and world peace. "Nothing short of everything will ever really do."

We are engaged in the eclectic reconstruction of ancient Nature religions, combining archetypes of many cultures with other mystic and spiritual disciplines. We are not just trying to recreate a Paradise Lost; we are actively working to actualize a visionary future. With roots deep in the Earth and branches reaching towards the stars, we evoke and create myths not only of a Golden Age long past but also of one yet to come.

Since we are concerned with the emergent evolution of a new culture and lifestyle, and perceive no distinction between the sacred and the secular, we consider every activity to be essentially a religious activity. For us, taking our cans and bottles to the recycling center is as much a religious duty as prayer and meditation. So are composting our garbage, growing organic vegetables, practicing birth control, using biodegradable products, boycotting tuna, training and study, protecting animals, and celebrating the seasons. We recognize that the essence of a religion is in the living of it.As the ceremony concludes, you slowly open your eyes.

Libation:
"To thee we return this portion of thy bounty, o NAME our Mother, even as we must someday return unto thee."

Final Benediction:
"Let us go out into the world, secure in the knowledge that our sacrifices have pleased the Gods and Goddesses, and that we go forth upon the Earth under their protection. We have finished this ceremony! So be it! Biodh se!"

Recessional song/chant: Walk with Wisdom
Walk with wisdom from this hallowed place.
Walk not in sorrow, our roots shall ere embrace.
May Strength be your brother, and Honor be your friend.
and Luck be your lover until we meet again.

PAGAN MANNERS OR Are There Any Dead Animals in The Soup? by Grey Cat, Members Advocate

I can hear the outraged screams already. There are people out there who believe that the very idea of "Pagan Manners" is a conflict in terms; that "manners" are outdated, dishonest and hypocritical. Well, think again. Manners constitute the only successful technique ever discovered by humankind to enable groups and individuals, holding moderately disparate views, customs or beliefs, to get along together. There are things more important than manners; but, without manners, it's unlikely that a discussion will ever go to them. Pagan manners are fairly simple and have nothing to do with which fork you use or how to word an invitation. They have to do with respect for others' feelings and beliefs. They most specifically have to do with recognition of the fact that you should "judge not the path of your brother or sister for their path is sacred." Manners are also the only way of attempting to grant everyone the personal space which each of us needs. There have been a number of attempts to write down a list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots" which will cover Pagan life. Here are several tries made by four different people:

MY OWN OPINIONS
1. Never assume that you are invited to a ritual or a non-public gathering just because your friend is invited. Have your friend call the group doing the event and ASK! (or call yourself).
2. When participating in a ritual led by a group of which you are not a member, ask ahead of time what will be done. Should there be something in the explanation, or in the set-up of the ritual area which bothers you, just quietly don't participate in the ritual.
3. Ask the person(s) officiating at a ritual before you place anything in the ritual area; wear clothing or tools which might be considered unusual; or add private energy workings to the ritual being done.
4. Never just walk out of a cast ritual circle. Ask someone in the group sponsoring the ritual to cut you a door if you really and truly absolutely have to leave.
5. Don't make comments on the ritual, its leaders or the amount or quality of the energy raised during the ritual unless such opinions are asked for by the leaders. Save it for your friends, privately, after the ritual is over.
6. Vegetarians, Vegans, Strict Carnivores, Diabetics, and any others with very strong food preferences: no one minds your asking quietly and politely "Which dishes have meat (sugar, spices, hot pepper, etc.) in them?" When planning a meal for mixed Pagan/Wiccan groups, it is strongly suggested that at least some of the dishes be vegetarian, sugar-free, relatively non-spicy etc. At all times, within and without the ritual context, always provide an alternative to alcoholic beverages.
7. While many people have become far less secretive about their membership in a Pagan group, it is never, EVER, permissible to "blow someone's cover". Do not ever call a friend or acquaintance by their Pagan name or mention their membership in a mundane situation. It is also bad manners - and a symptom of social climbing - to call an individual by his/her mundane name in a Pagan situation. It always reminds me of an extra calling John Wayne "The Duke" at a local bar.
8. Whether you drink, take drugs or indulge in other similar behavior is completely your own business. It is always wrong to urge such behavior on any other individual. The majority of serious Pagan groups absolutely do NOT allow anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol to participate in ritual. Do not be offended if you are turned away for this reason. If you are taking a psycho-active drug for a medical reason it is very wise to check with the ritual leader(s) so they will understand and can advise you if they feel the ritual might be harmful to you.
9. Just because most Pagans/Wiccans are under 40 and in reasonably good physical condition, never assume that everyone is. Rituals and gatherings should be planned so that those with physical problems aren't barred totally from participation. Particularly in ritual, be aware that many more people than you might think are "mobility disabled." Group ritual should take place in an accessible area and some thought should be given to designating a safe place for those not taking part in dancing to stand or sit. Please be alert to anyone to whom help would be welcome. Help them to find a campsite which minimizes walking - to the ritual area, to the privies, to the eating area - whatever. Help them pitch their camp. Don't make them feel unwelcome - most handicapped people have worked extra hard on their magickal skills and may be able to add a great deal to the power in ritual and to the success of the gathering.
10. When at any sort of gathering, please be thoughtful. Particularly please observe true quiet after midnight. No one minds if you and others want to stay up all night talking or whatever. Everyone else minds a great deal if you stay up talking and laughing loudly and/or drumming. Those hosting a gathering should take the responsibility of keeping the noise level very low in at least some of the sleeping areas - and designating it as a quiet area.
11. Do not allow yourself to get the idea that you know the One True, Right and Only Path! Even if you really do have the conviction that what someone else is doing is "wrong", "incorrect", "Left-hand path" or whatever, just don't talk about it. It is perfectly permissible to refrain from participating in the activities of those with whom you cannot feel comfortable. It is not acceptable to express the idea that they "shouldn't" be doing it. This is not to say that if you know of criminal behavior on the part of a so-called Pagan/Wiccan group you should not report it. We must also be responsible for cleaning up our own act. Paganism is glorified by its diversity. Please do not allow yourself to express judgment by categories. Whether or not you like or dislike blacks, Indians, Homosexuals, women, men, or whatever, keep it to yourself! If you really and truly cannot feel comfortable taking part in a ritual which isn't conducted according to the tradition you follow or if you cannot be pleasant in company mixed with groups you disapprove of, please just stay home.

PAGAN/CRAFT ETIQUETTE by Soapbox Sam
Listed below are not hard and fast rules, but some helpful guidelines for those who would function smoothly in a craft/Pagan environment.
1. Should you write to someone for information, always enclose an SASE (Self-addressed, Stamped Envelope). Many of us receive several inquiries a day. Sometimes just answering them, much less having to pay the postage and buy envelopes, is a time-consuming, expensive task!
2. Should your inquiry be about Pagan/Craft folks in your area, tell about yourself, and how you came to have our names and wrote to us - after all the Inquisition is alive and sick here in the heart of the Bible Belt. Do not expect names and addresses unless they are already "public". Most of us, even the "public" Pagan/Craft folks prefer to meet people slowly and carefully over a cup of coffee in a public place, before we start introducing you to our groups and our friends. Why should we risk when you have risked nothing?
3. If you are invited to a gathering or festival, whether by written or oral invitation, before you invite others, get permission. Because of space, or other considerations, the number of people that can be accommodated might be limited, or certain individuals or groups may not be welcome because of personality conflicts and resulting disharmony. Also, if a weekend gathering is scheduled and you can only arrive for the ritual and then must leave, ask if that is OK...sometimes the ritual is the climax of the entire gathering, rather than an event in itself; in that case to show up only for the ritual not having been part of the entire event is to 'take-away' from the meaning of the whole for those who were there!
4. Always inquire what you should bring to any gathering. If you have received an official invitation, you should have been told. But, assume nothing! Ask if you need to bring food, robes, candles, drinks, eating utensils (forks, cups, plates, etc). It is unreasonable and rude to assume that an invitation to a gathering means that people just like yourselves, will expect you to come and eat their food, use their utensils and leave a mess for them to clean up after you have gone. If you cannot take food, then at least offer the gathering's sponsors a cash donation to help defray their cost. If you can't stay to help clean up afterwards, at least be considerate enough to get your own refuse to a garbage container.
5. To be invited to participate in another's ritual is NOT your right, but rather a privilege and an honor. If you are unfamiliar with their tradition, common courtesy demands that you at least inquire about enough information to participate in a positive fashion, and most certainly, make no assumptions about adding anything to the circle or placing your "special' crystals, totems, whatever in the circle or at a specific place within the circle without getting permission. Also, do not remove anything from a circle even should you feel it doesn't belong, without explaining why and getting permission.
6. It should not have to be said, but then neither should any of the above: If these Pagan/Craft rituals have no meaning in your life, and if you have just come for the fellowship, then enjoy the fellowship and please do not attend the ritual. The circle is a significant part of our entire way of life, not a reenactment of some past event just for the sake of the pageantry. When we can, we are pleased to share it with you, and we do so in Love and Light with Peace and Laughter.

IDEAS FROM MERLIN THE ENCHANTER
1. Be Yourself... if you worry about what others think, then you won't think for yourself... and if you don't think for yourself, you may as well be dead!
2. Allow all others to be themselves... just because Joe Blow from Kokomo has blue candles on his altar and you use only white ones, that doesn't mean he is the son of Satan. We must each one be allowed our own Pagan path in freedom, for if we cannot do that, then we have no freedom!
3. Let's stop all the silliness of who is and is not a Witch, and what one must do to be a witch.
4. Don't ask for someone's opinions unless you really want it! More Witch wars are started because someone asked for another's views and didn't like the answer they got!
5. Add a dose of good humor (the worst Witches are the ones that take everything so S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y!)

IDEAS FROM BEKET ASER EDITHSDATTER
It is necessary that we learn to be just plain adult about working together - or even, just existing on the same planet.
1. If you can't tolerate any slightest deviation from your own tradition, do not take part in public or cross-cultural rituals or gatherings.
2. If you have ideas of what should be in the ritual; or what should not - go to the planning meeting and express your opinions.
3. If you delegate a task to someone else - you have made it their job. The only thing you have to say is "Thank you". When and how they do it is their business so long as it is done at the moment it is required.
4. Appoint somebody to keep notes of the planning meetings - as things are said, not afterwards, or, inevitably, there will be disagreements about the ground rules.
5. Gossip: There are a few situations wherein it is legitimate to pass on "gossip". The following suggestions are not all inclusive but may serve to give guidelines for judging:
a. When a major life change definitely is occurring to someone with whom you and the person to whom you pass on the information - frequently work.
b. When you are acting as resource to help someone decrease a situation of disagreement.
c. When you really plan to take positive action to alleviate the situation the gossip refers to.
d. (This situation really does not occur all that often.) When warning someone about an individual whose practices are definitely undesirable for a reason other than that you don't like them.
e. When you have truly accurate information to counteract damaging and inaccurate rumor.
6. When examining a situation to decide whether or not you, yourself, are under psychic attack, be sure to ask yourself if it couldn't be because being under attack makes you feel important.
7. Within the group or group structure, the High Priest and or High Priestess are generally entitled to your respect and a certain amount of deference. If they really, really don't know as much as you do, perhaps it is time that you take a fond and friendly leave of them/him/her and begin a group of your own. Obviously, group or group affairs are appropriate subjects for discussion among all the members, and the HP/S definitely should be willing to listen to reasonable suggestions. However, you joined the group in order to learn from its leaders; a year or two of study probably doesn't qualify you to suddenly object to all their teachings, methods, and beliefs. Above all, it is inappropriate to try to stir up the whole group and "take over" the group. The leaders have put a good deal of time, patience, thought and teaching into building the group and giving it a good name - if you want to be Witch Queen of the Universe, start your own group from scratch and try to become good enough to earn status yourself. The goal is not big groups, it is the best possible groups. For group leaders: They need to be grown-up enough to know that every disagreement isn't necessarily a personal attack. They need to develop leadership skills to avoid confrontation and inflexibility. They need to know how to lead without dominating and they need an intense interest in the health of the group. The HP/S needs to listen to the ideas of the members and to use their ideas whenever possible. They should be able to explain rationally why certain ideas cannot be used.

Study of the Planetary Hours System by Andrew Kettle, 1994

Introduction:
Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so one of the questions that echoes across the valleys of the traditions is; "Are there too many cooks spoiling the broth?" As most witches are fervent independents, and self-assertively so, each will have a different approach and opinion to such a simple observation. Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of the many esoteric book shops. Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of existing wisdom, at times similar to looking through water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism, however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we stand?

Sample Text:
From "What witches do", Stewart Farrar, 1989, Phoenix Pub., Wash. p.174.
"Appendix 3. Planetary Hours. These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells which have planetary correspondences. Each day has a ruling planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are: Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw); Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday, Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation. Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesday's second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list is as follows:"

Fears, regrets, sympathies, feelings of caring, and grievings are dealt with intensely. Adventure, patriotism, the joy of battle, etc. are ignored. The setting is outdoors in mid-morning light in a clearing among trees. There is a fire in the center of the temple space and an altar at the northernmost point of the circle. MARTIAL HONOR CEREMONY 1. Defining of the Temple Space and Time. All participants form into a circle as a drum beats slowly and steadily (about one beat per second). When the time comes to start, the HPS breaks from the circle and begins to define its outer limits with a sword. After she has just begun, the priest raises an old, rust-marked sword into the air -- this cues the first speakers. Alternating male and female voices call out (one from each quarter as the HPS passes): "Thermopylae!" "Gettysburg!" "Desert Storm!" "Uncounted thousands of battles! Uncounted thousands of wars!Mead: The Brew of the Gods!

Mead is the oldest alcoholic drink known to mankind. It has been a favorite in the Pagan and other alternative communities, such as the SCA, for years. It's a form of wine made with honey instead of grape juice. Mead is most often associated with the Vikings and in the Pagan community with modern-day Norse Paganism or Asatru. Mead is an important part of the Asatru religion and has a place in both of the major Norse rituals: the blot and the sumble. The sumble is a drinking ritual where stories, oaths, and poetry are shared, and mead's function here is obvious. In this day and age, mead is even more important to the blot or sacrifice ritual. The blot is actually quite simple. A God or Goddess is called upon, and a sacrifice is poured in their honor. In ancient times, this was most often an animal sacrifice, and blood was poured out onto the ground or altar. Today, an alcoholic beverage of some kind is the usual sacrifice. This is not only an adjustment to modern feelings about animal sacrifice but is appropriate from an esoteric point of view as well. In ancient times, the Norsemen were primarily farmers, and an animal would have been a product that they had raised. Also, sacrifices were not a wasting of the animal, merely given to the Gods and left to rot, but were usually feasts where the Gods got their portion and the humans their own. Today, mead making has been a frenzied activity among Norse Pagans, and it is most appropriate that something be sacrificed to the Gods which has been made by your own hands in a sacred manner. Mead fits the bill. It has immediate links to our farming ancestors, but it can be easily made from household items in even a small apartment. While we really don’t know a great deal about how the ancients viewed mead, other than as an intoxicant, we do have a few clues. One interesting item to start with is that mead was apparently sometimes strained through rye, which contains the hallucinogenic chemical ergot. This may offer some insights into Seidhr, a Nordic shamanic practice, and the frenzy of the berserkers. Another interesting item is that Frey, a God of farming and harvest, was said to have two close companions, Bygvir and Beyla. Bygvir was the spirit of the barley and Beyla of the honey—both important Gods to brewers and appropriate companions for the God of fertility. Finally, we have a few myths involving mead directly. Mead was known as Kvasir’s blood, and its primary association was with wisdom. Kvasir was a being who was the wisest in all the universe, but he was killed, and a mead created out of his blood that, when drank, brought the drinker wisdom. Aegir, a God of the Sea, was held to be the patron of brewing and the finest of mead and ale for the Gods to drink in Valhalla. Odin is said to never eat but to exist purely on mead, just as the Greek Gods had their nectar. Even if it were not for any mythological importance, mead is of interest to the modern brewer because it is easy to produce and delicious. One merely introduces yeast to the sugary liquid, and the yeast converts the natural sugars into alcohol. After all the sugar is converted, the yeast dies off, and the wine can be bottled. However, this is not always as easy as it sounds. The largest problem in brewing is keeping inappropriate yeasts out of the drink. While the correct wine (or beer) yeasts eat sugar and excrete alcohol, other yeasts produce vinegar instead. Because of this, it is absolutely vital to keep all brewing equipment absolutely sterile. This is the most important thing you can do in brewing. All the great equipment purchased at your wine-making shop and the finest ingredients cannot beat a glass jar filled with welfare honey if the former is contaminated and the latter sterile. There are two major ways to sterilize your materials: one is a commercial sanitizer found in wine-making shops. Follow label directions, and you’re all set. The other is to make a solution of 25% bleach and rinse very thoroughly. Let’s make some cheap and easy mead. You’ll need a large pot, a one-gallon vinegar or cider bottle, a 4' or 5' length of plastic tubing (try airline tubing from a pet shop), a balloon or non-lubricated condom, a package of wine yeast (not bread yeast), wine bottles, corks, a corking device, and 2 1/2 pounds of honey. First, you need to prepare the mixture that will be fermented. Take your pot and add the honey and enough water to finish filling up the one-gallon bottle. Bring these to a boil slowly. If you don’t want scum in your mead and it forms on the top, skim it off. You don’t need to boil it for any length of time; you just need to bring it up to this temperature. Boiling for a while will release a lot of scum and additives which you can get rid of right now, and it will also allow the mead to age more quickly. However, some of this scum, as I’ve called it, is made up of those very things which can create flavor nuances. I don’t boil mine. When you decide it’s done, let it cool long enough so it won’t melt the plastic tubing, then siphon the mead into the gallon jug, cap, and let cool overnight. The gallon jug is your primary fermenter. Did you sterilize the pot? The bottle? The cap? The plastic tubing? No! Pour it out and start again—yes, I am serious. Once the mixture is cooled to room temperature, you will need to pitch the yeast. Get a small cup half full with warm, but not hot, water and add the yeast. Let it sit for about ten minutes to absorb water and liven up, then pour it into your gallon jug and mix it in. As of now, your honey and water mixture is now being converted into mead. However, this will take about two weeks, perhaps more, to complete. During this time, the mead mixture will bubble and foam, and this is what the balloon is for. Cover the top of the bottle with the balloon, and about an hour later, when the balloon has started to inflate but has not become too stretched, poke a few holes in it with a pin. (I understand this may make you wince if you are using a condom.) This balloon takes the place of a fermentation lock and allows the gas to escape while not allowing air in, thus keeping the fermentation bottle sterile. The holes may become clogged with foam, and you may need to poke a few more. Just remember the purpose of this and use your common sense. I’ve accomplished this with plastic wrap and a rubber band, but I wouldn’t advise others to try unless you’re fond of unmet expectations. About two weeks from this point, the balloon will cease to be greatly inflated and will eventually go limp. When it has been completely limp for a few days and the mead is clear rather than cloudy, fermentation is over. At this point, sanitize your wine bottles and plastic tubing and bottle the mead. Be careful not to get the yeast into the bottles as it’s not exactly tasty stuff. I stop about an inch before the bottom of the primary fermenter and we siphon off the last inch into cups and toast the new mead. My mead has been very tasty at this point; other people describe theirs as tasting like paint thinner. In any case, you may not mind a little yeast in your cup now, but don’t inflict it on yourself in the future by bottling it. Wait two to six months and then enjoy. Since the above recipe has no additives which would hasten aging, it may take a while for it to become truly fine mead, perhaps years. There are a lot of chemical additives that one can use to improve the flavor and process. The most common and important addition is a teaspoon of yeast energizer or yeast nutrient. Others include grape tannin (1/4 teaspoon), malic acid (2 or 3 teaspoons), tartaric acid (1 to 2 teaspoons). I recommend all of these chemical additives in your first batch, but if you can’t find them, you can make do with natural ingredients or nothing at all. One can also add slices of fruit, raisins, or berries for flavor and in place of grape tannin. One recipe I know of adds some apple jelly. A few lemon peels will substitute for malic acid, and a spoonful of strong tea will replace tartaric acid. Hops are a common additive and will give the mead a bit of bitterness to offset the sweetness of the honey. The more bizarre ingredient I have heard of was Szechuan peppers; use your imagination. All of the above additives should be made to the honey and water mix when it is boiled. Depending on the ingredient, some, such as fruit, may have to be boiled in this mixture for a while to break them down. Obviously, hunks of fruit should be strained out after the boiling. Also, all the above ingredients are based on 1 gallon of mead; adjust appropriately with the exception of the yeast itself, one package of which will do for anywhere between 1 and 5 gallons. Another semi-useful item is sulfite tablets which can be added to the mead mixture a day before bottling. This will kill all remaining yeast and will assure that you are not contaminated by vinegar yeast after bottling or worse, that the fermentation process does not continue in the bottle, causing it to explode or pop its cork. I don’t use sulfite, and I’ve heard negative comments about a sulfurous aftertaste. It’s probably the better part of valor to simply wait a while longer and make sure the fermentation process is truly ended. The above instructions also assume you are not interested in spending a great deal of money on equipment. The only things you really must obtain from a wine-making store are the yeast, the corks, and the corker. If you are willing to spend $50 to $100 more, you can improve your chances of making a good mead by purchasing equipment made for the purpose. A balloon works, but it is a poor substitute for a proper fermentation lock that is custom fit to a vat built for the purpose. Likewise, there are many other devices which will be useful.Brown Jasper, because of the beautiful variations in coloring, is a type of Chalcedony. It is closely related to Quartz, with the chemistry of SiO2. The color variations are from trace amounts of other minerals, usually iron and aluminum. The hardness is 7.

ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in chemical sedimentary rocks.

OCCURRENCE: Montana, Utah, and Wyoming are prolific locations for Brown Jasper in the U.S. In addition, fine specimens have come from Brazil, Uruguay, and Egypt. Other colors and forms of Jasper are abundant in California, Texas, and Arkansas.

NAME: The name Chalcedony is from Chalcedon, an ancient Greek city of Asia Minor.

LEGEND and LORE: Beautiful Jasper, with light and dark brown markings, was referred to as "Egyptian Marble." Various Native American tribes used Jasper as a rubbing stone and some called it "the rain bringer."

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Brown Jasper is balancing and grounding. This stone, carved into an arrowhead, is worn to attract luck. It is a good stone to use after completing a ritual to help you regain your center and become grounded.

HEALING: Jasper is stabilizing. It will help to reduce insecurity, fear, and guilt.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use a piece of Montana Picture Jasper, which is mostly brown and tan with a slight bit of sky or navy blue, as a strong grounding stone for those who have an excess of energy at the Splenic Chakra. I've also used the stone as a basis for a "journey"... The stone looks like a scene of the Rocky Mountains. Finally, I've used Picture Jasper as a psychological tool: I will ask someone who is "looking for an answer" to gaze into the stone and describe all the symbols they see. Then I work with the client to form the "symbols" into some sort of answer.

NOTES: Agate, Jasper, Flint, Sardonyx, and Onyx are all forms of Chalcedony. In addition, particular colors of Chalcedony have specific names, such as Heliotrope, Bloodstone, Chrysoprase, and Moss Agate.The seasonal cycle follows the agricultural and solar cycle of the year. We have eight major festivals. The first, and possibly the most important, is Samhain, commonly known as Halloween, and is thought to have been the time when the ancient Celts celebrated the new year. It was the end of one agricultural year and the beginning of the next. It was the final onset of Winter and a festival of the dead. The modern concept of ghosts and ghouls stems directly from the Celtic feast of the dead. This is not about summoning spirits for evil purposes but reflecting on the memories of lost loved ones and gaining insight into one's own life from their lessons. Even in its Christianized form, Halloween, or All Hallows Eve, is still a festival of the dead.

The mid-Winter Solstice is Yule, an Anglo-Saxon word whose meaning is now forgotten. It has been suggested that it could mean 'wheel,' and within a Pagan or Wiccan context, the year is often referred to as "the wheel of the year." Yule celebrates the re-birth of the Sun. Christians adopted this festival to mark the birth of Christ, although historical evidence suggests Christ was born in March or September. Imbolc, Christianized as Candlemas, represents the first stirring of Spring and the gradual return of light. The Spring Equinox, associated with Easter, is when the earth comes back to life. Easter is a moveable feast set on the first Sunday after the first full Moon after the Spring Equinox. The name "Easter" comes from the Anglo-Saxon fertility Goddess "Eostre," and many traditional Easter items like eggs and rabbits are derived from Pagan symbols.

Beltane is the only Pagan holiday without a Christian counterpart, likely due to its overtly sexual nature. Children conceived at Beltane were often born around Imbolc, which is lambing time. Ewe's milk was important in the past to strengthen children for the last part of Winter and to help them grow through Spring and Summer. The Summer Solstice, mid-Summer, represents the Sun at its height. Solstices and Equinoxes are solar festivals, symbolizing the union of Sun and Earth to produce the harvest. Lugnassadh, or Lammas, marks the start of the harvest. The Autumn equinox is the harvest festival, a time to rest after the harvest has been collected. Then we return to Samhain, or Halloween. 

Rituals and ceremonies vary from group to group or individual to individual but generally consist of symbolic 'drama' reflecting the world around us and the roles of Pagan or Witchcraft deities. Spiritualism plays little part in Wicca; it is not something to be played around with. We invoke the spirit of a particular God or Goddess to imbibe us with their power and insight, which is an intensely psychological process. Magic in Witchcraft is closely associated with the use of mind over matter, similar to prayer. Witches seek the attention of a particular God or Goddess to assist in their desires, using items of equipment and paraphernalia as psychological props to focus their minds. Magic is a neutral force, and its use depends on the individual's intentions. Most Witches consider the implications of their actions and avoid harmful magic. The Craft has two main "laws": "An it harm none, do what thou will" and the "Law of Threefold Return," meaning the result of an act will reflect on the instigator threefold.

The suggestion of an organized conspiracy of Satanic child abuse is a myth created by Christian extremists. While some perverts may use the occult as a cover for abuse, they are not Witches. Associating Wicca with child abuse is irresponsible and can provoke a lynch mob mentality. Abuse is contrary to everything Witches hold dear. Our children are our future, and abusing them risks turning them into abusers. We seek acceptance to practice our beliefs in harmony with others. We do not seek to impose our values on anyone. The individual has the right to choose their form of religion and how they perceive their God. Many conflicts in the world have a religious basis, and imposing one's religious will on another is wrong. We do not seek converts but wish to be left in peace to practice our beliefs. We believe that working together with others, despite different paths, can achieve a world that lives in peace. Each religion professes a love of humanity and the world, and we should work towards a greater good. There is no one true way; each person must find their own path to God. We believe the world could be better if people stopped trying to impose their will on others. We wish to move forward with others to a better world.The desires of the body and ego. Since many such desires are impulsive and destructive, the COS found itself in an awkward position, which accelerated its eventual crisis and demise in 1975. The Temple of Set determined to preserve the principle of individualism but to add to it the evolutionary "higher self" aspirations of Aleister Crowley's pre-OTO philosophy of Thelema. Glorification of the ego is not enough; it is the COMPLETE psyche, the entire Self or soul, which must be recognized, appreciated, and actualized. Dogma, including fixed ideology in any form, is repugnant to Setians. We strive rather towards an atmosphere of "best possible premises," which are always subject to constructive, intelligent examination and criticism. Foolish, pretentious, or destructive egotism under the guise of exploration is neither respected nor endured. Regretfully, there still exist some individuals whose idea of "Satanism" is largely a simple-minded synthesis of Christian propaganda and Hollywood horror movies. The Temple of Set enjoys the colorful legacy of the Black Arts, and we use many forms of historical Satanic imagery for our artistic stimulation and pleasure. But we have not found that any interest or activity which an enlightened, mature intellect would regard as undignified, sadistic, criminal, or depraved is desirable, much less essential to our work. The Temple of Set is an evolutionary product of human experience. Such experience includes the magical and philosophical work of many occult individuals who have preceded us. In examining the secret and suppressed corners of history for valuable and useful material, the Temple insists upon ethical presentation and use of such discoveries. All Setians are expected to display a high measure of maturity and common sense in this area. We reject absolutely wanton cruelty and harm to others and are particularly adamant about this with regard to animals. The Temple of Set evaluates conventional religions as erroneous in principle and feels no need to concern itself with their activities unless they intrude upon our affairs. Any further questions or comments are welcome.Fidelity is a word that is far too often defined by its narrow use in terms of marital fidelity. By the dictionary, it simply means being faithful to someone or something. In marriage, this means being true to one's vows and partner, and this has been narrowly defined as limiting one's sexual experience to one's spouse. While I have found this to be great practical advice, many treat fidelity as if there were no other ways in which one could be faithful or unfaithful. For Asatruar, fidelity is most important in terms of our faith and troth to the Gods. We must remain true to the Aesir and Vanir and to our kinsmen. Like marriage, Profession (the rite in which one enters the Asatru faith, similar to Christian confirmation or Wiccan initiation) is a sacred bond between two parties; in this case, an Asatruar and the Gods. In order for such a relationship to work, both must be honest and faithful to each other. Asatru, although currently being reborn, is at its roots a folk religion, and we also uphold the value of fidelity to the ways of our ancestors. This is why historical research is so important to the Asatru-folk: it is the rediscovering of our ancient ways and our readoption of them. Discipline in any discussion of the values of Asatru is best described as self-discipline. It is the exercise of personal will that upholds honor and the other virtues and translates impulse into action. If one is to be able to reject moral legalism for a system of internal honor, one must be willing to exercise the self-discipline necessary to make it work. Going back to my earlier criticism of society, if one rejects legalism, one must be willing to control one's own actions. Without self-discipline, we have the mess we currently see in our culture. Looking at discipline in terms of fidelity, we see a close connection. Many Pagans go from faith to faith, system to system, path to path. Asatruar are much less likely to do this. The discipline of keeping faith with our Gods and the ways of our ancestors is part of our modern practice. In this way, we limit ourselves in some ways, but we gain much more in others.The Temple Ov Psychick Youth emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and the release of the sexual spirit to free emotions from dogma and external control. This process is a personal journey where the Temple acts as a guide, providing support and a platform for sharing ideas. The Temple is seen as a living organism, growing and evolving with its members, much like a biological entity within an ecosystem. It aims to challenge and potentially overturn the preconceived ideas of Western society, likening its influence to that of a virus or cancer cell capable of significant impact.

Critics of the Temple often misunderstand its goals, which include supporting individuality, offering no dogma, and promoting self-realization. The Temple encourages thinking and spreading freedom, particularly in the realm of sexuality, which it views as a powerful and natural force free from guilt. The Psychick Cross and the number 23 are symbols within the Temple, representing various aspects of its philosophy and serving as focal points for energy and personal growth.

The Temple's members are united in their differences, each on a personal journey towards self-discovery and fulfillment. They reject societal norms and limitations, aiming to live fully and authentically.

PAGAN MANNERS OR Are There Any Dead Animals in The Soup? by Grey Cat, Members Advocate

I can hear the outraged screams already. There are people out there who believe that the very idea of "Pagan Manners" is a conflict in terms; that "manners" are outdated, dishonest and hypocritical. Well, think again. Manners constitute the only successful technique ever discovered by humankind to enable groups and individuals, holding moderately disparate views, customs or beliefs, to get along together. There are things more important than manners; but, without manners, it's unlikely that a discussion will ever go to them. Pagan manners are fairly simple and have nothing to do with which fork you use or how to word an invitation. They have to do with respect for others' feelings and beliefs. They most specifically have to do with recognition of the fact that you should "judge not the path of your brother or sister for their path is sacred." Manners are also the only way of attempting to grant everyone the personal space which each of us needs. There have been a number of attempts to write down a list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots" which will cover Pagan life. Here are several tries made by four different people:

MY OWN OPINIONS
1. Never assume that you are invited to a ritual or a non-public gathering just because your friend is invited. Have your friend call the group doing the event and ASK! (or call yourself).
2. When participating in a ritual led by a group of which you are not a member, ask ahead of time what will be done. Should there be something in the explanation, or in the set-up of the ritual area which bothers you, just quietly don't participate in the ritual.
3. Ask the person(s) officiating at a ritual before you place anything in the ritual area; wear clothing or tools which might be considered unusual; or add private energy workings to the ritual being done.
4. Never just walk out of a cast ritual circle. Ask someone in the group sponsoring the ritual to cut you a door if you really and truly absolutely have to leave.
5. Don't make comments on the ritual, its leaders or the amount or quality of the energy raised during the ritual unless such opinions are asked for by the leaders. Save it for your friends, privately, after the ritual is over.
6. Vegetarians, Vegans, Strict Carnivores, Diabetics, and any others with very strong food preferences: no one minds your asking quietly and politely "Which dishes have meat (sugar, spices, hot pepper, etc.) in them?" When planning a meal for mixed Pagan/Wiccan groups, it is strongly suggested that at least some of the dishes be vegetarian, sugar-free, relatively non-spicy etc. At all times, within and without the ritual context, always provide an alternative to alcoholic beverages.
7. While many people have become far less secretive about their membership in a Pagan group, it is never, EVER, permissible to "blow someone's cover". Do not ever call a friend or acquaintance by their Pagan name or mention their membership in a mundane situation. It is also bad manners - and a symptom of social climbing - to call an individual by his/her mundane name in a Pagan situation. It always reminds me of an extra calling John Wayne "The Duke" at a local bar.
8. Whether you drink, take drugs or indulge in other similar behavior is completely your own business. It is always wrong to urge such behavior on any other individual. The majority of serious Pagan groups absolutely do NOT allow anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol to participate in ritual. Do not be offended if you are turned away for this reason. If you are taking a psycho-active drug for a medical reason it is very wise to check with the ritual leader(s) so they will understand and can advise you if they feel the ritual might be harmful to you.
9. Just because most Pagans/Wiccans are under 40 and in reasonably good physical condition, never assume that everyone is. Rituals and gatherings should be planned so that those with physical problems aren't barred totally from participation. Particularly in ritual, be aware that many more people than you might think are "mobility disabled." Group ritual should take place in an accessible area and some thought should be given to designating a safe place for those not taking part in dancing to stand or sit. Please be alert to anyone to whom help would be welcome. Help them to find a campsite which minimizes walking - to the ritual area, to the privies, to the eating area - whatever. Help them pitch their camp. Don't make them feel unwelcome - most handicapped people have worked extra hard on their magickal skills and may be able to add a great deal to the power in ritual and to the success of the gathering.
10. When at any sort of gathering, please be thoughtful. Particularly please observe true quiet after midnight. No one minds if you and others want to stay up all night talking or whatever. Everyone else minds a great deal if you stay up talking and laughing loudly and/or drumming. Those hosting a gathering should take the responsibility of keeping the noise level very low in at least some of the sleeping areas - and designating it as a quiet area.
11. Do not allow yourself to get the idea that you know the One True, Right and Only Path! Even if you really do have the conviction that what someone else is doing is "wrong", "incorrect", "Left-hand path" or whatever, just don't talk about it. It is perfectly permissible to refrain from participating in the activities of those with whom you cannot feel comfortable. It is not acceptable to express the idea that they "shouldn't" be doing it. This is not to say that if you know of criminal behavior on the part of a so-called Pagan/Wiccan group you should not report it. We must also be responsible for cleaning up our own act. Paganism is glorified by its diversity. Please do not allow yourself to express judgment by categories. Whether or not you like or dislike blacks, Indians, Homosexuals, women, men, or whatever, keep it to yourself! If you really and truly cannot feel comfortable taking part in a ritual which isn't conducted according to the tradition you follow or if you cannot be pleasant in company mixed with groups you disapprove of, please just stay home.

PAGAN/CRAFT ETIQUETTE by Soapbox Sam
Listed below are not hard and fast rules, but some helpful guidelines for those who would function smoothly in a craft/Pagan environment.
1. Should you write to someone for information, always enclose an SASE (Self-addressed, Stamped Envelope). Many of us receive several inquiries a day. Sometimes just answering them, much less having to pay the postage and buy envelopes, is a time-consuming, expensive task!
2. Should your inquiry be about Pagan/Craft folks in your area, tell about yourself, and how you came to have our names and wrote to us - after all the Inquisition is alive and sick here in the heart of the Bible Belt. Do not expect names and addresses unless they are already "public". Most of us, even the "public" Pagan/Craft folks prefer to meet people slowly and carefully over a cup of coffee in a public place, before we start introducing you to our groups and our friends. Why should we risk when you have risked nothing?
3. If you are invited to a gathering or festival, whether by written or oral invitation, before you invite others, get permission. Because of space, or other considerations, the number of people that can be accommodated might be limited, or certain individuals or groups may not be welcome because of personality conflicts and resulting disharmony. Also, if a weekend gathering is scheduled and you can only arrive for the ritual and then must leave, ask if that is OK...sometimes the ritual is the climax of the entire gathering, rather than an event in itself; in that case to show up only for the ritual not having been part of the entire event is to 'take-away' from the meaning of the whole for those who were there!
4. Always inquire what you should bring to any gathering. If you have received an official invitation, you should have been told. But, assume nothing! Ask if you need to bring food, robes, candles, drinks, eating utensils (forks, cups, plates, etc). It is unreasonable and rude to assume that an invitation to a gathering means that people just like yourselves, will expect you to come and eat their food, use their utensils and leave a mess for them to clean up after you have gone. If you cannot take food, then at least offer the gathering's sponsors a cash donation to help defray their cost. If you can't stay to help clean up afterwards, at least be considerate enough to get your own refuse to a garbage container.
5. To be invited to participate in another's ritual is NOT your right, but rather a privilege and an honor. If you are unfamiliar with their tradition, common courtesy demands that you at least inquire about enough information to participate in a positive fashion, and most certainly, make no assumptions about adding anything to the circle or placing your "special' crystals, totems, whatever in the circle or at a specific place within the circle without getting permission. Also, do not remove anything from a circle even should you feel it doesn't belong, without explaining why and getting permission.
6. It should not have to be said, but then neither should any of the above: If these Pagan/Craft rituals have no meaning in your life, and if you have just come for the fellowship, then enjoy the fellowship and please do not attend the ritual. The circle is a significant part of our entire way of life, not a reenactment of some past event just for the sake of the pageantry. When we can, we are pleased to share it with you, and we do so in Love and Light with Peace and Laughter.

IDEAS FROM MERLIN THE ENCHANTER
1. Be Yourself... if you worry about what others think, then you won't think for yourself... and if you don't think for yourself, you may as well be dead!
2. Allow all others to be themselves... just because Joe Blow from Kokomo has blue candles on his altar and you use only white ones, that doesn't mean he is the son of Satan. We must each one be allowed our own Pagan path in freedom, for if we cannot do that, then we have no freedom!
3. Let's stop all the silliness of who is and is not a Witch, and what one must do to be a witch.
4. Don't ask for someone's opinions unless you really want it! More Witch wars are started because someone asked for another's views and didn't like the answer they got!
5. Add a dose of good humor (the worst Witches are the ones that take everything so S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y!)

IDEAS FROM BEKET ASER EDITHSDATTER
It is necessary that we learn to be just plain adult about working together - or even, just existing on the same planet.
1. If you can't tolerate any slightest deviation from your own tradition, do not take part in public or cross-cultural rituals or gatherings.
2. If you have ideas of what should be in the ritual; or what should not - go to the planning meeting and express your opinions.
3. If you delegate a task to someone else - you have made it their job. The only thing you have to say is "Thank you". When and how they do it is their business so long as it is done at the moment it is required.
4. Appoint somebody to keep notes of the planning meetings - as things are said, not afterwards, or, inevitably, there will be disagreements about the ground rules.
5. Gossip: There are a few situations wherein it is legitimate to pass on "gossip". The following suggestions are not all inclusive but may serve to give guidelines for judging:
a. When a major life change definitely is occurring to someone with whom you and the person to whom you pass on the information - frequently work.
b. When you are acting as resource to help someone decrease a situation of disagreement.
c. When you really plan to take positive action to alleviate the situation the gossip refers to.
d. (This situation really does not occur all that often.) When warning someone about an individual whose practices are definitely undesirable for a reason other than that you don't like them.
e. When you have truly accurate information to counteract damaging and inaccurate rumor.
6. When examining a situation to decide whether or not you, yourself, are under psychic attack, be sure to ask yourself if it couldn't be because being under attack makes you feel important.
7. Within the group or group structure, the High Priest and or High Priestess are generally entitled to your respect and a certain amount of deference. If they really, really don't know as much as you do, perhaps it is time that you take a fond and friendly leave of them/him/her and begin a group of your own. Obviously, group or group affairs are appropriate subjects for discussion among all the members, and the HP/S definitely should be willing to listen to reasonable suggestions. However, you joined the group in order to learn from its leaders; a year or two of study probably doesn't qualify you to suddenly object to all their teachings, methods, and beliefs. Above all, it is inappropriate to try to stir up the whole group and "take over" the group. The leaders have put a good deal of time, patience, thought and teaching into building the group and giving it a good name - if you want to be Witch Queen of the Universe, start your own group from scratch and try to become good enough to earn status yourself. The goal is not big groups, it is the best possible groups. For group leaders: They need to be grown-up enough to know that every disagreement isn't necessarily a personal attack. They need to develop leadership skills to avoid confrontation and inflexibility. They need to know how to lead without dominating and they need an intense interest in the health of the group. The HP/S needs to listen to the ideas of the members and to use their ideas whenever possible. They should be able to explain rationally why certain ideas cannot be used.

Study of the Planetary Hours System by Andrew Kettle, 1994

Introduction:
Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so one of the questions that echoes across the valleys of the traditions is; "Are there too many cooks spoiling the broth?" As most witches are fervent independents, and self-assertively so, each will have a different approach and opinion to such a simple observation. Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of the many esoteric book shops. Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of existing wisdom, at times similar to looking through water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism, however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we stand?

Sample Text:
From "What witches do", Stewart Farrar, 1989, Phoenix Pub., Wash. p.174.
"Appendix 3. Planetary Hours. These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells which have planetary correspondences. Each day has a ruling planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are: Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw); Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday, Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation. Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesday's second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list is as follows:"

Disclaimer: I have it as a strong intention, to point out that this article is not to be taken as a personal attack of the above author or the publisher, or any other connecting party. I have used Stewart Farrar's text only as an example of the commonly published, and accepted, planetary hour concept.

"nial format and who have been or are likely to become touched deeply by war. Realistic acceptance, loving reconciliation, and emotional catharsis are the major themes. Fears, regrets, sympathies, feelings of caring, and grievings are dealt with intensely. Adventure, patriotism, the joy of battle, etc. are ignored. The setting is outdoors in mid-morning light in a clearing among trees. There is a fire in the center of the temple space and an altar at the northernmost point of the circle. MARTIAL HONOR CEREMONY 1. Defining of the Temple Space and Time. All participants form into a circle as a drum beats slowly and steadily (about one beat per second). When the time comes to start, the HPS breaks from the circle and begins to define its outer limits with a sword. After she has just begun, the priest raises an old, rust-marked sword into the air -- this cues the first speakers. Alternating male and female voices call out (one from each quarter as the HPS passes): "TherIn the late nineteen-fifties, two young Californians, later known as Omar Ravenhurst and Malaclypse the Younger, were sipping coffee at an all-night bowling alley, discussing the world's problems. They felt personal confusion and believed that solving the problem of discord would make all other problems vanish. Suddenly, the place became devoid of light, followed by a blinding flash. When vision returned, they saw bowlers frozen in comic positions and a chimpanzee carrying a scroll. The chimpanzee asked them philosophical questions and revealed a diagram before exploding, causing them to lose consciousness.

They awoke to find everything normal and discussed their strange encounter, reconstructing the chimpanzee's diagram. After researching, they discovered the ancient Goddess Eris, known to the Romans as Discordia. They had vivid dreams of a splendid woman who told them they were free and that chaos was a natural force. They concluded that disorder was as significant as order and studied the yin-yang symbol, which they called THE SACRED CHAO. They were appointed Keepers of It and told to spread the message that there are no rules unless invented.

They laughed and declared themselves a society of Discordia. They learned that Eris was mischievous but not malicious and that the Greeks' historical accounts were unreliable. They embraced the principle of disorder and chaos, rejecting societal norms and limitations. They aimed to live authentically and achieve spiritual and personal freedom.In the myth, Void decreed that the nameless brother would reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then with Eris in Being. Eris, filled with sorrow, wept, fearing Aneris would take him back to Non-Being. Void then decreed that the brother would return to Void instead of Non-Being. This symbolizes the cycle of existence and non-existence, emphasizing that everything is true and permissible.

There is serenity in Chaos. Seek the Eye of the Hurricane.

A POEE MYSTEREE RITE - THE SRI SYADASTIAN CHANT

Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted. This one is enhanced by a Leader chanting Sanskrit alone, with participants chanting the English. It helps to be in a quiet frame of mind and sitting still, perhaps in The Buttercup Position. It also helps if one is absolutely zonked out of his gourd.

The Classification of Saints:
1. SAINT SECOND CLASS: Reserved for all human beings deserving of Sainthood. Example: St. Norton the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.
2. LANCE SAINT: Good Saint material and definitely inspiring. Example: St. Yossarian (Catch 22, Heller).
3. LIEUTENANT SAINT: Excellent Goddess-Saturated Saint. Example: St. Quixote (Don Quixote, Cervantes).
4. BRIGADIER SAINT: Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following. Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut).
5. FIVE STAR SAINT: The Five Apostles of Eris.

It is an Old Erisian Tradition to never agree with each other about Saints. Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand Herman Hesse. Only a handful understood Albert Einstein. And nobody understood Emperor Norton.

Slogan of NORTON CABAL - S.F.

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS. When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, they will gain a clearer understanding and more effective magic.

CHAOS IS ENERGY. This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

"Study Demonology with an Enemy This Sunday" sez Thom, Gnos.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM:
1) On your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely midnight, count all visible stars.
2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1, each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number. This contradicts the original assumption.

"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only."

THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM:
To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE:
Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere for their just protection. The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:
Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar:
The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK A GAME by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS:
SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.
PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing... in water or mud or anything you can sink something in.
RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or a hole to drop things in. But rivers, bays, gulfs, I dare say even oceans can be used.
TURNS are taken thusly: whosoever gets the junk up and in the air first.
DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.
UPON SINKING: The sinker shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as thoughtful.
NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus, Ohio!"

A Joint Effort of the Discordian Society POST OFFICE LIBERATION FRONT:
THIS IS A CHAIN LETTER. WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY-FIVE DAYS YOU WILL RECEIVE THIRTY-ELEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF CHAINS! In the meantime - plant your seeds. If a lot of people who receive this letter plant a few seeds and a lot of people receive this letter, then a lot of seeds will get planted. Plant your seeds. In parks. On lots. Public flower beds. In remote places. At City Hall. Wherever. Whenever. Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on it first for that). For casual planting, it's best to soak them in water for a day and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep. Don't worry much about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait for nature. Don't soak them if it's wintertime. Seeds are a very hearty life form and strongly desire to grow and flourish. But some of them need people's help to get started. Plant your seeds. Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to friends of yours. Try to mail to different cities and states, even different countries. If you would rather not, then please pass this copy on to someone and perhaps they would like to. THERE IS NO TRUTH to the legend that if you throw away a chain letter then all sorts of catastrophic, abominable, and outrageous disasters will happen. Except, of course, from your seed's point of view.

Q. "How come a woodpecker doesn't bash its brains out?"
A. Nobody has ever explained that.

Chapter 1, THE EPISTLE TO THE PARANOIDS --Lord Omar:
1. Ye have locked yourselves up in cages of fear--and, behold, do ye now complain that ye lack FREEDOM!
2. Ye have cast out your brothers for devils and now complain ye, lamenting, that ye've been left to fight alone.
3. All Chaos was once your kingdom; verily, held ye dominion over the entire Pentaverse, but today ye was sore afraid in dark corners, nooks, and sinkholes.
4. O how the darknesses do crowd up, one against the other, in ye hearts! What fear ye more than what ye have wroughten?
5. Verily, verily I say unto you, not all the Sinister Ministers of the Bavarian Illuminati, working together in multitudes, could so entwine the land with tribulation as have yer baseless warnings.

PAGAN MANNERS OR Are There Any Dead Animals in The Soup? by Grey Cat, Members Advocate

I can hear the outraged screams already. There are people out there who believe that the very idea of "Pagan Manners" is a conflict in terms; that "manners" are outdated, dishonest and hypocritical. Well, think again. Manners constitute the only successful technique ever discovered by humankind to enable groups and individuals, holding moderately disparate views, customs or beliefs, to get along together. There are things more important than manners; but, without manners, it's unlikely that a discussion will ever go to them. Pagan manners are fairly simple and have nothing to do with which fork you use or how to word an invitation. They have to do with respect for others' feelings and beliefs. They most specifically have to do with recognition of the fact that you should "judge not the path of your brother or sister for their path is sacred." Manners are also the only way of attempting to grant everyone the personal space which each of us needs. There have been a number of attempts to write down a list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots" which will cover Pagan life. Here are several tries made by four different people:

MY OWN OPINIONS
1. Never assume that you are invited to a ritual or a non-public gathering just because your friend is invited. Have your friend call the group doing the event and ASK! (or call yourself).
2. When participating in a ritual led by a group of which you are not a member, ask ahead of time what will be done. Should there be something in the explanation, or in the set-up of the ritual area which bothers you, just quietly don't participate in the ritual.
3. Ask the person(s) officiating at a ritual before you place anything in the ritual area; wear clothing or tools which might be considered unusual; or add private energy workings to the ritual being done.
4. Never just walk out of a cast ritual circle. Ask someone in the group sponsoring the ritual to cut you a door if you really and truly absolutely have to leave.
5. Don't make comments on the ritual, its leaders or the amount or quality of the energy raised during the ritual unless such opinions are asked for by the leaders. Save it for your friends, privately, after the ritual is over.
6. Vegetarians, Vegans, Strict Carnivores, Diabetics, and any others with very strong food preferences: no one minds your asking quietly and politely "Which dishes have meat (sugar, spices, hot pepper, etc.) in them?" When planning a meal for mixed Pagan/Wiccan groups, it is strongly suggested that at least some of the dishes be vegetarian, sugar-free, relatively non-spicy etc. At all times, within and without the ritual context, always provide an alternative to alcoholic beverages.
7. While many people have become far less secretive about their membership in a Pagan group, it is never, EVER, permissible to "blow someone's cover". Do not ever call a friend or acquaintance by their Pagan name or mention their membership in a mundane situation. It is also bad manners - and a symptom of social climbing - to call an individual by his/her mundane name in a Pagan situation. It always reminds me of an extra calling John Wayne "The Duke" at a local bar.
8. Whether you drink, take drugs or indulge in other similar behavior is completely your own business. It is always wrong to urge such behavior on any other individual. The majority of serious Pagan groups absolutely do NOT allow anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol to participate in ritual. Do not be offended if you are turned away for this reason. If you are taking a psycho-active drug for a medical reason it is very wise to check with the ritual leader(s) so they will understand and can advise you if they feel the ritual might be harmful to you.
9. Just because most Pagans/Wiccans are under 40 and in reasonably good physical condition, never assume that everyone is. Rituals and gatherings should be planned so that those with physical problems aren't barred totally from participation. Particularly in ritual, be aware that many more people than you might think are "mobility disabled." Group ritual should take place in an accessible area and some thought should be given to designating a safe place for those not taking part in dancing to stand or sit. Please be alert to anyone to whom help would be welcome. Help them to find a campsite which minimizes walking - to the ritual area, to the privies, to the eating area - whatever. Help them pitch their camp. Don't make them feel unwelcome - most handicapped people have worked extra hard on their magickal skills and may be able to add a great deal to the power in ritual and to the success of the gathering.
10. When at any sort of gathering, please be thoughtful. Particularly please observe true quiet after midnight. No one minds if you and others want to stay up all night talking or whatever. Everyone else minds a great deal if you stay up talking and laughing loudly and/or drumming. Those hosting a gathering should take the responsibility of keeping the noise level very low in at least some of the sleeping areas - and designating it as a quiet area.
11. Do not allow yourself to get the idea that you know the One True, Right and Only Path! Even if you really do have the conviction that what someone else is doing is "wrong", "incorrect", "Left-hand path" or whatever, just don't talk about it. It is perfectly permissible to refrain from participating in the activities of those with whom you cannot feel comfortable. It is not acceptable to express the idea that they "shouldn't" be doing it. This is not to say that if you know of criminal behavior on the part of a so-called Pagan/Wiccan group you should not report it. We must also be responsible for cleaning up our own act. Paganism is glorified by its diversity. Please do not allow yourself to express judgment by categories. Whether or not you like or dislike blacks, Indians, Homosexuals, women, men, or whatever, keep it to yourself! If you really and truly cannot feel comfortable taking part in a ritual which isn't conducted according to the tradition you follow or if you cannot be pleasant in company mixed with groups you disapprove of, please just stay home.

PAGAN/CRAFT ETIQUETTE by Soapbox Sam
Listed below are not hard and fast rules, but some helpful guidelines for those who would function smoothly in a craft/Pagan environment.
1. Should you write to someone for information, always enclose an SASE (Self-addressed, Stamped Envelope). Many of us receive several inquiries a day. Sometimes just answering them, much less having to pay the postage and buy envelopes, is a time-consuming, expensive task!
2. Should your inquiry be about Pagan/Craft folks in your area, tell about yourself, and how you came to have our names and wrote to us - after all the Inquisition is alive and sick here in the heart of the Bible Belt. Do not expect names and addresses unless they are already "public". Most of us, even the "public" Pagan/Craft folks prefer to meet people slowly and carefully over a cup of coffee in a public place, before we start introducing you to our groups and our friends. Why should we risk when you have risked nothing?
3. If you are invited to a gathering or festival, whether by written or oral invitation, before you invite others, get permission. Because of space, or other considerations, the number of people that can be accommodated might be limited, or certain individuals or groups may not be welcome because of personality conflicts and resulting disharmony. Also, if a weekend gathering is scheduled and you can only arrive for the ritual and then must leave, ask if that is OK...sometimes the ritual is the climax of the entire gathering, rather than an event in itself; in that case to show up only for the ritual not having been part of the entire event is to 'take-away' from the meaning of the whole for those who were there!
4. Always inquire what you should bring to any gathering. If you have received an official invitation, you should have been told. But, assume nothing! Ask if you need to bring food, robes, candles, drinks, eating utensils (forks, cups, plates, etc). It is unreasonable and rude to assume that an invitation to a gathering means that people just like yourselves, will expect you to come and eat their food, use their utensils and leave a mess for them to clean up after you have gone. If you cannot take food, then at least offer the gathering's sponsors a cash donation to help defray their cost. If you can't stay to help clean up afterwards, at least be considerate enough to get your own refuse to a garbage container.
5. To be invited to participate in another's ritual is NOT your right, but rather a privilege and an honor. If you are unfamiliar with their tradition, common courtesy demands that you at least inquire about enough information to participate in a positive fashion, and most certainly, make no assumptions about adding anything to the circle or placing your "special' crystals, totems, whatever in the circle or at a specific place within the circle without getting permission. Also, do not remove anything from a circle even should you feel it doesn't belong, without explaining why and getting permission.
6. It should not have to be said, but then neither should any of the above: If these Pagan/Craft rituals have no meaning in your life, and if you have just come for the fellowship, then enjoy the fellowship and please do not attend the ritual. The circle is a significant part of our entire way of life, not a reenactment of some past event just for the sake of the pageantry. When we can, we are pleased to share it with you, and we do so in Love and Light with Peace and Laughter.

IDEAS FROM MERLIN THE ENCHANTER
1. Be Yourself... if you worry about what others think, then you won't think for yourself... and if you don't think for yourself, you may as well be dead!
2. Allow all others to be themselves... just because Joe Blow from Kokomo has blue candles on his altar and you use only white ones, that doesn't mean he is the son of Satan. We must each one be allowed our own Pagan path in freedom, for if we cannot do that, then we have no freedom!
3. Let's stop all the silliness of who is and is not a Witch, and what one must do to be a witch.
4. Don't ask for someone's opinions unless you really want it! More Witch wars are started because someone asked for another's views and didn't like the answer they got!
5. Add a dose of good humor (the worst Witches are the ones that take everything so S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y!)

IDEAS FROM BEKET ASER EDITHSDATTER
It is necessary that we learn to be just plain adult about working together - or even, just existing on the same planet.
1. If you can't tolerate any slightest deviation from your own tradition, do not take part in public or cross-cultural rituals or gatherings.
2. If you have ideas of what should be in the ritual; or what should not - go to the planning meeting and express your opinions.
3. If you delegate a task to someone else - you have made it their job. The only thing you have to say is "Thank you". When and how they do it is their business so long as it is done at the moment it is required.
4. Appoint somebody to keep notes of the planning meetings - as things are said, not afterwards, or, inevitably, there will be disagreements about the ground rules.
5. Gossip: There are a few situations wherein it is legitimate to pass on "gossip". The following suggestions are not all inclusive but may serve to give guidelines for judging:
a. When a major life change definitely is occurring to someone with whom you and the person to whom you pass on the information - frequently work.
b. When you are acting as resource to help someone decrease a situation of disagreement.
c. When you really plan to take positive action to alleviate the situation the gossip refers to.
d. (This situation really does not occur all that often.) When warning someone about an individual whose practices are definitely undesirable for a reason other than that you don't like them.
e. When you have truly accurate information to counteract damaging and inaccurate rumor.
6. When examining a situation to decide whether or not you, yourself, are under psychic attack, be sure to ask yourself if it couldn't be because being under attack makes you feel important.
7. Within the group or group structure, the High Priest and or High Priestess are generally entitled to your respect and a certain amount of deference. If they really, really don't know as much as you do, perhaps it is time that you take a fond and friendly leave of them/him/her and begin a group of your own. Obviously, group or group affairs are appropriate subjects for discussion among all the members, and the HP/S definitely should be willing to listen to reasonable suggestions. However, you joined the group in order to learn from its leaders; a year or two of study probably doesn't qualify you to suddenly object to all their teachings, methods, and beliefs. Above all, it is inappropriate to try to stir up the whole group and "take over" the group. The leaders have put a good deal of time, patience, thought and teaching into building the group and giving it a good name - if you want to be Witch Queen of the Universe, start your own group from scratch and try to become good enough to earn status yourself. The goal is not big groups, it is the best possible groups. For group leaders: They need to be grown-up enough to know that every disagreement isn't necessarily a personal attack. They need to develop leadership skills to avoid confrontation and inflexibility. They need to know how to lead without dominating and they need an intense interest in the health of the group. The HP/S needs to listen to the ideas of the members and to use their ideas whenever possible. They should be able to explain rationally why certain ideas cannot be used.

Study of the Planetary Hours System by Andrew Kettle, 1994

Introduction:
Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so one of the questions that echoes across the valleys of the traditions is; "Are there too many cooks spoiling the broth?" As most witches are fervent independents, and self-assertively so, each will have a different approach and opinion to such a simple observation. Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of the many esoteric book shops. Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of existing wisdom, at times similar to looking through water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism, however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we stand?

Sample Text:
From "What witches do", Stewart Farrar, 1989, Phoenix Pub., Wash. p.174.
"Appendix 3. Planetary Hours. These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells which have planetary correspondences. Each day has a ruling planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are: Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw); Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday, Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation. Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesday's second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list is as follows:"

I have used Stewart Farrar's text only as an example of the commonly published, and accepted, planetary hour concept.

Fears, regrets, sympathies, feelings of caring, and grievings are dealt with intensely. Adventure, patriotism, the joy of battle, etc. are ignored. The setting is outdoors in mid-morning light in a clearing among trees. There is a fire in the center of the temple space and an altar at the northernmost point of the circle. MARTIAL HONOR CEREMONY 1. Defining of the Temple Space and Time. All participants form into a circle as a drum beats slowly and steadily (about one beat per second). When the time comes to start, the HPS breaks from the circle and begins to define its outer limits with a sword. After she has just begun, the priest raises an old, rust-marked sword into the air -- this cues the first speakers. Alternating male and female voices call out (one from each quarter as the HPS passes): "TherIn the myth, Void decreed that the nameless brother would reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then with Eris in Being. Eris, filled with sorrow, wept, fearing Aneris would take him back to Non-Being. Void then decreed that the brother would return to Void instead of Non-Being. This symbolizes the cycle of existence and non-existence, emphasizing that everything is true and permissible.

Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted. This one is enhanced by a Leader chanting Sanskrit alone, with participants chanting the English. It helps to be in a quiet frame of mind and sitting still, perhaps in The Buttercup Position. It also helps if one is absolutely zonked out of his gourd.

3. LIEUTENANT SAINT: Excellent Goddess-Saturated Saint. Example: St. Quixote (Don Quixote, Cervantes).
4. BRIGADIER SAINT: Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following. Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut).
5. FIVE STAR SAINT: The Five Apostles of Eris.

Slogan of NORTON CABAL - S.F.

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS. When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, they will gain a clearer understanding and more effective magic.

CHAOS IS ENERGY. This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

"Study Demonology with an Enemy This Sunday" sez Thom, Gnos.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM:
1) On your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely midnight, count all visible stars.
2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1, each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number. This contradicts the original assumption.

"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only."

THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM:
To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE:
Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere for their just protection. The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:
Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar:
The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK A GAME by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS:
SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.
PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing... in water or mud or anything you can sink something in.
RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or a hole to drop things in. But rivers, bays, gulfs, I dare say even oceans can be used.
TURNS are taken thusly: whosoever gets the junk up and in the air first.
DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.
UPON SINKING: The sinker shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as thoughtful.
NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus, Ohio!"

If a lot of people who receive this letter plant a few seeds and a lot of people receive this letter, then a lot of seeds will get planted. Plant your seeds. In parks. On lots. Public flower beds. In remote places. At City Hall. Wherever. Whenever. Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on it first for that). For casual planting, it's best to soak them in water for a day and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep. Don't worry much about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait for nature. Don't soak them if it's wintertime. Seeds are a very hearty life form and strongly desire to grow and flourish. But some of them need people's help to get started. Plant your seeds. Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to friends of yours. Try to mail to different cities and states, even different countries. If you would rather not, then please pass this copy on to someone and perhaps they would like to. THERE IS NO TRUTH to the legend that if you throw away a chain letter then all sorts of catastrophic, abominable, and outrageous disasters will happen. Except, of course, from your seed's point of view.

Q. "How come a woodpecker doesn't bash its brains out?"
A. Nobody has ever explained that.

Mary Jane says "Plant Your Seeds. Keep Prices Down."

1. Ye have locked yourselves up in cages of fear--and, behold, do ye now complain that ye lack FREEDOM!
2. Ye have cast out your brothers for devils and now complain ye, lamenting, that ye've been left to fight alone.
3. All Chaos was once your kingdom; verily, held ye dominion over the entire Pentaverse, but today ye was sore afraid in dark corners, nooks, and sinkholes.
4. O how the darknesses do crowd up, one against the other, in ye hearts! What fear ye more than what ye have wroughten?
5. Verily, verily I say unto you, not all the Sinister Ministers of the Bavarian Illuminati, working together in multitudes, could so entwine the land with tribulation as have yer baseless warnings.

DESPITE strong evidence to the contrary, persistent rumor has it that it was Mr. Momomoto's brother who swallowed Mr. Momomoto in the summer of '44.

PAGAN MANNERS OR Are There Any Dead Animals in The Soup? by Grey Cat, Members Advocate

I can hear the outraged screams already. There are people out there who believe that the very idea of "Pagan Manners" is a conflict in terms; that "manners" are outdated, dishonest and hypocritical. Well, think again. Manners constitute the only successful technique ever discovered by humankind to enable groups and individuals, holding moderately disparate views, customs or beliefs, to get along together. There are things more important than manners; but, without manners, it's unlikely that a discussion will ever go to them. Pagan manners are fairly simple and have nothing to do with which fork you use or how to word an invitation. They have to do with respect for others' feelings and beliefs. They most specifically have to do with recognition of the fact that you should "judge not the path of your brother or sister for their path is sacred." Manners are also the only way of attempting to grant everyone the personal space which each of us needs. There have been a number of attempts to write down a list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots" which will cover Pagan life. Here are several tries made by four different people:

MY OWN OPINIONS
1. Never assume that you are invited to a ritual or a non-public gathering just because your friend is invited. Have your friend call the group doing the event and ASK! (or call yourself).
2. When participating in a ritual led by a group of which you are not a member, ask ahead of time what will be done. Should there be something in the explanation, or in the set-up of the ritual area which bothers you, just quietly don't participate in the ritual.
3. Ask the person(s) officiating at a ritual before you place anything in the ritual area; wear clothing or tools which might be considered unusual; or add private energy workings to the ritual being done.
4. Never just walk out of a cast ritual circle. Ask someone in the group sponsoring the ritual to cut you a door if you really and truly absolutely have to leave.
5. Don't make comments on the ritual, its leaders or the amount or quality of the energy raised during the ritual unless such opinions are asked for by the leaders. Save it for your friends, privately, after the ritual is over.
6. Vegetarians, Vegans, Strict Carnivores, Diabetics, and any others with very strong food preferences: no one minds your asking quietly and politely "Which dishes have meat (sugar, spices, hot pepper, etc.) in them?" When planning a meal for mixed Pagan/Wiccan groups, it is strongly suggested that at least some of the dishes be vegetarian, sugar-free, relatively non-spicy etc. At all times, within and without the ritual context, always provide an alternative to alcoholic beverages.
7. While many people have become far less secretive about their membership in a Pagan group, it is never, EVER, permissible to "blow someone's cover". Do not ever call a friend or acquaintance by their Pagan name or mention their membership in a mundane situation. It is also bad manners - and a symptom of social climbing - to call an individual by his/her mundane name in a Pagan situation. It always reminds me of an extra calling John Wayne "The Duke" at a local bar.
8. Whether you drink, take drugs or indulge in other similar behavior is completely your own business. It is always wrong to urge such behavior on any other individual. The majority of serious Pagan groups absolutely do NOT allow anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol to participate in ritual. Do not be offended if you are turned away for this reason. If you are taking a psycho-active drug for a medical reason it is very wise to check with the ritual leader(s) so they will understand and can advise you if they feel the ritual might be harmful to you.
9. Just because most Pagans/Wiccans are under 40 and in reasonably good physical condition, never assume that everyone is. Rituals and gatherings should be planned so that those with physical problems aren't barred totally from participation. Particularly in ritual, be aware that many more people than you might think are "mobility disabled." Group ritual should take place in an accessible area and some thought should be given to designating a safe place for those not taking part in dancing to stand or sit. Please be alert to anyone to whom help would be welcome. Help them to find a campsite which minimizes walking - to the ritual area, to the privies, to the eating area - whatever. Help them pitch their camp. Don't make them feel unwelcome - most handicapped people have worked extra hard on their magickal skills and may be able to add a great deal to the power in ritual and to the success of the gathering.
10. When at any sort of gathering, please be thoughtful. Particularly please observe true quiet after midnight. No one minds if you and others want to stay up all night talking or whatever. Everyone else minds a great deal if you stay up talking and laughing loudly and/or drumming. Those hosting a gathering should take the responsibility of keeping the noise level very low in at least some of the sleeping areas - and designating it as a quiet area.
11. Do not allow yourself to get the idea that you know the One True, Right and Only Path! Even if you really do have the conviction that what someone else is doing is "wrong", "incorrect", "Left-hand path" or whatever, just don't talk about it. It is perfectly permissible to refrain from participating in the activities of those with whom you cannot feel comfortable. It is not acceptable to express the idea that they "shouldn't" be doing it. This is not to say that if you know of criminal behavior on the part of a so-called Pagan/Wiccan group you should not report it. We must also be responsible for cleaning up our own act. Paganism is glorified by its diversity. Please do not allow yourself to express judgment by categories. Whether or not you like or dislike blacks, Indians, Homosexuals, women, men, or whatever, keep it to yourself! If you really and truly cannot feel comfortable taking part in a ritual which isn't conducted according to the tradition you follow or if you cannot be pleasant in company mixed with groups you disapprove of, please just stay home.

PAGAN/CRAFT ETIQUETTE by Soapbox Sam
Listed below are not hard and fast rules, but some helpful guidelines for those who would function smoothly in a craft/Pagan environment.
1. Should you write to someone for information, always enclose an SASE (Self-addressed, Stamped Envelope). Many of us receive several inquiries a day. Sometimes just answering them, much less having to pay the postage and buy envelopes, is a time-consuming, expensive task!
2. Should your inquiry be about Pagan/Craft folks in your area, tell about yourself, and how you came to have our names and wrote to us - after all the Inquisition is alive and sick here in the heart of the Bible Belt. Do not expect names and addresses unless they are already "public". Most of us, even the "public" Pagan/Craft folks prefer to meet people slowly and carefully over a cup of coffee in a public place, before we start introducing you to our groups and our friends. Why should we risk when you have risked nothing?
3. If you are invited to a gathering or festival, whether by written or oral invitation, before you invite others, get permission. Because of space, or other considerations, the number of people that can be accommodated might be limited, or certain individuals or groups may not be welcome because of personality conflicts and resulting disharmony. Also, if a weekend gathering is scheduled and you can only arrive for the ritual and then must leave, ask if that is OK...sometimes the ritual is the climax of the entire gathering, rather than an event in itself; in that case to show up only for the ritual not having been part of the entire event is to 'take-away' from the meaning of the whole for those who were there!
4. Always inquire what you should bring to any gathering. If you have received an official invitation, you should have been told. But, assume nothing! Ask if you need to bring food, robes, candles, drinks, eating utensils (forks, cups, plates, etc). It is unreasonable and rude to assume that an invitation to a gathering means that people just like yourselves, will expect you to come and eat their food, use their utensils and leave a mess for them to clean up after you have gone. If you cannot take food, then at least offer the gathering's sponsors a cash donation to help defray their cost. If you can't stay to help clean up afterwards, at least be considerate enough to get your own refuse to a garbage container.
5. To be invited to participate in another's ritual is NOT your right, but rather a privilege and an honor. If you are unfamiliar with their tradition, common courtesy demands that you at least inquire about enough information to participate in a positive fashion, and most certainly, make no assumptions about adding anything to the circle or placing your "special' crystals, totems, whatever in the circle or at a specific place within the circle without getting permission. Also, do not remove anything from a circle even should you feel it doesn't belong, without explaining why and getting permission.
6. It should not have to be said, but then neither should any of the above: If these Pagan/Craft rituals have no meaning in your life, and if you have just come for the fellowship, then enjoy the fellowship and please do not attend the ritual. The circle is a significant part of our entire way of life, not a reenactment of some past event just for the sake of the pageantry. When we can, we are pleased to share it with you, and we do so in Love and Light with Peace and Laughter.

IDEAS FROM MERLIN THE ENCHANTER
1. Be Yourself... if you worry about what others think, then you won't think for yourself... and if you don't think for yourself, you may as well be dead!
2. Allow all others to be themselves... just because Joe Blow from Kokomo has blue candles on his altar and you use only white ones, that doesn't mean he is the son of Satan. We must each one be allowed our own Pagan path in freedom, for if we cannot do that, then we have no freedom!
3. Let's stop all the silliness of who is and is not a Witch, and what one must do to be a witch.
4. Don't ask for someone's opinions unless you really want it! More Witch wars are started because someone asked for another's views and didn't like the answer they got!
5. Add a dose of good humor (the worst Witches are the ones that take everything so S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y!)

IDEAS FROM BEKET ASER EDITHSDATTER
It is necessary that we learn to be just plain adult about working together - or even, just existing on the same planet.
1. If you can't tolerate any slightest deviation from your own tradition, do not take part in public or cross-cultural rituals or gatherings.
2. If you have ideas of what should be in the ritual; or what should not - go to the planning meeting and express your opinions.
3. If you delegate a task to someone else - you have made it their job. The only thing you have to say is "Thank you". When and how they do it is their business so long as it is done at the moment it is required.
4. Appoint somebody to keep notes of the planning meetings - as things are said, not afterwards, or, inevitably, there will be disagreements about the ground rules.
5. Gossip: There are a few situations wherein it is legitimate to pass on "gossip". The following suggestions are not all inclusive but may serve to give guidelines for judging:
a. When a major life change definitely is occurring to someone with whom you and the person to whom you pass on the information - frequently work.
b. When you are acting as resource to help someone decrease a situation of disagreement.
c. When you really plan to take positive action to alleviate the situation the gossip refers to.
d. (This situation really does not occur all that often.) When warning someone about an individual whose practices are definitely undesirable for a reason other than that you don't like them.
e. When you have truly accurate information to counteract damaging and inaccurate rumor.
6. When examining a situation to decide whether or not you, yourself, are under psychic attack, be sure to ask yourself if it couldn't be because being under attack makes you feel important.
7. Within the group or group structure, the High Priest and or High Priestess are generally entitled to your respect and a certain amount of deference. If they really, really don't know as much as you do, perhaps it is time that you take a fond and friendly leave of them/him/her and begin a group of your own. Obviously, group or group affairs are appropriate subjects for discussion among all the members, and the HP/S definitely should be willing to listen to reasonable suggestions. However, you joined the group in order to learn from its leaders; a year or two of study probably doesn't qualify you to suddenly object to all their teachings, methods, and beliefs. Above all, it is inappropriate to try to stir up the whole group and "take over" the group. The leaders have put a good deal of time, patience, thought and teaching into building the group and giving it a good name - if you want to be Witch Queen of the Universe, start your own group from scratch and try to become good enough to earn status yourself. The goal is not big groups, it is the best possible groups. For group leaders: They need to be grown-up enough to know that every disagreement isn't necessarily a personal attack. They need to develop leadership skills to avoid confrontation and inflexibility. They need to know how to lead without dominating and they need an intense interest in the health of the group. The HP/S needs to listen to the ideas of the members and to use their ideas whenever possible. They should be able to explain rationally why certain ideas cannot be used.

Study of the Planetary Hours System by Andrew Kettle, 1994

Introduction:
Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so one of the questions that echoes across the valleys of the traditions is; "Are there too many cooks spoiling the broth?" As most witches are fervent independents, and self-assertively so, each will have a different approach and opinion to such a simple observation. Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of the many esoteric book shops. Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of existing wisdom, at times similar to looking through water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism, however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we stand?

Sample Text:
From "What witches do", Stewart Farrar, 1989, Phoenix Pub., Wash. p.174.
"Appendix 3. Planetary Hours. These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells which have planetary correspondences. Each day has a ruling planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are: Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw); Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday, Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation. Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesday's second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list is as follows:"

I have used Stewart Farrar's text only as an example of the commonly published, and accepted, planetary hour concept.

In the myth, Void decreed that the nameless brother would reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then with Eris in Being. Eris, filled with sorrow, wept, fearing Aneris would take him back to Non-Being. Void then decreed that the brother would return to Void instead of Non-Being. This symbolizes the cycle of existence and non-existence, emphasizing that everything is true and permissible.

Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted. This one is enhanced by a Leader chanting Sanskrit alone, with participants chanting the English.

Slogan of NORTON CABAL - S.F.

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS. When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, they will gain a clearer understanding and more effective magic.

CHAOS IS ENERGY. This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

"Study Demonology with an Enemy This Sunday" sez Thom, Gnos.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM:
1) On your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely midnight, count all visible stars.
2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1, each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number. This contradicts the original assumption.

"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only."

THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM:
To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE:
Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere for their just protection. The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:
Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar:
The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK A GAME by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS:
SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.
PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing... in water or mud or anything you can sink something in.
RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or a hole to drop things in. But rivers, bays, gulfs, I dare say even oceans can be used.
TURNS are taken thusly: whosoever gets the junk up and in the air first.
DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.
UPON SINKING: The sinker shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as thoughtful.
NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus, Ohio!"

THIS IS A CHAIN LETTER. WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY-FIVE DAYS YOU WILL RECEIVE THIRTY-ELEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF CHAINS! In the meantime - plant your seeds. If a lot of people who receive this letter plant a few seeds and a lot of people receive this letter, then a lot of seeds will get planted. Plant your seeds. In parks. On lots. Public flower beds. In remote places. At City Hall. Wherever. Whenever. Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on it first for that). For casual planting, it's best to soak them in water for a day and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep. Don't worry much about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait for nature. Don't soak them if it's wintertime. Seeds are a very hearty life form and strongly desire to grow and flourish. But some of them need people's help to get started. Plant your seeds. Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to friends of yours. Try to mail to different cities and states, even different countries. If you would rather not, then please pass this copy on to someone and perhaps they would like to.

PAGAN MANNERS OR Are There Any Dead Animals in The Soup? by Grey Cat, Members Advocate

I can hear the outraged screams already. There are people out there who believe that the very idea of "Pagan Manners" is a conflict in terms; that "manners" are outdated, dishonest and hypocritical. Well, think again. Manners constitute the only successful technique ever discovered by humankind to enable groups and individuals, holding moderately disparate views, customs or beliefs, to get along together. There are things more important than manners; but, without manners, it's unlikely that a discussion will ever go to them. Pagan manners are fairly simple and have nothing to do with which fork you use or how to word an invitation. They have to do with respect for others' feelings and beliefs. They most specifically have to do with recognition of the fact that you should "judge not the path of your brother or sister for their path is sacred." Manners are also the only way of attempting to grant everyone the personal space which each of us needs. There have been a number of attempts to write down a list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots" which will cover Pagan life. Here are several tries made by four different people:

MY OWN OPINIONS
1. Never assume that you are invited to a ritual or a non-public gathering just because your friend is invited. Have your friend call the group doing the event and ASK! (or call yourself).
2. When participating in a ritual led by a group of which you are not a member, ask ahead of time what will be done. Should there be something in the explanation, or in the set-up of the ritual area which bothers you, just quietly don't participate in the ritual.
3. Ask the person(s) officiating at a ritual before you place anything in the ritual area; wear clothing or tools which might be considered unusual; or add private energy workings to the ritual being done.
4. Never just walk out of a cast ritual circle. Ask someone in the group sponsoring the ritual to cut you a door if you really and truly absolutely have to leave.
5. Don't make comments on the ritual, its leaders or the amount or quality of the energy raised during the ritual unless such opinions are asked for by the leaders. Save it for your friends, privately, after the ritual is over.
6. Vegetarians, Vegans, Strict Carnivores, Diabetics, and any others with very strong food preferences: no one minds your asking quietly and politely "Which dishes have meat (sugar, spices, hot pepper, etc.) in them?" When planning a meal for mixed Pagan/Wiccan groups, it is strongly suggested that at least some of the dishes be vegetarian, sugar-free, relatively non-spicy etc. At all times, within and without the ritual context, always provide an alternative to alcoholic beverages.
7. While many people have become far less secretive about their membership in a Pagan group, it is never, EVER, permissible to "blow someone's cover". Do not ever call a friend or acquaintance by their Pagan name or mention their membership in a mundane situation. It is also bad manners - and a symptom of social climbing - to call an individual by his/her mundane name in a Pagan situation. It always reminds me of an extra calling John Wayne "The Duke" at a local bar.
8. Whether you drink, take drugs or indulge in other similar behavior is completely your own business. It is always wrong to urge such behavior on any other individual. The majority of serious Pagan groups absolutely do NOT allow anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol to participate in ritual. Do not be offended if you are turned away for this reason. If you are taking a psycho-active drug for a medical reason it is very wise to check with the ritual leader(s) so they will understand and can advise you if they feel the ritual might be harmful to you.
9. Just because most Pagans/Wiccans are under 40 and in reasonably good physical condition, never assume that everyone is. Rituals and gatherings should be planned so that those with physical problems aren't barred totally from participation. Particularly in ritual, be aware that many more people than you might think are "mobility disabled." Group ritual should take place in an accessible area and some thought should be given to designating a safe place for those not taking part in dancing to stand or sit. Please be alert to anyone to whom help would be welcome. Help them to find a campsite which minimizes walking - to the ritual area, to the privies, to the eating area - whatever. Help them pitch their camp. Don't make them feel unwelcome - most handicapped people have worked extra hard on their magickal skills and may be able to add a great deal to the power in ritual and to the success of the gathering.
10. When at any sort of gathering, please be thoughtful. Particularly please observe true quiet after midnight. No one minds if you and others want to stay up all night talking or whatever. Everyone else minds a great deal if you stay up talking and laughing loudly and/or drumming. Those hosting a gathering should take the responsibility of keeping the noise level very low in at least some of the sleeping areas - and designating it as a quiet area.
11. Do not allow yourself to get the idea that you know the One True, Right and Only Path! Even if you really do have the conviction that what someone else is doing is "wrong", "incorrect", "Left-hand path" or whatever, just don't talk about it. It is perfectly permissible to refrain from participating in the activities of those with whom you cannot feel comfortable. It is not acceptable to express the idea that they "shouldn't" be doing it. This is not to say that if you know of criminal behavior on the part of a so-called Pagan/Wiccan group you should not report it. We must also be responsible for cleaning up our own act. Paganism is glorified by its diversity. Please do not allow yourself to express judgment by categories. Whether or not you like or dislike blacks, Indians, Homosexuals, women, men, or whatever, keep it to yourself! If you really and truly cannot feel comfortable taking part in a ritual which isn't conducted according to the tradition you follow or if you cannot be pleasant in company mixed with groups you disapprove of, please just stay home.

PAGAN/CRAFT ETIQUETTE by Soapbox Sam
Listed below are not hard and fast rules, but some helpful guidelines for those who would function smoothly in a craft/Pagan environment.
1. Should you write to someone for information, always enclose an SASE (Self-addressed, Stamped Envelope). Many of us receive several inquiries a day. Sometimes just answering them, much less having to pay the postage and buy envelopes, is a time-consuming, expensive task!
2. Should your inquiry be about Pagan/Craft folks in your area, tell about yourself, and how you came to have our names and wrote to us - after all the Inquisition is alive and sick here in the heart of the Bible Belt. Do not expect names and addresses unless they are already "public". Most of us, even the "public" Pagan/Craft folks prefer to meet people slowly and carefully over a cup of coffee in a public place, before we start introducing you to our groups and our friends. Why should we risk when you have risked nothing?
3. If you are invited to a gathering or festival, whether by written or oral invitation, before you invite others, get permission. Because of space, or other considerations, the number of people that can be accommodated might be limited, or certain individuals or groups may not be welcome because of personality conflicts and resulting disharmony. Also, if a weekend gathering is scheduled and you can only arrive for the ritual and then must leave, ask if that is OK...sometimes the ritual is the climax of the entire gathering, rather than an event in itself; in that case to show up only for the ritual not having been part of the entire event is to 'take-away' from the meaning of the whole for those who were there!
4. Always inquire what you should bring to any gathering. If you have received an official invitation, you should have been told. But, assume nothing! Ask if you need to bring food, robes, candles, drinks, eating utensils (forks, cups, plates, etc). It is unreasonable and rude to assume that an invitation to a gathering means that people just like yourselves, will expect you to come and eat their food, use their utensils and leave a mess for them to clean up after you have gone. If you cannot take food, then at least offer the gathering's sponsors a cash donation to help defray their cost. If you can't stay to help clean up afterwards, at least be considerate enough to get your own refuse to a garbage container.
5. To be invited to participate in another's ritual is NOT your right, but rather a privilege and an honor. If you are unfamiliar with their tradition, common courtesy demands that you at least inquire about enough information to participate in a positive fashion, and most certainly, make no assumptions about adding anything to the circle or placing your "special' crystals, totems, whatever in the circle or at a specific place within the circle without getting permission. Also, do not remove anything from a circle even should you feel it doesn't belong, without explaining why and getting permission.
6. It should not have to be said, but then neither should any of the above: If these Pagan/Craft rituals have no meaning in your life, and if you have just come for the fellowship, then enjoy the fellowship and please do not attend the ritual. The circle is a significant part of our entire way of life, not a reenactment of some past event just for the sake of the pageantry. When we can, we are pleased to share it with you, and we do so in Love and Light with Peace and Laughter.

IDEAS FROM MERLIN THE ENCHANTER
1. Be Yourself... if you worry about what others think, then you won't think for yourself... and if you don't think for yourself, you may as well be dead!
2. Allow all others to be themselves... just because Joe Blow from Kokomo has blue candles on his altar and you use only white ones, that doesn't mean he is the son of Satan. We must each one be allowed our own Pagan path in freedom, for if we cannot do that, then we have no freedom!
3. Let's stop all the silliness of who is and is not a Witch, and what one must do to be a witch.
4. Don't ask for someone's opinions unless you really want it! More Witch wars are started because someone asked for another's views and didn't like the answer they got!
5. Add a dose of good humor (the worst Witches are the ones that take everything so S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y!)

IDEAS FROM BEKET ASER EDITHSDATTER
It is necessary that we learn to be just plain adult about working together - or even, just existing on the same planet.
1. If you can't tolerate any slightest deviation from your own tradition, do not take part in public or cross-cultural rituals or gatherings.
2. If you have ideas of what should be in the ritual; or what should not - go to the planning meeting and express your opinions.
3. If you delegate a task to someone else - you have made it their job. The only thing you have to say is "Thank you". When and how they do it is their business so long as it is done at the moment it is required.
4. Appoint somebody to keep notes of the planning meetings - as things are said, not afterwards, or, inevitably, there will be disagreements about the ground rules.
5. Gossip: There are a few situations wherein it is legitimate to pass on "gossip". The following suggestions are not all inclusive but may serve to give guidelines for judging:
a. When a major life change definitely is occurring to someone with whom you and the person to whom you pass on the information - frequently work.
b. When you are acting as resource to help someone decrease a situation of disagreement.
c. When you really plan to take positive action to alleviate the situation the gossip refers to.
d. (This situation really does not occur all that often.) When warning someone about an individual whose practices are definitely undesirable for a reason other than that you don't like them.
e. When you have truly accurate information to counteract damaging and inaccurate rumor.
6. When examining a situation to decide whether or not you, yourself, are under psychic attack, be sure to ask yourself if it couldn't be because being under attack makes you feel important.
7. Within the group or group structure, the High Priest and or High Priestess are generally entitled to your respect and a certain amount of deference. If they really, really don't know as much as you do, perhaps it is time that you take a fond and friendly leave of them/him/her and begin a group of your own. Obviously, group or group affairs are appropriate subjects for discussion among all the members, and the HP/S definitely should be willing to listen to reasonable suggestions. However, you joined the group in order to learn from its leaders; a year or two of study probably doesn't qualify you to suddenly object to all their teachings, methods, and beliefs. Above all, it is inappropriate to try to stir up the whole group and "take over" the group. The leaders have put a good deal of time, patience, thought and teaching into building the group and giving it a good name - if you want to be Witch Queen of the Universe, start your own group from scratch and try to become good enough to earn status yourself. The goal is not big groups, it is the best possible groups. For group leaders: They need to be grown-up enough to know that every disagreement isn't necessarily a personal attack. They need to develop leadership skills to avoid confrontation and inflexibility. They need to know how to lead without dominating and they need an intense interest in the health of the group. The HP/S needs to listen to the ideas of the members and to use their ideas whenever possible. They should be able to explain rationally why certain ideas cannot be used.

Study of the Planetary Hours System by Andrew Kettle, 1994

Introduction:
Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so one of the questions that echoes across the valleys of the traditions is; "Are there too many cooks spoiling the broth?" As most witches are fervent independents, and self-assertively so, each will have a different approach and opinion to such a simple observation. Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of the many esoteric book shops. Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of existing wisdom, at times similar to looking through water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism, however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we stand?

Sample Text:
From "What witches do", Stewart Farrar, 1989, Phoenix Pub., Wash. p.174.
"Appendix 3. Planetary Hours. These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells which have planetary correspondences. Each day has a ruling planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are: Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw); Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday, Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation. Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesday's second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list is as follows:"

In the myth, Void decreed that the nameless brother would reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then with Eris in Being. Eris, filled with sorrow, wept, fearing Aneris would take him back to Non-Being. Void then decreed that the brother would return to Void instead of Non-Being. This symbolizes the cycle of existence and non-existence, emphasizing that everything is true and permissible.

4. BRIGADIER SAINT: Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following. Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut).
5. FIVE STAR SAINT: The Five Apostles of Eris.

Slogan of NORTON CABAL - S.F.

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS. When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, they will gain a clearer understanding and more effective magic.

CHAOS IS ENERGY. This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1, each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number. This contradicts the original assumption.

"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only."

But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE:
Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere for their just protection. The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:
Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar:
The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK A GAME by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS:
SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.
PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing... in water or mud or anything you can sink something in.
RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or a hole to drop things in. But rivers, bays, gulfs, I dare say even oceans can be used.
TURNS are taken thusly: whosoever gets the junk up and in the air first.
DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.
UPON SINKING: The sinker shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as thoughtful.
NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus, Ohio!"

THIS IS A CHAIN LETTER. WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY-FIVE DAYS YOU WILL RECEIVE THIRTY-ELEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF CHAINS! In the meantime - plant your seeds. If a lot of people who receive this letter plant a few seeds and a lot of people receive this letter, then a lot of seeds will get planted. Plant your seeds. In parks. On lots. Public flower beds. In remote places. At City Hall. Wherever. Whenever. Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on it first for that). For casual planting, it's best to soak them in water for a day and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep. Don't worry much about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait for nature. Don't soak them if it's wintertime. Seeds are a very hearty life form and strongly desire to grow and flourish. But some of them need people's help to get started. Plant your seeds. Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to friends of yours. Try to mail to different cities and states, even different countries. If you would rather not, then please pass this copy on to someone and perhaps they would like to.

PAGAN MANNERS OR Are There Any Dead Animals in The Soup? by Grey Cat, Members Advocate

I can hear the outraged screams already. There are people out there who believe that the very idea of "Pagan Manners" is a conflict in terms; that "manners" are outdated, dishonest and hypocritical. Well, think again. Manners constitute the only successful technique ever discovered by humankind to enable groups and individuals, holding moderately disparate views, customs or beliefs, to get along together. There are things more important than manners; but, without manners, it's unlikely that a discussion will ever go to them. Pagan manners are fairly simple and have nothing to do with which fork you use or how to word an invitation. They have to do with respect for others' feelings and beliefs. They most specifically have to do with recognition of the fact that you should "judge not the path of your brother or sister for their path is sacred." Manners are also the only way of attempting to grant everyone the personal space which each of us needs. There have been a number of attempts to write down a list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots" which will cover Pagan life. Here are several tries made by four different people:

MY OWN OPINIONS
1. Never assume that you are invited to a ritual or a non-public gathering just because your friend is invited. Have your friend call the group doing the event and ASK! (or call yourself).
2. When participating in a ritual led by a group of which you are not a member, ask ahead of time what will be done. Should there be something in the explanation, or in the set-up of the ritual area which bothers you, just quietly don't participate in the ritual.
3. Ask the person(s) officiating at a ritual before you place anything in the ritual area; wear clothing or tools which might be considered unusual; or add private energy workings to the ritual being done.
4. Never just walk out of a cast ritual circle. Ask someone in the group sponsoring the ritual to cut you a door if you really and truly absolutely have to leave.
5. Don't make comments on the ritual, its leaders or the amount or quality of the energy raised during the ritual unless such opinions are asked for by the leaders. Save it for your friends, privately, after the ritual is over.
6. Vegetarians, Vegans, Strict Carnivores, Diabetics, and any others with very strong food preferences: no one minds your asking quietly and politely "Which dishes have meat (sugar, spices, hot pepper, etc.) in them?" When planning a meal for mixed Pagan/Wiccan groups, it is strongly suggested that at least some of the dishes be vegetarian, sugar-free, relatively non-spicy etc. At all times, within and without the ritual context, always provide an alternative to alcoholic beverages.
7. While many people have become far less secretive about their membership in a Pagan group, it is never, EVER, permissible to "blow someone's cover". Do not ever call a friend or acquaintance by their Pagan name or mention their membership in a mundane situation. It is also bad manners - and a symptom of social climbing - to call an individual by his/her mundane name in a Pagan situation. It always reminds me of an extra calling John Wayne "The Duke" at a local bar.
8. Whether you drink, take drugs or indulge in other similar behavior is completely your own business. It is always wrong to urge such behavior on any other individual. The majority of serious Pagan groups absolutely do NOT allow anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol to participate in ritual. Do not be offended if you are turned away for this reason. If you are taking a psycho-active drug for a medical reason it is very wise to check with the ritual leader(s) so they will understand and can advise you if they feel the ritual might be harmful to you.
9. Just because most Pagans/Wiccans are under 40 and in reasonably good physical condition, never assume that everyone is. Rituals and gatherings should be planned so that those with physical problems aren't barred totally from participation. Particularly in ritual, be aware that many more people than you might think are "mobility disabled." Group ritual should take place in an accessible area and some thought should be given to designating a safe place for those not taking part in dancing to stand or sit. Please be alert to anyone to whom help would be welcome. Help them to find a campsite which minimizes walking - to the ritual area, to the privies, to the eating area - whatever. Help them pitch their camp. Don't make them feel unwelcome - most handicapped people have worked extra hard on their magickal skills and may be able to add a great deal to the power in ritual and to the success of the gathering.
10. When at any sort of gathering, please be thoughtful. Particularly please observe true quiet after midnight. No one minds if you and others want to stay up all night talking or whatever. Everyone else minds a great deal if you stay up talking and laughing loudly and/or drumming. Those hosting a gathering should take the responsibility of keeping the noise level very low in at least some of the sleeping areas - and designating it as a quiet area.
11. Do not allow yourself to get the idea that you know the One True, Right and Only Path! Even if you really do have the conviction that what someone else is doing is "wrong", "incorrect", "Left-hand path" or whatever, just don't talk about it. It is perfectly permissible to refrain from participating in the activities of those with whom you cannot feel comfortable. It is not acceptable to express the idea that they "shouldn't" be doing it. This is not to say that if you know of criminal behavior on the part of a so-called Pagan/Wiccan group you should not report it. We must also be responsible for cleaning up our own act. Paganism is glorified by its diversity. Please do not allow yourself to express judgment by categories. Whether or not you like or dislike blacks, Indians, Homosexuals, women, men, or whatever, keep it to yourself! If you really and truly cannot feel comfortable taking part in a ritual which isn't conducted according to the tradition you follow or if you cannot be pleasant in company mixed with groups you disapprove of, please just stay home.

PAGAN/CRAFT ETIQUETTE by Soapbox Sam
Listed below are not hard and fast rules, but some helpful guidelines for those who would function smoothly in a craft/Pagan environment.
1. Should you write to someone for information, always enclose an SASE (Self-addressed, Stamped Envelope). Many of us receive several inquiries a day. Sometimes just answering them, much less having to pay the postage and buy envelopes, is a time-consuming, expensive task!
2. Should your inquiry be about Pagan/Craft folks in your area, tell about yourself, and how you came to have our names and wrote to us - after all the Inquisition is alive and sick here in the heart of the Bible Belt. Do not expect names and addresses unless they are already "public". Most of us, even the "public" Pagan/Craft folks prefer to meet people slowly and carefully over a cup of coffee in a public place, before we start introducing you to our groups and our friends. Why should we risk when you have risked nothing?
3. If you are invited to a gathering or festival, whether by written or oral invitation, before you invite others, get permission. Because of space, or other considerations, the number of people that can be accommodated might be limited, or certain individuals or groups may not be welcome because of personality conflicts and resulting disharmony. Also, if a weekend gathering is scheduled and you can only arrive for the ritual and then must leave, ask if that is OK...sometimes the ritual is the climax of the entire gathering, rather than an event in itself; in that case to show up only for the ritual not having been part of the entire event is to 'take-away' from the meaning of the whole for those who were there!
4. Always inquire what you should bring to any gathering. If you have received an official invitation, you should have been told. But, assume nothing! Ask if you need to bring food, robes, candles, drinks, eating utensils (forks, cups, plates, etc). It is unreasonable and rude to assume that an invitation to a gathering means that people just like yourselves, will expect you to come and eat their food, use their utensils and leave a mess for them to clean up after you have gone. If you cannot take food, then at least offer the gathering's sponsors a cash donation to help defray their cost. If you can't stay to help clean up afterwards, at least be considerate enough to get your own refuse to a garbage container.
5. To be invited to participate in another's ritual is NOT your right, but rather a privilege and an honor. If you are unfamiliar with their tradition, common courtesy demands that you at least inquire about enough information to participate in a positive fashion, and most certainly, make no assumptions about adding anything to the circle or placing your "special' crystals, totems, whatever in the circle or at a specific place within the circle without getting permission. Also, do not remove anything from a circle even should you feel it doesn't belong, without explaining why and getting permission.
6. It should not have to be said, but then neither should any of the above: If these Pagan/Craft rituals have no meaning in your life, and if you have just come for the fellowship, then enjoy the fellowship and please do not attend the ritual. The circle is a significant part of our entire way of life, not a reenactment of some past event just for the sake of the pageantry. When we can, we are pleased to share it with you, and we do so in Love and Light with Peace and Laughter.

IDEAS FROM MERLIN THE ENCHANTER
1. Be Yourself... if you worry about what others think, then you won't think for yourself... and if you don't think for yourself, you may as well be dead!
2. Allow all others to be themselves... just because Joe Blow from Kokomo has blue candles on his altar and you use only white ones, that doesn't mean he is the son of Satan. We must each one be allowed our own Pagan path in freedom, for if we cannot do that, then we have no freedom!
3. Let's stop all the silliness of who is and is not a Witch, and what one must do to be a witch.
4. Don't ask for someone's opinions unless you really want it! More Witch wars are started because someone asked for another's views and didn't like the answer they got!
5. Add a dose of good humor (the worst Witches are the ones that take everything so S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y!)

IDEAS FROM BEKET ASER EDITHSDATTER
It is necessary that we learn to be just plain adult about working together - or even, just existing on the same planet.
1. If you can't tolerate any slightest deviation from your own tradition, do not take part in public or cross-cultural rituals or gatherings.
2. If you have ideas of what should be in the ritual; or what should not - go to the planning meeting and express your opinions.
3. If you delegate a task to someone else - you have made it their job. The only thing you have to say is "Thank you". When and how they do it is their business so long as it is done at the moment it is required.
4. Appoint somebody to keep notes of the planning meetings - as things are said, not afterwards, or, inevitably, there will be disagreements about the ground rules.
5. Gossip: There are a few situations wherein it is legitimate to pass on "gossip". The following suggestions are not all inclusive but may serve to give guidelines for judging:
a. When a major life change definitely is occurring to someone with whom you and the person to whom you pass on the information - frequently work.
b. When you are acting as resource to help someone decrease a situation of disagreement.
c. When you really plan to take positive action to alleviate the situation the gossip refers to.
d. (This situation really does not occur all that often.) When warning someone about an individual whose practices are definitely undesirable for a reason other than that you don't like them.
e. When you have truly accurate information to counteract damaging and inaccurate rumor.
6. When examining a situation to decide whether or not you, yourself, are under psychic attack, be sure to ask yourself if it couldn't be because being under attack makes you feel important.
7. Within the group or group structure, the High Priest and or High Priestess are generally entitled to your respect and a certain amount of deference. If they really, really don't know as much as you do, perhaps it is time that you take a fond and friendly leave of them/him/her and begin a group of your own. Obviously, group or group affairs are appropriate subjects for discussion among all the members, and the HP/S definitely should be willing to listen to reasonable suggestions. However, you joined the group in order to learn from its leaders; a year or two of study probably doesn't qualify you to suddenly object to all their teachings, methods, and beliefs. Above all, it is inappropriate to try to stir up the whole group and "take over" the group. The leaders have put a good deal of time, patience, thought and teaching into building the group and giving it a good name - if you want to be Witch Queen of the Universe, start your own group from scratch and try to become good enough to earn status yourself. The goal is not big groups, it is the best possible groups. For group leaders: They need to be grown-up enough to know that every disagreement isn't necessarily a personal attack. They need to develop leadership skills to avoid confrontation and inflexibility. They need to know how to lead without dominating and they need an intense interest in the health of the group. The HP/S needs to listen to the ideas of the members and to use their ideas whenever possible. They should be able to explain rationally why certain ideas cannot be used.

Study of the Planetary Hours System by Andrew Kettle, 1994

Introduction:
Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so one of the questions that echoes across the valleys of the traditions is; "Are there too many cooks spoiling the broth?" As most witches are fervent independents, and self-assertively so, each will have a different approach and opinion to such a simple observation. Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of the many esoteric book shops. Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of existing wisdom, at times similar to looking through water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism, however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we stand?

Sample Text:
From "What witches do", Stewart Farrar, 1989, Phoenix Pub., Wash. p.174.
"Appendix 3. Planetary Hours. These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells which have planetary correspondences. Each day has a ruling planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are: Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw); Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday, Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation. Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesday's second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list is as follows:"

In the myth, Void decreed that the nameless brother would reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then with Eris in Being. Eris, filled with sorrow, wept, fearing Aneris would take him back to Non-Being. Void then decreed that the brother would return to Void instead of Non-Being. This symbolizes the cycle of existence and non-existence, emphasizing that everything is true and permissible.

Slogan of NORTON CABAL - S.F.

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS. When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, they will gain a clearer understanding and more effective magic.

CHAOS IS ENERGY. This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

"Study Demonology with an Enemy This Sunday" sez Thom, Gnos.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM:
1) On your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely midnight, count all visible stars.
2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1, each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number. This contradicts the original assumption.

"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only."

THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM:
To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE:
Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere for their just protection. The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:
Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar:
The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK A GAME by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS:
SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.
PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing... in water or mud or anything you can sink something in.
RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or a hole to drop things in. But rivers, bays, gulfs, I dare say even oceans can be used.
TURNS are taken thusly: whosoever gets the junk up and in the air first.
DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.
UPON SINKING: The sinker shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as thoughtful.
NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus, Ohio!"

Dear Brother Mal-2,

In response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted in the new edition of PRINCIPIA, hope the following will be of use. And please stop bothering us with your incessant letters!

Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been fully established in Atlantis, circa 18,000 B.C., under Kull, the galley slave who ascended to the Throne of Valusia. Revived by Pelias of Koth, circa 10,000 B.CIn the myth, Void decreed that the nameless brother would reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then with Eris in Being. Eris, filled with sorrow, wept, fearing Aneris would take him back to Non-Being. Void then decreed that the brother would return to Void instead of Non-Being. This symbolizes the cycle of existence and non-existence, emphasizing that everything is true and permissible.

There is serenity in Chaos. Seek the Eye of the Hurricane.

A POEE MYSTEREE RITE - THE SRI SYADASTIAN CHANT
Written by Mal-2

Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted. This one is enhanced by a Leader chanting Sanskrit alone, with participants chanting the English. It helps to be in a quiet frame of mind and sitting still, perhaps in The Buttercup Position. It also helps if one is absolutely zonked out of his gourd.

RUB-A-DUB-DUB
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Hung Mung.
SYA-DASTI
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Mo-jo.
SYA-DAVAK-TAVYA
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Zara-thud.
SYA-DASTI SYA-NASTI
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Elder Mal.
SYA-DASTI KAVAK-TAV-YASKA
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Gu-lik.
SYA-DASTI, SYA-NASTI, SYA-DAVAK-TAV-YASKA
O! Hail Eris. All Hail Discordia.
RUB-A-DUB-DUB

It is then repeated indefinitely, or for the first two thousand miles, whichever comes first.

The Classification of Saints:
1. SAINT SECOND CLASS: Reserved for all human beings deserving of Sainthood. Example: St. Norton the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.
2. LANCE SAINT: Good Saint material and definitely inspiring. Example: St. Yossarian (Catch 22, Heller).
3. LIEUTENANT SAINT: Excellent Goddess-Saturated Saint. Example: St. Quixote (Don Quixote, Cervantes).
4. BRIGADIER SAINT: Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following. Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut).
5. FIVE STAR SAINT: The Five Apostles of Eris.

It is an Old Erisian Tradition to never agree with each other about Saints. Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand Herman Hesse. Only a handful understood Albert Einstein. And nobody understood Emperor Norton.

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites.

Slogan of NORTON CABAL - S.F.

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS. When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, they will gain a clearer understanding and more effective magic.

CHAOS IS ENERGY. This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

"Study Demonology with an Enemy This Sunday" sez Thom, Gnos.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM:
1) On your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely midnight, count all visible stars.
2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1, each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number. This contradicts the original assumption.

"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only."

THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM:
To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE:
Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere for their just protection. The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:
Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar:
The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip.

RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or a hole to drop things in. But rivers, bays, gulfs, I dare say even oceans can be used.

DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.
UPON SINKING: The sinker shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as thoughtful.
NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus, Ohio!"

Dear Brother Mal-2,

In response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted in the new edition of PRINCIPIA, hope the following will be of use. And please stop bothering us with your incessant letters!

Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been fully established in Atlantis, circa 18,000 B.C., under Kull, the galley slave who ascended to the Throne of Valusia. Revived by Pelias of Koth, circa 10,

Pronunciation:
"TUG-im KIR-oo gu GAAR-du gu AN-aal FINN!
TUG-im KIR-oo gu DOO-li gu AN-um!

The Words of Power:
After the Guardians have been called, the Words of Power are spoken, and the Rite or Sign of Three Rays is performed for each of the Quarters.

"IAO":
This is the name of the God/dess of All and is intoned three times while making the appropriate hand gestures:
"EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO."
"EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO."
"EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO."

Threshold Experiences:
If a portal to another plane or place is to be opened, then the following Charm of Making is to be said three times (this Charm uses the Power of Sea and Stone):
"A ELFNTODD DWYR SINDDYN DUW
CERRIG YR FFERLLURUG NWYN;
OS SYRIAETH ECH SAFFAER TU
FEWR ECHLYN MOR, NECROMBOR LLUN."

Dragon's Breath:
If something is to be caused to happen or prevented, then the following Charm of Making is intoned three times (this charm invokes the Powers of Fire and Air):
"ANAIL NATHROCK
UTHVASS BETHUDD
DOCHIEL DIENVE."

At this point, the Power has been raised. The Will of the Draoi should be directed and stated forcefully in the direction of greatest Power using the sign for that Quarter. Once the work is completed, the God/desses and Guardians should be thanked, and the Power Earthed by lowering both hands to the ground while kneeling. The Circle is opened in the reverse of its creation, and the bounty of the Land and Tuatha should be enjoined and enjoyed by all.

This is the end of the prepared presentation on the Charm of "Making." This and "Pathworking" are the two most powerful abilities of a Druid.

Celtic Workshop #14 - "The Wheel of Elements or Seasons":
Forum member Freepowder noted similarities between the Plains Indian Medicine Wheels and Fionn's Wheel from Celtic sources. His analysis and presentation on these topics led into a discussion of other cross-cultural similarities. I added some info from a study of the indigenous peoples of the world as well as Celtic topics. Tonight, our man of many names, Freepowder, O'Ba'n, John White, Sir Freep, etc., will give us his thoughts on the wheel and the directions as compared between the Plains Indians and the Celts. It looks to be good! I may have a few comments of my own. I also have some info on these directions compiled by a noted anthropologist, Angeles Arriens, for the indigenous peoples of the world. I hope we can discuss the use and meanings of directions to all of us in our magical work.

The Wheel of Elements or Seasons:
The world over, aboriginal religions have used the circle as a symbol of the world, the cosmos, and the spirit. Tonight, I will attempt to draw some parallels between the Celtic version, Fionn's wheel or window, and the Plains Indian version, the Medicine wheel. Both of these wheels are pictured as a circle bisected by two lines, one vertical and one horizontal. In Plains Indian (PI from here on), the circle represents the cycles of the earth, of learning, and of life. The lines represent the 'roads' one must travel to achieve enlightenment. The points at which the lines intersect the circle signify the four directions: east to the right, south at the bottom, west to the left, and north at the top. There are qualities and totems (animal spirit guides) assigned to each direction. The totems and qualities vary somewhat, tribe to tribe, and the following is an attempt to combine several, mostly Lakota (Sioux) and Tsisistis (Cheyenne).

East: red, illumination, child, the sun, spring, the source of life, eagle, hawk, and birds generally.
South: yellow, innocence, youth, daylight, summer, fullness of life, snake, lizard, mouse, horse, elk.
West: black or blue, introspection, maturity, sunset, autumn, waning of life, thunder beings, bear, buffalo.
North: white, wisdom, old age, night, winter, death, wolf, raven, buffalo.

The PI speak of the guardians of the quarters as 'Grandfathers' or 'Grandmothers.' Animals in mundane life are referred to as 'Little Brother or Sister.' At the center of the wheel is, in Lakota, 'Wakan Tanka,' the Great Mystery. The source of all life, of all that is. Although Wakan Tanka is referred to as Grandfather, it has no sex, no body; it is at once the creator and all of creation. Also at the center is White Buffalo woman (or Sweet Medicine to the Cheyenne), the personification of the earth, and the female aspect of Wakan Tanka.

The cycle of life as illustrated by the Medicine Wheel starts at the east. The PI believe that as an infant, a person knows all things, thus the connection with enlightenment. As you grow into youth, these things are forgotten so you may learn and grow, symbolized by the south and innocence. When you are mature, you move to the west and introspection. Here you take your vision quest. As you approach old age, you achieve wisdom in the north and, if you survive, you return to the enlightenment of the east.

On to the Celts!
The Celts use either a four-spoked wheel, identical to the medicine wheel in appearance, or enhance the image with 'cross quarters,' making an eight-spoked wheel. One difference in the Celtic version of the Wheel is probably due to the variation in weather patterns between the British Isles and the Great Plains. The British Isles are around 1000 miles north of the Plains, causing several things to happen. The sun, even at midsummer, will rise far further to the north in Britain. Britain's proximity to the trade winds causes the prevailing winds to come from different directions. Therefore, the Celts start their journey of life in the north. The qualities of the quarters are remarkably similar if somewhat skewed as to direction. (Note: the animals assigned to quarters and cross-quarters are approximate, and individual impressions as to what animal goes where are most important IMHO)

They are:
North: black, winter, wisdom, clarity, death, earth, animals, minerals, fallowness, darkness, winter solstice, salmon, wolf, the Morrigan.
East: red, spring, inspiration, life, birth, renewal, air, birds, smell, dryness, germination, spring equinox, otter, crow.
South: white, summer, spirit, humanity, change, power, fire, sun, light, vegetables, summer solstice, bear, hawk.
West: grey, autumn, creativity, ripeness, fertility, compassion, love, emotions, hearing, water, moon, twilight, fish, autumn equinox, stag, hound.

The cross-quarters mark the seasonal festivals, have associated animals, and are used to represent the ages of mankind:
Imbolc: 31 Jan, child, eagle.
Beltaine: 30 Apr, youth, sow.
Lughnasadh: 31 Jul, adult, horse.
Samhain: 31 Oct, elder, heron.

The Celts assign Gods and Goddesses to the quarters as well. The following courtesy of O'Dubh, and subject to interpretation. God/esses are directional as follows:
North: Master Morfessa of Falias, The Morrighan, Goibhniu, The Dagdha, Epona, Eriu, Macha (The Land, the Lia Fal, Magick, Sovereignty).
East: Master Uscias of Findias, Danu, Anu, Lir, Lugh, Bridget, Scathach, Ogma, Nuada (The Invincible Sword, Wisdom, Strength, the Winds).
South: Master Esras from Gorias, The Dagdha, Lugh, Bridget, Danu (The Flaming Spear, Action, Fire, the Sun or Shining One).
West: Master Semias from Murias, Manannan mac Lir, The Dagdha, The Cailleach, Cerridwen, Danu, Dianecht, Arianrhod (Rebirth, the Undry, the Sacred Cauldron, the Sea, Water).

Many of these God/desses are assigned to more than one direction because they have more than one aspect (The Dagdha, Danu, Bridget, Lugh, the Morrighan). The best way to associate them with a particular direction is to base their direction upon their role in your Working or upon their use of the magickal tool involved.

The Celts have this multi-faceted diversity in the nature and directions of their God/desses due to their travels across Europe and their incorporation of the local Deities into the Deities of their respective clans. When they finally stopped their travels, these Deities were then more fixed in their associated directions and attributes. As modern-day Celts, we have the use of all of these Archetypes to aid our worship and to enrich our Magicks!

The Cherokee say that all ancient cultures descend through the Pleiades and that the Druids and the Cherokee have origins in Atlantis. The Cherokee calendar, as are most medicine wheels, is based on the Mayan system of time. The Dogon of W. Africa say the same, which is very similar to the Celtic. Most ancient cultures say they got the wheel from the stars. Also, some of the first sailors to come in contact with North American Indians were Welsh, and they could converse with some of the tribes! It seemed the Indians were speaking Welsh!

The Cherokee also claim twelve tribes came out of Atlantis when it was destroyed and populated the areas of the earth, bringing this ancient wisdom to other cultures. Like the 12 tribes of Israel, there are 12 clans in the Cherokee matrilineage. There was contact between the Nordic Vikings and the Indians after contact with the Celts too.

As to the NA Indians speaking Welsh, I attended a Celtic League symposium a year or two back, and this was one of the talks. I'll have to go back and review my notes, but as I recall, this is heavily debated. The accounts go back to a Welsh prince who supposedly sailed to America. Whether or not this is true is highly uncertain.

The Welsh Prince was Madoc, and I believe he was supposed to have sailed in the 11th century. There were records of his sailing away, but nothing on where he ended up. He most certainly never returned to Wales. One possible explanation for the 'Welsh' Indians is the occurrence of grey eyes in some of the southern tribes, notably the Choctaw and Cherokee. There are some similarities in the languages, but it is possible that this is due to some wandering Celt heading east from the Orient.

There are many other similarities, notably the common belief among both sets of peoples, the Cherokees and the Celts, that springs were doorways to the Underworlds and possessed their own spirits. There are other similarities. The Irish have legends about the first settlers coming from the west after a flood. This was later Christianized to be the daughter of Noah, Ceasir, but it was first thought to be Atlantis. Also, some of the alignments of the stone circles are on the Pleiades. In fact, the two major hubs of the Celtic year are connected to when the Pleiades first ascend into the constellation of Taurus. That is when Bealtaine and Samhain actually occur.

As to use in your magickal workings, given the eclectic nature of most American Mages, the introduction of the Plains Indian version of the attributes of the quarters is allowable. Perhaps even justified given our geographical location. I personally use the Indian colors and animals in conjunction with the Celtic God/esses. As they used to say in the Toyota commercials, 'It just feels right.'

I have another set of values for directions. Then a brief discussion of future topics. I know everyone is suffering from too much Holiday!

Here's my blurb on directions:
The "Four Fold Way" by Angeles Arrien, a survey of sacred directions and paths of the indigenous peoples of the world, gives the following characteristics to the directions:
North: The Way of the Warrior, Direction of Power, Element is Air, winged creatures, Standing Meditations, Right Actions, Dancing, instrument is the rattle, and season is the Winter.
East: The Way of the Visionary, Direction of Vision, Element is Fire, desert and no-legged creatures, Walking meditations, Truth-telling, Singing, instrument is the bell, and season is Summer.
South: The Way of the Healer, Direction of Love, Element of Earth, All four-legged creatures, Meditating while laying down, Right Speech is the way of living, Paying attention, Storytelling, instrument is the drum, and the season is Spring.
West: The Way of the Teacher, Direction of Wisdom, Element of Water, All Water creatures, Sitting meditations, Right Timing in life's actions, Being Open-minded to outcomes, Silence is the best wisdom, instruments are sticks and bones, and season is Autumn.

"People that eat blowfish are stupid. People that do not eat blowfish are also stupid." --Japanese proverb

With the advent of the New Age, many people are airing great new ways to change your life for the better. These ideas are based on the premise that we have total control of our lives on some level. All we need do is reach that level with our desires. This is, of course, the big challenge. You can read millions of words on that subject. Why is there so much information? Because achieving this kind of control is a very individual thing. There are so many different ways that each person could write his own book. To succeed, each must find his own path. The reason there are instructions at all, though, is because each can find guidance in the successes of others. Magick is one of these many guides.

This file is relatively short because it concentrates less on the myriad details of magick and more on how to find your own path. The task is never as easy as it sounds, but it is not complex, either. With straightforward exercises (good, honest work on your Self), you will achieve whatever you desire. We all have this power. The way we use it is not by gaining a new ability, but by getting out of the way of the ability we already have. This book outlines the basic blocks and the kinds of things to do about them. But, as with any advice, it is up to you to honestly assess your own situation and discover what works best for you. Remember, achieving your personal Power is everyone's path in life. You will succeed, it is only a question of when. This book is designed to bring that success more quickly and, overall, more easily.

Many people these days still appeal to the "booga-booga" aspect of magick: "We will grant you incredible powers to use on whomever you please if you send us money." As we enter into the New Age of understanding, people are learning that occult powers are actually a natural part of everyone's life. It is our goal to help this process along. We hope to teach newcomers what magick is about. This book is written not only to inform but also to circumvent the psychological barriers set up by living in a mechanistic society. The mechanistic paradigm (the idea that each person and object is totally separate from the rest of the universe except through physical interaction) precludes magick (non-physically affecting one's environment). The magickal paradigm states that your beliefs create your reality. This choice is like contemplating eating blowfish-- when you analyze it, you can conclude that adopting either paradigm is stupid. Since you can't please everyone else, pick the one that you like best. If (and only if) the magickal paradigm appeals to you, then choose it. Then the trick is to get out of the mind-set that says that magick is impossible. We hope that you will try some exercises to prove to yourself that magick works. Once you have done so, then you are on the way to achieving anything you desire.

POWER:
Power can be a very misleading term. The way most people mean it is in the sense of "power-over." People recognize power as the ability to get others to do what you want, especially when these others have different ideas. This is not Power (with a capital 'P') at all. When you rely on someone else to do something for you, you give your Power to him. This is very different from doing something *with* someone, then both parties gain. But, to believe that you must force or trick another is to say that you need this person to do something that you cannot. You may steal their power (lower case) but you give away your Power.

Power is, among other things, the innate ability to bring whatever you truly desire into your life. When you "make" others manifest them for you, you create blocks in your own mind. These blocks say "I cannot do this myself," which obstructs your Power. This is "giving away your Power."

When you "take your Power," you accept responsibility for your life. This is not guilt or martyrdom, it is honestly assessing your life and recognizing your successes and failures. Give yourself credit for even the smallest success and recognize that you can overcome every obstacle. Then you allow your Power to express itself. What you need comes to you; projects work for you.

We often think of many obstacles as insurmountable. For instance, many believe the lottery to be their only desperate hope of escaping poverty. Such people give away their Power. And why shouldn't they? Everything they've experienced tells them this. Our whole society is rooted in the mechanistic paradigm (all causes and effects have a physical link), which precludes a belief in Power. How is one to know that this concept works? How can this be real when it is so different from what we are used to?

Our society has a concept of "Reality" as an objective existence of which we are all a part. When two people have different ideas of the nature of some detail, then at least one is Wrong. We all have a fear of being Wrong. When we are Wrong we miss out on things and people don't like us as much. Therefore we desperately strive to be Right. It turns out that Right is whatever those around you happen to feel that it should be. It's as if they all took a vote when you were out of the room. But "Right" changes all the time: from preservatives are harmless, to preservatives cause cancer; from Stalin is a great leader, to Stalin was a monster; from Ptolemy explains the forces of theDocument Name: memories/_theBookOfShadows.txt

Often hear, you must love yourself first. This isn't a problem, for you already love yourself-- that is the main reason you are alive. The problem is when you block that love. Eliminating these blocks is the Soul's goal. But don't despair, you needn't actually remove them to draw love to you. Just beginning the work can attract that special someone who will help. Affirmations: I am a perfect manifestation of love and I draw love to me. I now allow love to come into my life. I feel and express perfect love and draw other loving people into my life. Visualizations: Picture yourself as a magnet, feeling and drawing love. Imagine yourself bathed in green or pink or orange light, depending on your goals. Pink is for filial love (agape) and for that of a lover. Orange is for the sexual aspect (spleen chakrum). Green is for both (heart chakrum). But the distinctions are somewhat blurred, for love is a combination of all of these. Other: Friday is the day of Venus and the waxing to full Moon is a time of increase, so these are good times for ritual. The ubiquitous heart symbol can be useful.

Prosperity: Money is not all there is to prosperity. What do you want the money for? What kind of life do you want to live? What do you want to have? Keep these goals in mind. You may get them instead of the money. As you work through your blocks to prosperity, you will probably find that one of the biggest is guilt. Our society functions under the assumption that a person can only gain at the expense of others. Don't try to get money by taking it from others through force or fraud, magickally or otherwise. That is giving your Power away. In the magickal paradigm, you create. When you understand this, there is no greed because you can have whatever you desire and without taking from others. It is not money that is a root of evil, but the love of money. It doesn't matter how much you get, but how you get it. When you do a prosperity spell, it should be a joyful expression of the infinite supply available to you. If you are begging or hoping to be rescued, you have more background work to do. Another aspect to remember is that money, like all other kinds of energy, flows. In order to get it, you have to spend it. There must be an outflux for there to be an influx. This is not an excuse to be irresponsible! It is easy for the flow to be too much in either direction (especially out!). Don't be miserly or wasteful, remember the flow. Use each bill you pay to remind you that you've drawn the money to pay it and that more money will come to take its place. Affirmations: I allow prosperity to manifest itself in my life in great abundance. I draw from the infinite source all the money I need and more. In my life, I now express the infinite supply of wealth around me. Visualizations: Imagine yourself bathed in green light (heart chakrum). This is a situation where visualization works particularly well, because it's a tangible object. You can even use a picture or model of the new home or car you want. Other: Good times for a prosperity ritual are Thursday, the day for increase, and during the waxing Moon. The $ (or appropriate regional symbol) has a great deal of power-- consider using it.

Health & Self Improvement: Your body is the most direct expression of your Little Self. It is one of the most accessible, yet challenging things to change. If you can find and address the root causes of health problems, like heart disease, it is often relatively easy to do something about them. But self-image problems can be very difficult because of the way our society approaches the subject. Overweight is a good example of a self-image problem. Madison Avenue bombards us with an ideal of beauty. It is almost impossible to escape. If you are overweight and unhappy about it for other than health reasons, you are probably a victim of this. It is dangerously easy to make self-love or approval contingent upon losing weight. Until you've lost it, you may feel undeserving and thus fail. You may succeed, only to have old habits or new crises throw you back into old eating habits. You have made no fundamental change, so the cycle reinforces itself. So many different problems manifest this way. You will certainly want to deal with eating habits and exercise, but this is often insufficient. People have different metabolic rates and different body types. Do not make liking yourself contingent upon your having a different body type! If you dislike your body, you dislike your Little Self. You must love yourself unconditionally. This is the same transcendent spirit expressed in wedding vows: for better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health. Love yourself not regardless of how you look, but because of how you look. Wanting to improve doesn't mean that you must dislike yourself as you are. If you were given $900, you wouldn't despise it because it wasn't $1000. Rejoice in your Little Self's expression of being alive. Until you do, this lesson will hang over your head. Ironically, you are most able to change your looks when it matters to you least. Remember to be responsible. Always get good health care. When trying to lose weight, follow a sane plan under a doctor's care. But in addition, work to love yourself unconditionally. Strive constantly to fight the messages from the media and those around you. You are a loving, lovable person and your looks reflect this. Make yourself aware of that. When you succeed, you may eventually look like your ideal, but even if you don't, you will see the beauty in yourself. You will be more able to defend yourself from those small minds unhappy enough to attack you for not conforming to their ideal. You will also draw those who can see your beauty. As an extreme example, anorexics always feel that they are too fat. They cannot lose more weight, for that would kill them. The answer lies with truly seeing themselves. Any time your goal is self-improvement, the principle is the same. In order to better yourself, you must first realize that you are lovable, now and always. Never try to better yourself to become lovable-- it doesn't work. The goal of magick is to heal those things you do not like in yourself, not destroy them. You better yourself by first bettering your self-image. You change your behavior by healing the hurts that cause you to do harmful things. Recognize that all unhappy things are in response to pain. Your Little Self can hurt you, much as a favorite pet may bite you because it is in pain. Do not feel anger or misery but love and healing. Affirmations: I love myself completely as I am now. I surrender to love. I know that I am a loving and lovable person. I heal all hurts. I now express perfect health in my life. I bring complete health into my life. My body is now a beautiful, healthy expression of my Self. Visualizations: Imagine yourself so close to the sun that you can see nothing else. Visualize the area you want to heal bathed in blue-green light. Listen to or imagine the note F#. Concentrate on the heart and throat chakra (green and blue, respectively). The root chakrum (red) is another good focus for physical well-being. When healing someone not present, put a photo next to a candle. Put the name of the subject on the candle and use this to focus your concentration. Other: Rituals to increase energy and health are most effective during the waxing moon and at high noon. Rituals for eliminating disease or losing weight are best done during the waning moon. The five-pointed star (symbol of Man) might be a good symbol (if you do not have any negative associations with it).

Good Luck! At this point you are on your own. It takes forty days to make or break a habit, so you should concentrate on daily exercise for at least this long. Magick is not a quick, easy way of getting what you want. It is a long, hard road. Though it's quite possible to have instant success, visible results can take months. Real rewards can take years. But we all must travel this road some time. Be cautious of those promising an easier path. Though it may appear slow, magick is one of the fastest ways of taking your Power. The difficulty lies not in feats of physical or mental prowess, but in steady diligence. Do not try too hard, or you will not last long. If you are not happy with the way your life is going now and you desire to take your power, then commit to the life changes which magick demands. If your commitment is genuine, then everything will fall into place over time. Above all, be patient. Best of luck and stay on the path.
