Total Verses: 286
Revealed At: Medina

1. In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
2. Alif. Lam. Mim.
3. This is the Book; there is no doubt in it, a guide for those who are mindful of God;
4. Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;
5. And who believe in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, and have certainty in the Hereafter.
6. They are on true guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.
7. As for those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.
8. God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; they will have a great punishment.
9. Among people, there are some who say, "We believe in God and the Last Day," but they do not really believe.
10. They try to deceive God and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves without realizing it.
11. In their hearts is a disease, and God has increased their disease; they will have a painful punishment because they lie.
12. When it is said to them, "Do not make mischief on the earth," they say, "We are only peacemakers."
13. Indeed, they are the ones who make mischief, but they do not realize it.
14. When it is said to them, "Believe as the others believe," they say, "Shall we believe as the fools believe?" Indeed, they are the fools, but they do not know.
15. When they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe," but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "We are really with you; we were only mocking."
16. God will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones.
17. These are the ones who have bartered guidance for error; their trade is profitless, and they have lost true direction.
18. Their example is like that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, God took away their light and left them in utter darkness, so they could not see.
19. Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return to the path.
20. Or like a rain-laden cloud from the sky: in it are zones of darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap, while they are in terror of death. But God is ever around the rejecters of faith.
21. The lightning almost snatches away their sight; every time the light helps them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand still. If God willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for God has power over all things.
22. O people! Worship your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who came before you, so that you may learn righteousness;
23. Who has made the earth your resting place, and the sky your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth fruits for your sustenance; then do not set up rivals to God when you know the truth.
24. If you doubt what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it and call your witnesses besides God if you are truthful.
25. But if you cannot—and you will never be able to—then fear the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for those who reject faith.
26. Give good news to those who believe and do good deeds: they will have gardens with rivers flowing beneath them. Whenever they are given fruits from these gardens, they will say, "This is what we were given before," because they will be given similar things. They will have pure companions and will live there forever.
27. God does not shy away from using the example of a gnat or something even smaller. Those who believe know it is the truth from their Lord, but those who disbelieve say, "What does God mean by this example?" By it, He leads many astray and guides many, but He only leads astray the rebellious.
28. Those who break God's covenant after agreeing to it, and sever what God has ordered to be joined, and cause corruption on earth, are the losers.
29. How can you disbelieve in God when you were lifeless and He gave you life? Then He will cause you to die, then bring you back to life, and then you will return to Him.
30. He is the One who created everything on earth for you. Then He turned to the heavens and made them seven heavens. He has perfect knowledge of all things.
31. Remember when your Lord said to the angels, "I will place a vicegerent on earth." They said, "Will You place someone who will cause corruption and shed blood, while we praise and glorify You?" He said, "I know what you do not know."
32. He taught Adam the names of all things, then presented them to the angels and said, "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful."
33. They said, "Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."
34. He said, "O Adam, tell them their names." When Adam told them the names, God said, "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?"
35. When We said to the angels, "Prostrate before Adam," they all did, except Iblis. He refused and was arrogant, becoming one of the disbelievers.
36. We said, "O Adam, live with your wife in the Garden and eat freely from it, but do not go near this tree, or you will be among the wrongdoers."
37. But Satan made them slip and expelled them from the state they were in. We said, "Descend, as enemies to one another. On earth, you will have a place to live and provisions for a time."
38. Then Adam received words of inspiration from his Lord, and He turned to him in mercy. He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
39. We said, "Descend from here, all of you. When guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will have no fear, nor will they grieve."
40. But those who reject faith and deny Our signs will be companions of the Fire, where they will remain forever.
41. O Children of Israel, remember the special favor I bestowed upon you. Fulfill your covenant with Me, and I will fulfill Mine with you. Fear only Me.
42. Believe in what I have revealed, confirming the scriptures you already have. Do not be the first to reject it, nor sell My signs for a small price. Fear only Me.
43. Do not mix truth with falsehood or conceal the truth knowingly.
44. Be steadfast in prayer, give regular charity, and bow down with those who bow in worship.
45. Do you instruct others to be righteous while forgetting to practice it yourselves, even though you read the scriptures? Do you not understand?
46. Seek help through patience and prayer; it is difficult except for those who are humble and know they will meet their Lord and return to Him.
47. O Children of Israel, remember the favor I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over all other nations.
48. Guard yourselves against a day when no soul can help another, no intercession will be accepted, no compensation will be taken, and no one will be helped.
49. Remember when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who inflicted severe torment on you, killing your sons and sparing your women. That was a tremendous trial from your Lord.
50. We parted the sea for you, saved you, and drowned Pharaoh's people before your eyes.
51. We appointed forty nights for Moses, but in his absence, you took the calf for worship and did wrong.
52. Even then, We forgave you so you might be grateful.
53. We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion to guide you.
54. When Moses said to his people, "You have wronged yourselves by worshiping the calf, so repent to your Creator and kill the wrongdoers among you," He turned to you in mercy, for He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
55. When you said, "O Moses, we will not believe in you until we see God plainly," you were seized by lightning as you looked on.
56. Then We revived you after your death so you might give thanks.
57. We gave you shade from clouds and sent down manna and quails, saying, "Eat of the good things We have provided for you." But they rebelled, harming only themselves.
58. We said, "Enter this town and eat freely, but enter the gate with humility and say, 'Repentance.' We will forgive your sins and increase the reward for those who do good."
59. But the wrongdoers changed the word they were given, so We sent a plague from heaven upon them for their repeated disobedience.
60. When Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, "Strike the rock with your staff," and twelve springs gushed forth. Each group knew its own place for water. Eat and drink of God's sustenance and do not commit evil or mischief on the earth.
61. Then you said, "O Moses, we are tired of one kind of food. Ask your Lord to bring forth what the earth grows—herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions." Moses replied, "Would you exchange what is better for what is worse? Go to any town, and you will find what you want." They were covered with humiliation and misery and drew God's wrath upon themselves because they rejected His signs and killed His messengers without just cause. This was due to their disobedience and transgression.Anyone who believes in God and the Last Day and does good deeds—whether they are from the Jewish scriptures, Christians, or Sabians—will have their reward with their Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.

Remember when We took your covenant and raised Mount Sinai above you, saying, "Hold firmly to what We have given you and remember what is in it so that you may fear God." But you turned away afterward, and if it had not been for God's grace and mercy, you would have been among the losers.

You know about those who transgressed on the Sabbath. We said to them, "Be apes, despised and rejected." We made this an example for their time and for future generations, and a lesson for those who fear God.

When Moses said to his people, "God commands you to sacrifice a cow," they asked, "Are you making fun of us?" He replied, "I seek God's protection from being among the ignorant." They asked him to clarify what kind of cow, and he said, "It should be neither too old nor too young, but of middle age." They asked about its color, and he said, "It should be a bright yellow cow, pleasing to the eye." They asked for more details, and he said, "It should be a cow not used for plowing or watering fields, sound and without blemish." They finally agreed and sacrificed it, though they were reluctant.

Remember when you killed a man and disputed about it, but God revealed what you were hiding. We said, "Strike the body with a part of the cow." Thus, God brings the dead to life and shows you His signs so that you may understand. Even after this, your hearts became hardened like rocks or even harder. Some rocks have rivers gushing from them, some split and release water, and some fall down in awe of God. God is not unaware of what you do.

Do you hope they will believe you, knowing that some of them heard God's word and then deliberately altered it after understanding it? When they meet believers, they say, "We believe," but in private, they warn each other not to reveal what God has disclosed to them, fearing it will be used against them. Don't they realize that God knows what they conceal and what they reveal? Some among them are illiterate and only know the scripture through hearsay, making guesses. Woe to those who write the scripture with their own hands and then claim it is from God to gain a small profit. They will face consequences for their actions and the falsehoods they spread.

They say, "The Fire will only touch us for a few days." Ask them if they have a promise from God, for He never breaks His promises, or are they saying things about God they don't know? Those who commit evil and are surrounded by their sins are companions of the Fire, where they will remain. But those who believe and do good deeds are companions of the Garden, where they will stay forever.

Remember when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel: Worship only God, be kind to parents, relatives, orphans, and the needy, speak kindly to people, establish prayer, and give charity. Yet, most of you turned away, except for a few. We also commanded you not to shed each other's blood or expel each other from your homes, and you agreed to this covenant. However, you still kill each other and expel some from their homes, supporting each other in wrongdoing. If they come to you as captives, you ransom them, even though it was unlawful to expel them in the first place. Do you believe in part of the scripture and reject the rest? Those who do this will face disgrace in this life and severe punishment on the Day of Judgment. God is not unaware of what you do. These are the people who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.

We gave Moses the Book and sent messengers after him. We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Yet, whenever a messenger brought something you didn't desire, you grew arrogant, calling some liars and killing others. They say, "Our hearts are covered." But God has cursed them for their disbelief, and only a few believe. When a Book from God came to them, confirming what they already had, they refused to believe, even though they had previously prayed for victory over disbelievers. The curse of God is on those who reject faith.

They used to pray for victory over disbelievers, but when a prophet came to them with a message they didn't recognize, they rejected him. So, God's curse is on the unbelievers. They sold their souls for a miserable price by denying God's revelation out of envy that God would bestow His grace on whomever He pleases. They have drawn upon themselves wrath upon wrath, and a humiliating punishment awaits those who reject faith.

When told to believe in what God has sent down, they say, "We believe in what was sent to us," but they reject everything else, even if it confirms their own scriptures. Ask them, "Why did you kill God's prophets before if you truly believed?" Moses came to you with clear signs, yet you worshipped the calf in his absence and acted wrongfully. We took a covenant from you and raised Mount Sinai above you, saying, "Hold firmly to what We have given you and listen." But you said, "We hear and we disobey," and your hearts were filled with the love of the calf because of your disbelief. Say, "Evil indeed is what your faith commands you, if you have any faith!" Say, "If the Hereafter with God is exclusively for you and not for others, then wish for death if you are truthful." But they will never wish for it because of what their hands have sent before them. God knows the wrongdoers. You will find them the most greedy for life, even more than idolaters. Each one wishes to live a thousand years, but even such a long life will not save them from punishment. God sees all that they do.

Say, "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, who brings down the revelation to your heart by God's will, confirming what came before, and as guidance and glad tidings for believers, let them know that God is an enemy to those who reject faith." We have sent down clear signs, and only the perverse reject them. Every time they make a covenant, some of them throw it aside. Most of them do not believe. When a messenger from God came to them, confirming what they already had, a group of them threw the Book of God behind their backs as if they did not know it. They followed what the evil ones falsely attributed to Solomon's kingdom. Solomon did not disbelieve, but the evil ones did, teaching people magic and what was revealed to the two angels in Babylon, Harut and Marut. These angels did not teach anyone without first saying, "We are only a trial, so do not disbelieve." Yet people learned from them how to cause discord between a man and his wife. But they could not harm anyone except by God's permission. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them. They knew that whoever engaged in such practices would have no share in the Hereafter. Evil indeed was the price for which they sold their souls, if they only knew!

If they had believed and avoided evil, their reward from God would have been much better, if only they knew! Believers, don't use disrespectful words when addressing the Prophet. Instead, use respectful language and listen to him. For disbelievers, there is a severe punishment. Those who disbelieve, whether from the People of the Book or the pagans, do not want any good to come to you from your Lord. But God grants His mercy to whomever He wills, for He is full of grace.

None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We bring something better or similar. Don't you know that God has power over all things? Don't you know that God owns the dominion of the heavens and the earth? Besides Him, you have no guardian or helper. Would you question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever chooses disbelief over faith has clearly gone astray. Many of the People of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy, even after the truth has become clear to them. But forgive and overlook until God brings about His command. God has power over all things.

Be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity. Whatever good you send forth for your souls, you will find it with God. God sees everything you do. They say, "None shall enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian." These are their vain desires. Say, "Produce your proof if you are truthful." No, whoever submits himself entirely to God and does good will get his reward from his Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.

The Jews say, "The Christians have nothing to stand on," and the Christians say, "The Jews have nothing to stand on," even though they both read the same Book. Those who have no knowledge say the same. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences. Who is more unjust than the one who prevents people from worshipping God in His places of worship and strives to ruin them? Such people should not enter them except in fear. They will face disgrace in this world and severe punishment in the Hereafter. To God belong the east and the west. Wherever you turn, there is the presence of God. God is All-Pervading, All-Knowing.

They say, "God has taken a son." Glory be to Him! Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. All are subservient to Him. He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, "Be," and it is. Those without knowledge say, "Why doesn't God speak to us or send us a sign?" People before them said similar things. Their hearts are alike. We have made the signs clear for those who firmly believe. We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. You will not be questioned about the companions of the blazing fire. The Jews and the Christians will never be satisfied with you until you follow their religion. Say, "God's guidance is the only guidance." If you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you would have no protector or helper against God.The Jews and Christians will not be satisfied with you unless you follow their religion. Say: "The guidance of God is the true guidance." If you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you will find no protector or helper against God. Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it should be read. They are the ones who believe in it. Those who reject it are the losers. O Children of Israel, remember the favor I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over all others for My message. Guard yourselves against a day when no soul will benefit another, no compensation will be accepted, no intercession will help, and no one will be aided. Remember that Abraham was tested by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled. God said, "I will make you a leader for mankind." Abraham asked, "And from my offspring?" God replied, "My promise does not include wrongdoers." We made the House (Kaaba) a place of assembly and safety for people. Take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer. We commanded Abraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who walk around it, use it as a retreat, or bow and prostrate in prayer. Abraham prayed, "My Lord, make this a city of peace and provide its people with fruits—those who believe in God and the Last Day." God said, "As for those who disbelieve, I will let them enjoy for a while, then I will drive them to the torment of the Fire, an evil destination." When Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House, they prayed, "Our Lord, accept this from us. You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing." They also prayed, "Our Lord, make us submissive to You and from our descendants a nation submissive to You. Show us our ways of worship and turn to us in mercy. You are the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful." "Our Lord, send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite Your signs to them, teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise." Who would turn away from the religion of Abraham except someone who fools themselves? We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds." This was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob: "O my sons, God has chosen the faith for you, so do not die except as Muslims." Were you present when death approached Jacob? He asked his sons, "What will you worship after me?" They replied, "We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, the one true God. To Him, we submit." That was a people who have passed away. They will reap the fruit of what they did, and you of what you do. You will not be questioned about what they used to do. They say, "Become Jews or Christians if you want to be guided." Say, "No, we follow the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not an idolater." We follow the faith of Abraham, the monotheist, who was not an idolater. Say: "We believe in God and what was revealed to us, to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and to all the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we submit to God." If others believe as you do, they are rightly guided. If they turn away, they are in opposition, but God will protect you against them. He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. Our faith is the baptism of God, and who can baptize better than God? We worship Him alone. Say: "Do you argue with us about God when He is our Lord and your Lord? We are responsible for our deeds, and you for yours. We are sincere in our faith in Him." Do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: "Do you know better, or does God?" Who is more unjust than one who hides the testimony they have from God? God is not unaware of what you do. That was a people who have passed away. They will reap the fruit of what they did, and you of what you do. You will not be questioned about what they used to do. The foolish among the people will say: "What has turned them from the direction of prayer they used to face?" Say: "To God belong both the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path." Thus, We have made you a justly balanced nation so that you may be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over you. We appointed the direction of prayer you used to face only to test those who follow the Messenger from those who would turn back. It was a difficult test except for those whom God has guided. God would not let your faith go to waste, for He is full of kindness and mercy. We see you turning your face towards the heavens for guidance. Now We will turn you to a direction of prayer that pleases you. Turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. Wherever you are, turn your faces in that direction. Those who have been given the Scripture know that this is the truth from their Lord. God is not unaware of what they do. Even if you brought all the signs to the people of the Book, they would not follow your direction of prayer, nor will you follow theirs. They do not even follow each other's direction of prayer. If you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you would be among the wrongdoers. Those to whom We gave the Scripture recognize this as they recognize their own sons, but some of them knowingly conceal the truth. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be in doubt. Each has a goal to which God turns them. Strive together towards all that is good. Wherever you are, God will bring you together. He has power over all things. From wherever you start, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the truth from your Lord. God is not unaware of what you do. Wherever you are, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque when you pray. This way, people will have no reason to argue against you, except those who are unjust. Do not fear them, but fear Me, so that I may complete My favor upon you and guide you. We have sent among you a Messenger from your own people, who recites Our revelations to you, purifies you, and teaches you the Scripture and wisdom, and new knowledge. Remember Me, and I will remember you. Be grateful to Me and do not reject faith. O believers, seek help through patience and prayer. God is with those who patiently persevere. Do not say of those who are killed in the way of God, "They are dead." No, they are alive, but you do not perceive it. We will test you with fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives, and crops. But give good news to those who patiently persevere, who say when afflicted with calamity, "To God we belong, and to Him we will return." They are the ones who receive blessings and mercy from their Lord, and they are rightly guided. Safa and Marwa are among the symbols of God. There is no sin for those who visit the House during the pilgrimage or at other times to go around them. Whoever does good voluntarily, God is All-Knowing and Appreciative. Those who conceal the clear signs and guidance We have revealed, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book, are cursed by God and those entitled to curse. Except those who repent, make amends, and openly declare the truth. To them, I turn in mercy, for I am the Most Merciful. Those who reject faith and die rejecting it are cursed by God, the angels, and all mankind. They will abide in it; their penalty will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved. Your God is One God; there is no god but Him, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. In the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, the sailing of ships through the ocean for the benefit of mankind, the rain God sends down to revive the earth, the animals He scatters, the changing of the winds, and the clouds between the sky and the earth, are signs for people who understand. Yet some people take others as equals to God, loving them as they should love God. But those of faith are stronger in their love for God. If only the unrighteous could see the penalty, they would realize that all power belongs to God, and He is severe in punishment. On that day, those who were followed will disown their followers, and they will see the penalty, and all their ties will be cut off. Those who followed will say, "If only we had one more chance, we would disown them as they have disowned us." Thus, God will show them their deeds as regrets, and there will be no way out of the Fire for them. People will regret their actions and won't escape the Fire. O humanity! Eat what is lawful and good on earth, and don't follow the devil's footsteps; he is your clear enemy. He commands you to do evil and shameful deeds and to say things about God without knowledge. When told to follow what God has revealed, they say, "We follow what our ancestors did," even if their ancestors lacked wisdom and guidance. Those who reject faith are like those who hear nothing but calls and cries; they are deaf, dumb, and blind, lacking understanding. Believers, eat the good things provided for you and be grateful to God if you truly worship Him. God has only forbidden dead meat, blood, pork, and anything dedicated to other than God. But if someone is forced by necessity without willful disobedience, they are guiltless. God is Forgiving and Merciful. Those who conceal God's revelations for a small gain consume nothing but fire. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them; they will face a painful punishment. They trade guidance for error and forgiveness for torment, showing boldness towards the Fire. This is because God revealed the Book with truth, and those who dispute it are in great opposition. True righteousness is not about facing east or west, but believing in God, the Last Day, the angels, the...Book, and the prophets. True righteousness is about giving wealth out of love for God to relatives, orphans, the needy, travelers, and freeing slaves. It involves maintaining prayer, giving charity, keeping promises, and being patient in adversity. These are the truthful and God-fearing.

Believers, the law of equality in cases of murder is prescribed: a free person for a free person, a slave for a slave, and a woman for a woman. If the victim's family forgives, then follow the proper procedure and compensate them kindly. This is a mercy from your Lord. Whoever exceeds this limit will face severe punishment. The law of equality saves lives, so you may restrain yourselves.

When death approaches, it is prescribed to make a fair bequest to parents and close relatives. This is a duty for the God-fearing. If anyone changes the will after hearing it, the guilt is on those who change it. God hears and knows all things. If someone fears injustice from the testator and makes peace between the parties, there is no sin on them. God is Forgiving and Merciful.

Believers, fasting is prescribed for you as it was for those before you, so you may learn self-restraint. Fast for a specific number of days, but if you are ill or traveling, make up the same number of days later. For those who can only fast with difficulty, they can feed a needy person as a ransom. However, fasting is better for you if you understand. The month of Ramadan is when the Qur'an was revealed as guidance for humanity and clear signs for judgment. Anyone present during this month should fast, but if you are ill or traveling, make up the days later. God wants ease for you, not hardship, so you can complete the prescribed period and glorify Him for His guidance, and perhaps you will be grateful.

When My servants ask about Me, I am near. I respond to the call of the one who prays to Me. Let them respond to Me and believe in Me so they may be guided. During the nights of fasting, it is permitted to be intimate with your spouses. They are like garments for you, and you are like garments for them. God knows you used to deceive yourselves, but He has forgiven you. So now, be intimate with them and seek what God has ordained for you. Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black thread of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. Do not be intimate with your spouses while you are in retreat in the mosques. These are the limits set by God, so do not approach them. God makes His signs clear to people so they may learn self-restraint.

Do not consume each other's property unjustly or use it to bribe judges to wrongfully consume a portion of others' property. They ask you about the new moons. Say: They are signs to mark fixed periods of time for people and for pilgrimage. It is not righteousness to enter houses from the back; righteousness is to fear God. Enter houses through their proper doors and fear God so you may prosper.

Fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; God does not love transgressors. Kill them wherever you find them and drive them out from where they drove you out, for persecution is worse than killing. Do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they fight you there; if they fight you, then kill them. This is the reward for those who suppress faith. But if they cease, God is Forgiving and Merciful. Fight them until there is no more persecution and religion is for God. If they cease, let there be no hostility except against the wrongdoers. The prohibited month is for the prohibited month, and for all things prohibited, there is the law of equality. If anyone transgresses against you, transgress likewise against them. Retaliate in the same way if someone attacks you, but always be mindful of God. Know that God is with those who practice self-restraint.

Spend your wealth in the cause of God and do not lead yourselves to destruction. Do good, for God loves those who do good. Complete the Hajj or 'Umra for God. If you are prevented from doing so, send an offering for sacrifice and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination. If you are ill or have a scalp ailment, compensate by fasting, feeding the poor, or offering a sacrifice. When you are safe, if you continue 'Umra to Hajj, make an offering you can afford. If you cannot afford it, fast for three days during Hajj and seven days upon your return, making ten days in total. This applies to those whose households are not near the Sacred Mosque. Be mindful of God, for He is strict in punishment.

Hajj is during well-known months. Whoever undertakes this duty should avoid obscenity, wickedness, and quarrels. Whatever good you do, God knows it. Take provisions for the journey, but the best provision is right conduct. So fear Me, O wise ones. It is not a sin to seek the bounty of your Lord during pilgrimage. When you descend from Mount Arafat, remember God at the Sacred Monument and praise Him as He has guided you, even though you were previously astray. Hasten onward from where the multitude hastens and ask for God's forgiveness. God is Forgiving and Merciful.

When you have completed your holy rites, celebrate God's praises as you used to celebrate your ancestors, but with greater devotion. Some people say, 'Our Lord, give us in this world,' but they will have no portion in the Hereafter. Others say, 'Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.' They will receive a portion of what they have earned, and God is swift in reckoning.

Remember God during the appointed days. If anyone hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if anyone stays on, there is no blame on him, provided his aim is to do right. Fear God and know that you will be gathered unto Him. There are people whose speech about this world's life may dazzle you, and they call God to witness what is in their hearts, yet they are the most contentious of enemies. When they turn away, their aim is to spread mischief on earth and destroy crops and cattle. God does not love mischief. When it is said to them, 'Fear God,' they are led by arrogance to more crime. Hell is enough for them, an evil resting place. There are also those who give their lives to earn the pleasure of God. God is full of kindness to His devotees.

Among people, there are those who dedicate themselves to seeking God's pleasure, and God is kind to His servants. Believers, embrace Islam fully and do not follow the devil's footsteps, for he is your clear enemy. If you turn back after receiving clear signs, know that God is powerful and wise. Are they waiting for God to come to them in clouds with angels, and the matter to be settled? All matters return to God for judgment. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We sent them. If anyone changes God's favor after it has come to them, God is strict in punishment.

The life of this world is attractive to those who reject faith, and they mock believers. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection, as God gives abundantly to whom He wills. Humanity was once a single community, and God sent messengers with good news and warnings, and revealed the Book to judge between people in their disputes. Those who received the Book differed out of selfishness, but God guided the believers to the truth. God guides whom He wills to a straight path.

Do you think you will enter paradise without facing trials like those before you? They faced suffering and adversity, and were so shaken that even the Messenger and the believers with him asked, "When will God's help come?" Indeed, God's help is near. They ask what they should spend in charity. Say: Whatever you spend should be for parents, relatives, orphans, the needy, and travelers. Whatever good you do, God knows it well.

Fighting is prescribed for you, though you dislike it. It may be that you dislike something good for you, and love something bad for you. God knows, and you do not. They ask about fighting during the sacred month. Say: Fighting in it is a grave matter, but hindering people from God's path, denying Him, and expelling people from the Sacred Mosque are graver. Persecution is worse than killing. They will not stop fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. Whoever turns back and dies in disbelief, their deeds will be in vain in this world and the Hereafter, and they will be companions of the Fire, abiding there forever.

Those who believe, emigrate, and strive in God's path have hope for God's mercy. God is forgiving and merciful. They ask about wine and gambling. Say: There is great sin in both, and some benefit for people, but the sin is greater than the benefit. They ask what they should spend. Say: Spend what is beyond your needs. Thus, God makes His signs clear to you so that you may reflect.

Regarding this life and the Hereafter, they ask you about orphans. Say: "The best thing to do is what benefits them. If you mix their affairs with yours, they are your brothers. God knows who intends harm and who means well. If God had wanted, He could have made things difficult for you. He is powerful and wise." Do not marry unbelieving women until they believe. A believing slave woman is better than an unbelieving woman, even if she attracts you. Similarly, do not marry your daughters to unbelievers until they believe. A believing slave man is better than an unbelieving man, even if he attracts you.Unbelievers lead you to the Fire, but God calls you to Paradise and forgiveness by His grace. He makes His signs clear so that people may remember. They ask you about menstruation. Say: "It is a discomfort, so keep away from women during their periods and do not approach them until they are clean. When they have purified themselves, you may approach them as God has commanded. God loves those who turn to Him and those who keep themselves pure." Your wives are like a field for you, so approach your field whenever and however you wish. But do some good for your souls beforehand and fear God. Know that you will meet Him, and give good news to the believers. Do not use God's name in your oaths to hinder you from doing good, acting rightly, or making peace between people. God hears and knows everything. God will not hold you accountable for unintentional oaths, but He will hold you accountable for what is in your hearts. He is forgiving and forbearing. For those who swear to abstain from their wives, a waiting period of four months is ordained. If they return, God is forgiving and merciful. But if they decide on divorce, God hears and knows everything. Divorced women should wait for three monthly periods before remarrying. They should not hide what God has created in their wombs if they believe in God and the Last Day. Their husbands have the right to take them back during this period if they wish for reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those of men, but men have a degree of responsibility over them. God is powerful and wise. Divorce is permissible twice. After that, the couple should either stay together on fair terms or separate kindly. It is not lawful for men to take back any gifts given to their wives, except when both parties fear they cannot keep God's limits. If this is the case, there is no blame if the wife gives something for her freedom. These are God's limits, so do not transgress them. Those who do are wrongdoers. If a husband divorces his wife irrevocably, he cannot remarry her until she marries another man and he divorces her. If this happens, there is no blame if they reunite, provided they can keep God's limits. These are God's limits, which He makes clear to those who understand. If a man divorces his wife, she is not allowed to remarry him until she marries another man and that marriage ends. If they both believe they can follow God's rules, they can remarry. When you divorce women and they complete their waiting period, either take them back kindly or let them go kindly. Do not take them back to harm them or take advantage of them, as this wrongs your own soul. Do not treat God's signs as a joke, but remember His blessings and the wisdom He has given you. Fear God and know that He is aware of everything. When you divorce women and they finish their waiting period, do not prevent them from remarrying their former husbands if they agree on fair terms. This advice is for those who believe in God and the Last Day. It is better and purer for you, and God knows what you do not. Mothers should breastfeed their children for two full years if the father wishes to complete the term. The father must provide for the mother's food and clothing fairly. No one should be burdened beyond their capacity. A mother should not be harmed because of her child, nor should a father. If both parents agree to wean the child by mutual consent, there is no blame on them. If you decide to hire a wet-nurse, there is no blame as long as you pay fairly. Fear God and know that He sees everything you do. If any of you die and leave widows, they should wait for four months and ten days before remarrying. After this period, there is no blame if they act in a just and reasonable manner. God is well aware of what you do. There is no blame if you hint at a proposal of marriage or keep it in your heart. God knows you will think of them. Do not make secret promises, but speak honorably and do not finalize the marriage until the waiting period is over. Know that God knows what is in your hearts, so be mindful of Him. God is forgiving and patient. There is no blame if you divorce women before consummation or setting a dowry. Provide for them according to your means, whether you are wealthy or poor. This is a duty for those who wish to do the right thing. If you divorce them before consummation but after setting a dowry, give them half of the agreed amount unless they or the man holding the marriage tie choose to forgo it. Forgoing is closer to righteousness. Do not forget to be generous to each other, for God sees everything you do. Guard your prayers, especially the middle prayer, and stand before God with devotion. If you fear an enemy, pray on foot or while riding, but when you are safe, remember God in the way He has taught you. If you are in danger, you can pray on foot or on horseback. When you are safe again, remember God as He has taught you what you did not know before. Those of you who die and leave widows should provide for them a year's maintenance and residence. If they choose to leave, there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves, as long as it is reasonable. God is powerful and wise. For divorced women, maintenance should be provided on a reasonable scale. This is a duty for the righteous. God makes His signs clear to you so that you may understand. Have you not seen those who fled their homes in thousands for fear of death? God said to them, "Die," and then brought them back to life. God is full of bounty to mankind, but most people are ungrateful. Fight in the cause of God, and know that He hears and knows everything. Who will lend to God a goodly loan, which He will multiply many times? God gives and withholds wealth, and to Him you will return. Have you not seen the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses? They asked a prophet among them to appoint a king so they could fight in the cause of God. The prophet asked if they would refuse to fight if commanded. They said they would fight since they were driven from their homes and families. But when fighting was prescribed, they turned back except for a few. God knows the wrongdoers. Their prophet told them that God appointed Talut (Saul) as their king. They questioned his authority due to his lack of wealth. The prophet said God chose him and gave him knowledge and physical strength. God grants His authority to whom He pleases. The prophet also said a sign of Talut's authority would be the return of the Ark of the Covenant, carried by angels, containing peace and relics from the families of Moses and Aaron. This would be a sign for believers. When Talut set out with his army, he told them God would test them at a river. Those who drank from it would not be part of his army, except those who took only a sip. Most drank, except a few. When they crossed the river, they felt they couldn't face Goliath and his forces. But those who believed in meeting God said that small groups often overcome large ones with God's help. God is with the steadfast. When they faced Goliath, they prayed for patience, firm steps, and help against the disbelievers. By God's will, they defeated them, and David killed Goliath. God gave David power, wisdom, and taught him what He willed. If God did not check some people by means of others, the earth would be full of mischief. God is full of bounty to all the worlds. If God did not balance some people against others, the earth would be corrupted. But God is kind to His creatures. By God's permission, they defeated their enemies, and David killed Goliath. God granted David kingship, wisdom, and taught him what He willed. If God did not check some people by means of others, the earth would be full of mischief. God is gracious to all. These are the signs of God, which we recite to you in truth. You are indeed one of the messengers. We have favored some messengers over others. To some, God spoke directly; others He raised in rank. We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If God had willed, the generations after them would not have fought each other after receiving clear signs. But they chose to dispute, some believing and others rejecting. If God had willed, they would not have fought, but God does what He intends. O believers, spend from what We have provided for you before a day comes when there will be no bargaining, friendship, or intercession. Disbelievers are the wrongdoers. God! There is no god but Him, the Living, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. Who can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before and behind them, and they cannot grasp any of His knowledge except what He wills. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and He never tires of preserving them. He is the Most High, the Supreme. There is no compulsion in religion. The right path is clear from the wrong. Whoever rejects false gods and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that never breaks. God hears and knows everything. God is the protector of those who believe. He brings them out of darkness into light. As for those who disbelieve, their patrons are false gods who lead them from light into darkness. They are the companions of the fire, where they will remain forever. Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him power? Abraham said, "My Lord is the one who gives life and death." The man said, "I give life and death." Abraham said, "God causes the sun to rise from the east, so make it rise from the west." The disbeliever was confounded. God does not guide the unjust. Or consider the one who passed by a ruined town and wondered how God would bring it back to life. God caused him to die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life.God caused him to die for a hundred years, then revived him. God asked, "How long have you been here?" He replied, "A day or part of a day." God said, "No, you have been here for a hundred years. Look at your food and drink; they have not decayed. Look at your donkey. We will make you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh." When this was made clear to him, he said, "I know that God has power over all things."

When Abraham asked, "Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead," God replied, "Do you not believe?" Abraham said, "Yes, but to reassure my heart." God said, "Take four birds, train them to come to you, then cut them into pieces and scatter them on different hills. Then call them; they will come to you swiftly. Know that God is Mighty, Wise."

The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of God is like a grain of corn that grows seven ears, each with a hundred grains. God multiplies the reward for whom He wills. God is All-Encompassing and All-Knowing. Those who spend their wealth for God's cause and do not follow their charity with reminders of their generosity or harm will have their reward with their Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve. Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. God is Self-Sufficient and Forbearing.

Believers, do not nullify your charity by reminders of your generosity or by causing harm, like those who spend their wealth to be seen by people and do not believe in God or the Last Day. They are like a hard, barren rock with a little soil on it; when heavy rain falls, it leaves the rock bare. They gain nothing from what they have earned. God does not guide disbelievers. Those who spend their wealth seeking to please God and to strengthen their souls are like a garden on a fertile hill. Heavy rain makes it yield double the harvest, and even if it receives only light rain, it still produces. God sees everything you do.

Would any of you like to have a garden of date palms and vines with rivers flowing underneath, full of all kinds of fruit, but then old age strikes and your children are weak, and a fiery whirlwind destroys it? This is how God makes His signs clear to you so that you may reflect. Believers, give from the good things you have earned and from what We have produced for you from the earth. Do not aim to give what is bad when you would not accept it yourselves unless you closed your eyes to it. Know that God is Self-Sufficient and Praiseworthy.

Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to be stingy, while God promises you forgiveness and abundance. God is All-Encompassing and All-Knowing. He grants wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever is granted wisdom has indeed received abundant good. But only those with understanding will remember. Whatever you spend in charity or vow to give, God knows it all. Wrongdoers will have no helpers. If you disclose your charity, it is good, but if you conceal it and give it to those in need, it is better for you. It will remove some of your sins. God is well aware of what you do.

It is not your responsibility to guide them, but God guides whom He wills. Whatever good you give benefits your own souls, and you should only do so seeking the "Face" of God. Whatever good you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged. Charity is for those in need who are restricted in God's cause and cannot move about in the land seeking trade or work. The ignorant think they are free from want because of their modesty. Charity is meant for those who are struggling in God's cause and cannot travel for trade. People might think they are well-off because they don't beg, but you can recognize them by their modesty. Whatever good you give, God knows it well. Those who give in charity, whether in secret or openly, day or night, will be rewarded by their Lord. They will have no fear or grief.

People who consume usury will stand like someone driven to madness by the devil. They claim that trade is like usury, but God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who stop after receiving guidance from their Lord will be forgiven for the past. Their case is with God. But those who continue are companions of the Fire, where they will remain. God removes blessings from usury but increases them for charity. He does not love the ungrateful and wicked. Those who believe, do good deeds, establish regular prayers, and give regular charity will be rewarded by their Lord. They will have no fear or grief.

Believers, fear God and give up any remaining usury if you truly believe. If you do not, be warned of war from God and His Messenger. If you repent, you can keep your principal without interest. Do not wrong others, and you will not be wronged. If a debtor is in difficulty, give them time until it is easy for them to repay. If you forgive the debt as charity, it is better for you if you only knew. Fear the Day when you will be brought back to God. Every soul will be paid what it earned, and no one will be wronged.

Believers, when you deal with each other in transactions involving future obligations, write them down. Let a scribe write it faithfully between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as God has taught him. Let the one who incurs the liability dictate, fearing God and not diminishing anything. If the liable party is mentally deficient, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate faithfully. Get two witnesses from your men, or one man and two women if two men are not available, so that if one forgets, the other can remind her. Witnesses should not refuse when called upon. Do not disdain writing down your contracts, whether small or large, with the time of repayment. This is more just in God's sight, more suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts. If it is a transaction carried out on the spot, there is no blame if you do not write it down. But take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract, and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If you do harm, it is wickedness in you. Fear God, for He teaches you, and He knows all things.

If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession may serve the purpose. If one of you entrusts something to another, let the trustee discharge their trust faithfully and fear God. Do not conceal evidence, for whoever does so has a sinful heart. God knows all that you do. If you are on a journey and can't find a scribe, a pledge with possession can serve the purpose. If you trust someone with something, let the trustee fulfill their duty faithfully and fear God. Do not hide evidence; whoever does so has a sinful heart, and God knows all that you do.

Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God. Whether you reveal or conceal your thoughts, God will hold you accountable. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, for He has power over all things. The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the believers. They all believe in God, His angels, His books, and His messengers, saying, "We make no distinction between any of His messengers." They say, "We hear and obey. Grant us Your forgiveness, our Lord. To You is the final return."

God does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. It will have what it has earned, and it will bear what it has done wrong. Pray: "Our Lord, do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, do not place on us burdens like those You placed on those before us. Our Lord, do not impose on us what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector, so help us against those who deny the truth."

Chapter 3: AL-E-IMRAN (THE FAMILY OF 'IMRAN, THE HOUSE OF 'IMRAN)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A. L. M. God! There is no god but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. He sent down to you the Book in truth, confirming what came before it. He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) as guidance for humanity, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong). Those who reject faith in the signs of God will face severe punishment, for God is Exalted in Might and Lord of Retribution. Nothing is hidden from God, whether on earth or in the heavens. He shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.

He sent down to you the Book with clear verses that are the foundation of the Book, and others that are allegorical. Those with perversity in their hearts follow the allegorical parts, seeking discord and hidden meanings, but no one knows their true meanings except God. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say, "We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord," and only people of understanding will grasp the message. They pray, "Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate after You have guided us. Grant us mercy from Your presence, for You are the Grantor of bounties without measure." "Our Lord, You will gather all humanity on a day about which there is no doubt. God never fails in His promise."

Those who reject faith, neither their possessions nor their children will help them against God. They are but fuel for the Fire. Just like the people of Pharaoh and those before them, who denied our signs, God punished them for their sins. God is strict in punishment. Tell those who reject faith that they will soon be defeated and gathered in Hell, a terrible place to be. There was a sign for you in the two armies that mIn the battle, one group fought for God while the other resisted Him. The believers saw their enemies as twice their number, and God supports whom He wills. This is a lesson for those who can see. People are drawn to desires like women, children, wealth, and property. These are the comforts of this worldly life, but with God is the best place to return to. Say: Shall I tell you about something better than these? For the righteous, there are gardens with their Lord, with rivers flowing beneath, where they will live forever, with pure companions and God's pleasure. God sees His servants. These are the ones who say, "Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire." They are patient, truthful, obedient, and spend in charity. They pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning. God bears witness that there is no god but Him, as do the angels and those with knowledge, upholding justice. There is no god but Him, the Almighty, the Wise. The true religion with God is Islam. Those who were given the Book only differed after knowledge came to them, out of envy among themselves. Whoever denies the signs of God will find that God is swift in reckoning. If they argue with you, say: "I have submitted myself to God, and so have those who follow me." Ask those who were given the Book and the unlearned: "Do you also submit?" If they submit, they are rightly guided, but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message. God sees His servants. Those who deny the signs of God and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those who advocate justice among people, announce to them a painful punishment. Their deeds will bear no fruit in this world or the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God to settle their disputes, but a group of them turns away in defiance. This is because they say, "The Fire will only touch us for a few days." Their own lies deceive them about their religion. But how will it be when We gather them on a day about which there is no doubt, and every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, without injustice? Say: "O God, Lord of Power and Rule, You give power to whom You please, and You take it away from whom You please. You honor whom You please, and You bring low whom You please. In Your hand is all good. You have power over all things." "O God, Master of all power and authority! You give power to whom You will and take it away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and humble whom You will. All good is in Your hands, and You have power over everything. You make the night merge into the day and the day merge into the night. You bring the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living. You provide sustenance to whom You will without limit. Believers should not take disbelievers as friends over believers. Whoever does this has no connection with God unless it is to protect themselves. God warns you to remember Him, for the final return is to Him. Say: Whether you hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, God knows it all. He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and He has power over everything. On the Day when every soul will see all the good and evil it has done, it will wish there was a great distance between it and its evil. God warns you to remember Him, and He is kind to His servants. Say: If you love God, follow me, and God will love you and forgive your sins. God is Forgiving and Merciful. Say: Obey God and His Messenger. If they turn away, God does not love those who reject faith. God chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people. They were descendants of one another, and God hears and knows all things. Remember when the wife of 'Imran said: "O my Lord! I dedicate what is in my womb to Your service. Accept it from me, for You hear and know all things." When she gave birth, she said: "O my Lord! I have given birth to a female." God knew best what she had delivered. "The male is not like the female. I have named her Mary, and I seek Your protection for her and her offspring from the Evil One." Her Lord accepted her graciously, made her grow in purity and beauty, and assigned her to the care of Zakariya. Whenever Zakariya visited her in her chamber, he found her with sustenance. He asked: "O Mary! Where does this come from?" She replied: "It is from God. God provides sustenance to whom He pleases without measure." There, Zakariya prayed to his Lord, saying: "O my Lord! Grant me from You a pure offspring. You hear all prayers." While he was praying, the angels called to him: "God gives you glad tidings of Yahya, who will confirm a word from God, be noble, chaste, and a prophet among the righteous." Zakariya said: "O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old and my wife is barren?" The answer came: "God does what He wills." He said: "O my Lord! Give me a sign." The answer was: "Your sign is that you will not speak to people for three days except by gestures. Remember your Lord often and glorify Him in the evening and morning." The angels said: "O Mary! God has chosen you, purified you, and chosen you above all women of the nations. O Mary! Worship your Lord devoutly, prostrate yourself, and bow down with those who bow down." "O Mary, be devoted to your Lord, prostrate yourself, and bow with those who bow in worship." This is part of the unseen knowledge that We reveal to you, O Messenger. You were not present when they cast lots to decide who would take care of Mary, nor were you there when they argued about it. The angels said, "O Mary, God gives you good news of a Word from Him. His name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, honored in this world and the Hereafter, and among those closest to God. He will speak to people in his infancy and adulthood and will be among the righteous." Mary asked, "My Lord, how can I have a son when no man has touched me?" He replied, "God creates what He wills. When He decrees something, He simply says, 'Be,' and it is." God will teach him the Book, wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel. He will be a messenger to the Children of Israel, saying, "I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. I will create for you a bird from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a bird by God's permission. I will heal the blind and the leper and bring the dead to life by God's permission. I will tell you what you eat and what you store in your houses. Surely, this is a sign for you if you believe. I have come to confirm the Torah that came before me and to make lawful some of what was forbidden to you. I come with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me. God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path." When Jesus sensed disbelief among them, he asked, "Who will be my helpers in God's cause?" The disciples replied, "We are God's helpers. We believe in God, and bear witness that we are Muslims. Our Lord, we believe in what You have revealed and follow the Messenger, so write us among those who bear witness." The disbelievers plotted, and God also planned. God is the best of planners. God said, "O Jesus, I will take you and raise you to Myself, purify you from those who disbelieve, and make your followers superior to the disbelievers until the Day of Resurrection. Then you will all return to Me, and I will judge between you regarding your differences. As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them severely in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. But those who believe and do good deeds, God will reward them fully. God does not love wrongdoers. This is what We recite to you of the signs and the wise reminder. The likeness of Jesus before God is like that of Adam. He created him from dust and then said to him, 'Be,' and he was. This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among those who doubt. If anyone disputes with you about this after knowledge has come to you, say, 'Come, let us gather our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then let us pray earnestly and invoke God's curse on those who lie.'" "Say: 'O People of the Book! Come to a common understanding between us: that we worship none but God, that we do not associate any partners with Him, and that none of us takes others as lords besides God.' If they turn away, then say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims (submitting to God's will).' O People of the Book! Why do you argue about Abraham when the Torah and the Gospel were revealed after him? Do you not understand? You argue about things you know, but why argue about things you do not know? God knows, and you do not. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian; he was a true believer who submitted to God, and he was not an idolater. The closest people to Abraham are those who follow him, this Prophet, and those who believe. God is the Protector of the believers. A group among the People of the Book wishes to lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray without realizing it. O People of the Book! Why do you reject the signs of God when you witness them? Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth knowingly? A group among the People of the Book says: 'Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers, but reject it at the end of the day, so they may turn back.' They say: 'Believe only in those who follow your religion.' Say: 'True guidance is God's guidance.' They fear that a revelation similar to theirs might be sent to someone else, or that others might argue with them before their Lord. Say: 'All bounties are in God's hand; He grants them to whom He pleases. God is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.' God selects for His mercy whom He wills. God is the Lord of great bounty."Among the People of the Book, some are trustworthy with a hoard of gold and will return it, while others, if entrusted with a single coin, will not return it unless you constantly demand it. They say: "We have no obligation to the unlearned people." They lie against God knowingly. Those who keep their promises and act righteously, God loves those who act righteously. Those who sell their faith and their promises to God for a small price will have no share in the Hereafter. God will not speak to them, look at them, or purify them on the Day of Judgment. They will have a painful punishment. Among them is a group who distort the Book with their tongues, making you think it is part of the Book when it is not. They say: "This is from God," but it is not from God. They knowingly lie against God.

Some people distort the Book with their tongues to make you think it is from God, but it is not. They lie about God knowingly. It is not possible for someone who has been given the Book, wisdom, and prophethood to tell people to worship him instead of God. Instead, he would say, "Be devoted servants of the Lord because you have taught and studied the Book." Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets as lords. Would he lead you to disbelief after you have submitted to God? God made a covenant with the prophets, saying, "I give you a Book and wisdom. Then, when a messenger comes to you confirming what you have, you must believe in him and help him." They agreed, and God said, "Bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses." If anyone turns back after this, they are transgressors. Do they seek a religion other than God's, when everything in the heavens and earth submits to Him, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will return?

Say, "We believe in God and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to God we submit." If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from them, and in the Hereafter, they will be among the losers. How will God guide those who reject faith after accepting it and bearing witness that the Messenger is true, and after clear signs have come to them? God does not guide unjust people. Their reward is the curse of God, His angels, and all mankind. They will dwell in it; their penalty will not be lightened, nor will they be reprieved. Except for those who repent and make amends, for God is Forgiving, Merciful. But those who reject faith after accepting it and continue in their disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted. They are the ones who have gone astray. Those who disbelieve and die in disbelief, even if they offered the earth full of gold as a ransom, it would not be accepted. They will have a painful punishment and no helpers.

You will not attain righteousness unless you give freely of what you love. Whatever you give, God knows it well. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel made unlawful for himself before the Law of Moses was revealed. Say, "Bring the Law and study it if you are truthful." If anyone invents a lie and attributes it to God after this, they are unjust wrong-doers. Say, "God speaks the truth. Follow the religion of Abraham, the upright one; he was not a polytheist." The first house of worship established for humanity was at Bekka, blessed and a source of guidance for all nations. It contains clear signs, such as the Station of Abraham. Whoever enters it finds safety. Pilgrimage to this House is a duty owed to God by those who can afford the journey. If anyone denies this, know that God is independent of all creatures.

Say, "O People of the Book! Why do you reject the signs of God when He is a witness to all you do?" Say, "O People of the Scripture! Why do you obstruct those who believe from the path of God, seeking to make it crooked, while you are witnesses to God's guidance? God is not unaware of what you do." O believers! If you listen to a faction among the People of the Book, they will turn you into disbelievers after you have believed. How can you deny faith when God's revelations are recited to you, and His Messenger is among you? Whoever holds firmly to God will be guided to the right path.

O believers! Fear God as He should be feared, and do not die except as Muslims. Hold firmly to the rope of God all together and do not be divided. Remember God's favor upon you when you were enemies, and He united your hearts so that you became brothers by His grace. You were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you from it. Thus, God makes His signs clear to you so that you may be guided. Let there arise from among you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong. They are the ones who will be successful. Do not be like those who became divided and disputed after clear signs had come to them. For them, there is a dreadful penalty. On the Day when some faces will be bright and some faces will be dark, it will be said to those with darkened faces, "Did you reject faith after accepting it? Taste the penalty for rejecting faith." But those with bright faces will be in God's mercy, dwelling there forever. These are the signs of God, which we recite to you in truth. God does not wish any injustice to His creatures. To God belongs everything in the heavens and on earth, and to Him all matters return.

You are the best community raised for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in God. If the People of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers, but most of them are transgressors. They will not harm you except for a slight annoyance. If they fight you, they will turn and flee, and they will not be helped. Shame will be upon them wherever they are found, except when they are under a covenant of protection from God and from men. They have drawn upon themselves the wrath of God, and humiliation is upon them because they rejected the signs of God and killed the prophets unjustly. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed beyond bounds. Not all of them are alike. Among the People of the Book, there is a group that stands for the right. They recite the signs of God all night long and prostrate themselves in adoration. Not all of them are the same; among the People of the Book, there is a group that stands for what is right. They recite God's messages during the night and bow in worship. They believe in God and the Last Day, encourage what is right, and prevent what is wrong. They compete in doing good deeds and are among the righteous. Whatever good they do will not be rejected; God knows well those who do right.

As for those who reject faith, neither their wealth nor their children will help them against God. They will be companions of the Fire, dwelling there forever. What they spend in this life is like a cold wind that destroys the harvest of people who have wronged themselves. It is not God who wrongs them, but they wrong themselves. Believers, do not take outsiders as close friends; they will not fail to corrupt you. They desire your ruin, and hatred has already appeared from their mouths. What their hearts conceal is even worse. We have made the signs clear to you if you have wisdom. You love them, but they do not love you. You believe in the entire Book, but when they meet you, they say, "We believe." When they are alone, they bite their fingers in rage against you. Say, "Perish in your rage; God knows well all the secrets of the heart." If something good happens to you, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls you, they rejoice. But if you are patient and do right, their schemes will not harm you at all. God encompasses all that they do.

Remember when you left your household early to position the believers for battle, and God heard and knew all things. When two of your groups almost lost courage, God was their protector. In God, the faithful should put their trust. God helped you at Badr when you were a small, weak force. So, fear God so that you may show gratitude. Remember when you said to the believers, "Is it not enough that God should help you with three thousand angels sent down?" Yes, if you remain firm and act rightly, even if the enemy rushes at you, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels making a terrific onslaught. God made this a message of hope for you and an assurance to your hearts. Victory comes only from God, the Exalted, the Wise. He might cut off a portion of the disbelievers or expose them to infamy, turning them back frustrated. It is not for you to decide whether He turns in mercy to them or punishes them; they are indeed wrongdoers. To God belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases; God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Believers, do not consume usury, doubling and multiplying it. Fear God so that you may prosper. Guard yourselves against the Fire prepared for disbelievers. Obey God and the Messenger so that you may obtain mercy. Strive for forgiveness from your Lord and for a paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who are mindful of God. These are the ones who give generously in both good times and bad, who control their anger, and who forgive others. God loves those who do good. Those who remember God and seek forgiveness after committing a sin or wronging themselves, and who do not persist in their wrongdoing, will find forgiveness from God.Their reward will be gardens with rivers flowing beneath them, where they will live forever. What a great reward for those who strive to do good! Many ways of life have passed before you. Travel the earth and see the fate of those who denied the truth. This is a clear message for humanity, a guidance and a warning for those who are mindful of God. Do not lose heart or despair; if you are true believers, you will prevail. If you have been hurt, know that others have been hurt as well. Such days of varying fortunes are given to people so that God may know who truly believes and who does not. God does not love wrongdoers. God's purpose is to test those who believe and to purify them, while depriving the disbelievers of blessings. Did you think you would enter paradise without God testing those of you who fought hard and remained steadfast? Muhammad is just a messenger; many messengers have passed before him. If he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? Those who turn back will not harm God in the least, but God will reward those who are grateful. No soul can die except by God's permission and at a predetermined time. Whoever desires the reward of this world will receive it, and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter will receive it. God will reward those who are grateful. Many prophets fought alongside godly men who did not lose heart despite facing adversity. They remained steadfast, and God loves those who are firm and patient. Their only prayer was, "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses, make our steps firm, and help us against those who disbelieve." God gave them a reward in this world and an even better reward in the Hereafter. God loves those who do good. Believers, if you obey the disbelievers, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will become losers. But God is your protector, and He is the best of helpers. We will cast terror into the hearts of the disbelievers because they associate partners with God, for which He has sent no authority. Their abode will be the Fire, and it is an evil home for the wrongdoers. God fulfilled His promise to you when you were about to annihilate your enemy with His permission, until you faltered and disputed the order, disobeying after He showed you what you desired. Among you are those who desire this world and those who desire the Hereafter. Then He diverted you...God tested you by making you retreat from your enemies, but He forgave you because He is gracious to those who believe. When you were about to defeat your enemies with God's permission, you faltered, argued, and disobeyed after seeing what you desired. Some of you wanted worldly gains, while others sought the Hereafter. God made you retreat to test you, but He has forgiven you. God is kind to believers. When you were climbing the hill, ignoring the Messenger's call from behind, God gave you distress upon distress to teach you not to grieve over what you lost or what happened to you. God knows everything you do. After the distress, God sent down calmness, making some of you feel sleepy while others were anxious and doubted God. They questioned their situation, but the matter is entirely in God's hands. They hid their thoughts, saying if they had any control, they wouldn't have been killed. Tell them that even if they stayed home, those destined to die would still go to their death. This was to test and purify your hearts. God knows what is in your hearts. Those who turned back on the day the two armies met were influenced by Satan because of their past deeds, but God has forgiven them. God is forgiving and patient. Believers, don't be like the disbelievers who say about their brothers who travel or fight, "If they had stayed with us, they wouldn't have died or been killed." God makes this a cause of regret in their hearts. God gives life and death and sees everything you do. If you die or are killed in God's way, His forgiveness and mercy are far better than anything you could amass. Whether you die or are killed, you will be gathered to God. It is by God's mercy that you deal gently with people. If you were harsh, they would have left you. So forgive them, ask for God's forgiveness for them, and consult them in important matters. Once you decide, trust in God. God loves those who trust in Him. If God helps you, no one can defeat you. If He forsakes you, who can help you? Believers should rely on God. No prophet could ever be unfaithful. Anyone who is unfaithful will bring what they misappropriated on the Day of Judgment, and everyone will be fully repaid for what they earned without injustice. Is the one who seeks God's pleasure the same as the one who incurs His wrath and ends up in Hell? They are not equal. There are different levels in God's sight, and He sees everything they do. God did a great favor to the believers by sending a messenger from among themselves, reciting God's signs, purifying them, and teaching them. God has shown great kindness to the believers by sending them a messenger from among themselves. This messenger recites God's revelations, purifies them, and teaches them the Scripture and wisdom. Before this, they were clearly in error. When a disaster struck you, even though you had inflicted twice as much damage on your enemies, you asked, "Why did this happen?" Say, "It is from yourselves. God has power over all things." What you suffered on the day the two armies met was by God's permission, to test the believers and to expose the hypocrites. These hypocrites were told, "Come, fight in God's way or at least defend yourselves." They replied, "If we knew how to fight, we would follow you." On that day, they were closer to disbelief than to faith. They said with their mouths what was not in their hearts, but God knows what they conceal. Those who stayed behind said of their brothers who were fighting, "If they had listened to us, they would not have been killed." Say, "Then avert death from yourselves if you are truthful." Do not think of those who are killed in God's way as dead. They are alive, provided for by their Lord. They rejoice in what God has given them and are happy for those who have not yet joined them, knowing they have no reason to fear or grieve. They celebrate God's grace and bounty, knowing that God does not let the reward of the believers go to waste. Those who responded to God's call and the Messenger's call, even after being wounded, will have a great reward if they do right and avoid wrong. When people told them, "A great army is gathering against you," it only increased their faith. They said, "God is sufficient for us. He is the best disposer of affairs." They returned with grace and bounty from God, unharmed, because they followed God's pleasure. God is the Lord of infinite bounty. It is only Satan who tries to make you fear his followers. Do not fear them; fear Me if you are true believers. Do not let those who rush into disbelief grieve you. They cannot harm God at all. God will not give them any portion in the Hereafter, and they will face severe punishment. Those who trade faith for disbelief will not harm God, but they will have a painful punishment. Do not think that the respite given to disbelievers is good for them. It is only to let them increase in sin, and they will have a shameful punishment. God will not leave the believers in their current state until He separates the wicked from the good. He does not reveal the secrets of the unseen to everyone, but He chooses messengers for this purpose. So believe in God and His messengers. If you believe and do right, you will have a great reward. Those who withhold the gifts God has given them should not think it is good for them. It will be worse for them. On the Day of Judgment, what they withheld will be like a twisted collar around their necks. To God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. God is fully aware of everything you do. Those who hoard the blessings God has given them should not think it is good for them. In fact, it will be worse for them. What they hoard will become a burden around their necks on the Day of Resurrection. God owns the heavens and the earth and knows all your actions. God has heard the taunts of those who say, "God is poor, and we are rich!" We will record their words and their wrongful killing of the prophets, and we will say, "Taste the penalty of the Scorching Fire!" This punishment is because of the deeds you have committed. God does not wrong His servants. They also said, "God took our promise not to believe in any messenger unless he showed us a sacrifice consumed by fire from heaven." Say, "Messengers before me came with clear signs and even with what you asked for. Why then did you kill them if you are truthful?" If they reject you, remember that messengers before you were also rejected, even though they came with clear signs, scriptures, and the Book of Enlightenment. Every soul will taste death, and on the Day of Judgment, you will be fully compensated for your deeds. Those who are saved from the Fire and admitted to Paradise have truly succeeded. The life of this world is just an illusion. You will certainly be tested in your possessions and yourselves, and you will hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if you persevere patiently and guard against evil, that will be a determining factor in all affairs. Remember, God took a covenant from the People of the Book to make His message known and clear to mankind and not to hide it. But they threw it away and traded it for a small gain. What a terrible bargain they made! Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done will escape the penalty. They will face a grievous punishment. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and He has power over all things. In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternationIn the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day, there are signs for those who understand. These are the people who remember God while standing, sitting, and lying down, and who reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth. They say, "Our Lord, You did not create this in vain. Glory to You! Save us from the penalty of the Fire." "Our Lord, anyone You admit to the Fire is covered with shame, and wrongdoers will have no helpers. Our Lord, we have heard the call to faith and we have believed. Forgive us our sins, blot out our iniquities, and take our souls in the company of the righteous." "Our Lord, grant us what You promised through Your messengers and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment. You never break Your promise." Their Lord has accepted their prayers and answered them: "I will not let the work of any of you go to waste, whether male or female. You are all equal. Those who have left their homes, been driven out, suffered harm in My cause, fought, or been slain, I will blot out their iniquities and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. This is a reward from God." God has heard their prayers and said, "I will not let the efforts of any worker, male or female, go to waste. You are all equal. Those who fled their homes, were driven out, suffered harm for My cause, fought, and were killed, I will erase their sins and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. This is a reward from God, and with God is the best of rewards." Do not be deceived by the apparent success of those who disbelieve. Their enjoyment is brief, and their ultimate abode is Hell, a terrible place to rest. On the other hand, those who fear their Lord will have Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, where they will live forever. This is a gift from God, and what God has in store is better for the righteous. Among the People of the Book, there are those who believe in God and the revelations given to you and to them. They humble themselves before God and do not trade God's signs for a small gain. Their reward is with their Lord, and God is swift in accounting. Believers, be patient, persevere, strengthen each other, and fear God so that you may succeed.

Chapter 4: AN-NISA (WOMEN)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

O mankind, be mindful of your Lord, who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate, and from them spread countless men and women. Be mindful of God, through whom you demand your mutual rights, and respect the wombs that bore you. God is always watching over you. Give orphans their property when they reach maturity. Do not substitute worthless things for their good ones, and do not consume their wealth by mixing it with your own. This is a great sin. If you fear you cannot treat orphans fairly, then marry women of your choice, two, three, or four. But if you fear you cannot be just, then marry only one or what your right hands possess. This will help you avoid injustice. Give women their dowries as a free gift, but if they willingly give up part of it, you may enjoy it with a clear conscience. Do not give your property, which God has made a means of support, to those weak of understanding. Instead, feed and clothe them from it and speak to them kindly and justly. Test orphans until they reach marriageable age. If you find them mature, hand over their property to them. Do not consume it wastefully or in haste before they grow up. If the guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him take what is just and reasonable. When you release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence. God is sufficient as a Reckoner. Men and women both have a share in what parents and close relatives leave behind, whether the property is small or large. This is a determined share. If other relatives, orphans, or the poor are present at the time of division, provide for them and speak to them kindly and justly. Let those who manage an estate have the same concern as if they had left behind a vulnerable family. They should fear God and speak words of comfort. Those who unjustly consume the property of orphans are essentially consuming fire into their bodies and will face a blazing fire. God instructs you regarding your children's inheritance: a son receives a share equal to that of two daughters. If there are only daughters, two or more, they receive two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, she gets half. Each parent receives a sixth if the deceased left children; if no children, the mother gets a third, unless there are siblings, in which case she gets a sixth. These portions are determined by God, who is all-knowing and wise. For what your wives leave, you get half if they have no children; if they have children, you get a fourth. Similarly, they get a fourth of what you leave if you have no children; if you have children, they get an eighth. If a person leaves no direct heirs but has siblings, each sibling gets a sixth; if more than two, they share a third. These are God's commands, and He is all-knowing and forbearing. Those who obey God and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, living there forever. This is the ultimate success. But those who disobey God and His Messenger and overstep His limits will be admitted to a fire, where they will remain, facing a humiliating punishment. If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four reliable witnesses against them. If they testify, confine the women to their houses until death claims them or God provides another way. If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone, for God is forgiving and merciful. God accepts the repentance of those who do wrong out of ignorance and then quickly repent. For them, God is merciful and wise. However, repentance is not accepted from those who continue to do evil until death approaches and they say, "Now I repent," nor from those who die as disbelievers. For them, a grievous punishment is prepared. Believers, you are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Do not treat them harshly to take away part of the dowry you have given them, except in cases of open lewdness. Instead, live with them kindly and justly. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike something in which God has placed much good. Treat your wives kindly, even if you dislike them, as there may be hidden good in what you dislike. Believers, you cannot inherit women against their will or treat them harshly to reclaim part of their dowry, unless they are guilty of clear indecency. If you wish to replace one wife with another, do not take back any part of the dowry you gave, even if it was a large amount. How could you take it back after you have been intimate and made a solemn promise to each other? Do not marry women whom your fathers married, as this is shameful and detestable. Forbidden to you in marriage are your mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, foster-mothers, foster-sisters, mothers-in-law, step-daughters (if you have consummated the marriage with their mothers), daughters-in-law, and having two sisters as wives at the same time. Also prohibited are married women, except those captured in war. These are God's commands. If you cannot afford to marry free believing women, you may marry believing maidens among your captives. Marry them with the permission of their owners and give them a fair dowry. They should be chaste and not promiscuous. If they commit indecency after marriage, their punishment is half that of free women. This is for those who fear sin, but it is better to practice self-restraint. God is forgiving and merciful. God wishes to make things clear to you, guide you by the examples of those before you, and turn to you in mercy. Those who follow their desires want you to deviate greatly. God wants to lighten your burdens, as humans are created weak. Believers, do not consume each other's property unjustly, but trade by mutual consent. Do not kill yourselves, for God is merciful to you. Whoever does this out of aggression and injustice will be cast into the fire. If you avoid major sins, God will forgive your minor sins and admit you to a place of honor. Do not covet what God has given to some more than others. Men and women will each be rewarded for what they earn. Ask God for His bounty. Do not envy what others have been given by God. Men and women will each be rewarded for what they earn. Ask God for His grace, as He knows everything. Everyone has been given a share of inheritance from parents and relatives. Honor agreements and give people their due, as God is a witness to all things. Men are protectors of women because God has given them more strength and they support women financially. Good women are obedient and guard what God wants them to guard. If you fear disloyalty from your wives, first advise them, then refuse to share their beds, and as a last resort, discipline them lightly. If they return to obedience, do not seek ways to harm them, as God is Most High and Great. If you fear a breach between a couple, appoint an arbiter from each family. If they seek peace, God will help them reconcile, as He knows everything. Worship God and do not associate anything with Him. Be kind to parents, relatives, orphans, the needy, neighbors, travelers, and those under your care. God does not love the arrogant and boastful. Do not be stingy or encourage others to be stingy, and do not hide the bounties God has given you. For those who resist faith, there is a shameful punishment. Those who spend their wealth to show off and do not believe in God or the Last Day are taking Satan as a companion, and he is a terrible companion. What harm would it have done them to believe in God and the Last Day and spend from what God has given them? God knows them well. God is never unjust, even in the smallest measure. If there is any good done, He will double it and give aOn the Day of Judgment, every nation will have a witness, and you, Muhammad, will be a witness against these people. Those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish they were level with the ground, but they cannot hide anything from God.

Believers, do not approach prayers while intoxicated until you understand what you are saying, nor in a state of ceremonial impurity unless you are traveling. If you are ill, on a journey, have used the restroom, or have been in contact with women and cannot find water, use clean sand or earth to cleanse yourselves. God is forgiving and merciful.

Have you seen those who were given a portion of the Book? They trade in error and wish for you to lose the right path. God knows your enemies best and is sufficient as a protector and helper. Some Jews distort words from their proper places and say, "We hear and we disobey," twisting their tongues and slandering faith. If they had said, "We hear and we obey," it would have been better for them. But God has cursed them for their disbelief, and only a few of them will believe.

People of the Book, believe in what We have revealed, confirming what you already have, before We change your faces beyond recognition or curse you as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. God's command is always executed. God does not forgive associating partners with Him, but He forgives anything else to whom He pleases. Associating partners with God is a grave sin.

Have you seen those who claim to be pure? God purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged even a little. See how they invent lies about God! That itself is a clear sin. Have you seen those who were given a portion of the Book? They believe in sorcery and evil and say to the unbelievers that they are better guided than the believers. These are the ones whom God has cursed, and you will not find any helper for them.

Do they have a share in dominion or power? If they did, they would not give people even a speck. Are they jealous of what God has given people out of His bounty? We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom. Some of them believed, and some turned away. Hell is sufficient for their burning. Those who reject Our signs will be cast into the Fire. As often as their skins are roasted, We will replace them with fresh skins so they may taste the punishment. God is Mighty and Wise.

But those who believe and do righteous deeds will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, where they will have pure companions and will dwell in cool, deep shade. God commands you to return trusts to their rightful owners and to judge with justice. How excellent is the teaching He gives you! God hears and sees all things.

Believers, obey God, His Messenger, and those in authority among you. If you disagree on anything, refer it to God and His Messenger if you believe in God and the Last Day. That is best and most suitable for final determination. Have you seen those who claim to believe in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They wish to resort to false deities for judgment, even though they were commanded to reject them. Satan wishes to lead them far astray. When it is said to them, "Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turn away in aversion.

How will it be when misfortune befalls them because of what their hands have done? Then they come to you, swearing by God, "We meant no more than goodwill and conciliation!" When misfortune strikes them because of their actions, they come to you swearing by God that they only intended good and harmony. God knows what is in their hearts, so avoid them, but advise them and speak to them in a way that reaches their souls.

We sent messengers to be obeyed according to God's will. If they had come to you when they wronged themselves and asked for God's forgiveness, and if the Messenger had also asked for their forgiveness, they would have found God to be forgiving and merciful. But no, by your Lord, they will not truly believe until they accept your judgment in their disputes and find no resistance in their hearts to your decisions, fully submitting to them. If We had commanded them to sacrifice their lives or leave their homes, only a few would have done it. But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and strengthened their faith. We would have given them a great reward and guided them to the straight path.

Those who obey God and the Messenger will be with those whom God has blessed: the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. What a beautiful fellowship! This is a bounty from God, and God is all-knowing.

Believers, take your precautions and either go forth in groups or all together. Among you, there are those who hesitate. If a misfortune befalls you, they say, "God favored us by not being present with them." But if good fortune comes to you from God, they say, "Oh, I wish I had been with them; I would have achieved great success!" Let those who sell the life of this world for the hereafter fight in the cause of God. Whether they are slain or victorious, We will give them a great reward.

Why should you not fight in the cause of God and for the oppressed men, women, and children who cry out, "Our Lord, rescue us from this town of oppressors and send us a protector and helper!" Those who believe fight in the cause of God, while those who disbelieve fight in the cause of evil. So fight against the allies of Satan, for Satan's strategy is weak.

Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands from fighting, establish regular prayers, and give charity? But when fighting was prescribed for them, a group of them feared people as they should have feared God, or even more. They said, "Our Lord, why have you ordained fighting for us? Could you not delay it for a while?" Say, "The enjoyment of this world is brief; the hereafter is better for those who do right, and you will not be wronged even a little." Wherever you are, death will find you, even if you are in fortified towers. If good befalls them, they say, "This is from God." But if evil befalls them, they say, "This is from you, O Prophet." Say, "All things are from God." What is wrong with these people that they fail to understand a single fact?

No matter where you are, death will find you, even if you are in fortified towers. When good things happen, they say, "This is from God." But when bad things happen, they blame you, Prophet. Tell them, "Everything is from God." Why don't these people understand this simple truth? Whatever good happens to you is from God, but whatever bad happens is because of your own actions. We have sent you, Prophet, as a messenger to guide humanity, and God is enough as a witness. Whoever obeys the Messenger obeys God. If anyone turns away, remember, we haven't sent you to watch over their deeds. They say they will obey, but when they leave you, some of them plan things that are different from what you said. God knows what they plan at night. So, avoid them and trust in God. God is enough as a protector.

Don't they reflect on the Quran? If it were from anyone other than God, they would have found many contradictions in it. When they hear news about safety or fear, they spread it without thinking. If they had referred it to the Messenger or those in authority, the truth would have been clear. If it weren't for God's grace and mercy, most of you would have followed Satan. So, fight in God's cause. You are responsible only for yourself. Encourage the believers to fight. Maybe God will restrain the disbelievers' power. God is the strongest in might and punishment. Whoever supports a good cause will share in its reward, and whoever supports an evil cause will share in its burden. God has power over everything.

When you are greeted, respond with a better greeting or at least an equal one. God keeps account of everything. God is the only God. He will gather you all on the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. Who is more truthful than God?

Why are you divided into two groups about the hypocrites? God has cast them back because of their deeds. Do you want to guide those whom God has led astray? You can't find a way for those whom God has led astray. They wish you would disbelieve as they do so you would be the same as them. Don't take them as friends until they leave their homes for God's cause. If they turn back to enmity, seize them and kill them wherever you find them. Don't take them as friends or helpers. Except those who seek refuge with people you have a treaty with, or those who come to you with hearts restraining them from fighting you or their own people. If God had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. If they withdraw and offer you peace, God allows you no way against them.

You will find others who want security from you and their own people. Whenever they are tempted, they fall into it. If they don't withdraw from you or offer you peace, seize them and kill them wherever you find them. In this case, We have given you a clear argument against them. If they don't keep away from you, offer peace, or hold back their hands, then capture and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you clear authority against such people.A believer should never kill another believer, except by mistake. If someone kills a believer by mistake, they must free a believing slave and pay compensation to the deceased's family, unless the family forgives it. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you and was a believer, freeing a believing slave is enough. If the deceased belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, compensation should be paid to the family and a believing slave should be freed. If someone cannot afford this, they must fast for two consecutive months as repentance to God. God is all-knowing and wise. If someone intentionally kills a believer, their punishment is Hell, where they will stay forever. God's wrath and curse are upon them, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for them.

Believers, when you go out in the cause of God, investigate carefully and do not say to anyone who offers you peace, "You are not a believer," seeking the temporary goods of this life. With God, there are abundant gains. You were like this before, but God has been gracious to you. So, investigate carefully. God is well aware of all that you do.

Not equal are those believers who sit at home and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God has granted a higher grade to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home. God has promised good to all believers, but He has given a special reward to those who strive and fight. These ranks, forgiveness, and mercy are specially bestowed by Him. God is oft-forgiving, most merciful.

When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against themselves, they ask, "What was your condition?" They reply, "We were weak and oppressed in the land." The angels say, "Wasn't God's earth spacious enough for you to migrate?" Such people will find their abode in Hell, an evil refuge. Except for those who are truly weak and oppressed—men, women, and children—who have no means or guide to their way. For these, there is hope that God will forgive them. God is forgiving and merciful.

Whoever leaves their home in the cause of God will find many places of refuge and abundance on earth. If they die as a refugee for God and His Messenger, their reward is due with God. God is oft-forgiving, most merciful.

When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, fearing that unbelievers may attack you. The unbelievers are your open enemies. When you, O Messenger, are with them and lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up in prayer with you, taking their arms with them. When they finish their prostrations, let them take their position in the rear. Let the other party come up, which has not yet prayed, and let them pray with you, taking all precautions and bearing arms. The unbelievers wish that you would be negligent of your arms and baggage so they could assault you in a single rush. There is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take every precaution for yourselves. God has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers.

When you finish the prayer, remember God while standing, sitting, or lying down. Once you are safe, establish regular prayers, as they are prescribed for believers at specific times. Do not hesitate to pursue the enemy. If you are suffering, they are suffering too, but you have hope from God, which they do not. God is all-knowing and wise.

We have revealed the Book to you in truth so you can judge between people as guided by God. Do not advocate for those who betray their trust. Seek God's forgiveness, for He is forgiving and merciful. Do not defend those who deceive themselves. God does not love the treacherous and sinful. They may hide their crimes from people, but they cannot hide from God, who is with them when they plot at night. God encompasses all they do. You may defend them in this world, but who will defend them before God on the Day of Judgment?

If anyone does wrong and then seeks God's forgiveness, they will find God forgiving and merciful. Whoever commits a sin does so against their own soul. God is all-knowing and wise. If someone commits a fault or sin and blames an innocent person, they carry a burden of falsehood and a flagrant sin. If it were not for God's grace and mercy, a group of them would have misled you, but they only mislead themselves and cannot harm you. God has revealed the Book and wisdom to you and taught you what you did not know. His grace upon you is immense.

Most of their secret talks are not beneficial, except for those who encourage charity, goodness, or reconciliation. Whoever does this seeking God's pleasure will receive a great reward. If anyone opposes the Messenger after guidance has been made clear and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will leave them on their chosen path and lead them to Hell, a terrible destination.

God does not forgive associating others with Him, but He forgives other sins for whom He wills. Whoever associates others with God has strayed far. They call upon female deities and Satan, the persistent rebel. God cursed him, and he said, "I will take a portion of Your servants and mislead them, arouse desires in them, command them to slit the ears of cattle, and alter God's creation." Whoever takes Satan as a friend instead of God is a clear loser.

Satan promises them and stirs up false desires, but his promises are nothing but deception. Those who follow him will end up in Hell, with no escape. However, those who believe and do good deeds will be admitted to gardens with rivers flowing beneath, where they will live forever. This is God's true promise, and no one is more truthful than Him.

Your desires or those of the People of the Book won't prevail. Whoever does evil will be repaid accordingly and will find no protector or helper besides God. But those who do good deeds, whether male or female, and have faith, will enter Heaven and will not be wronged in the least. Who can be better in religion than one who submits to God, does good, and follows the way of Abraham, whom God took as a friend? Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God, and He encompasses all things.

They ask for guidance concerning women. Say: God instructs you about them, especially regarding female orphans to whom you do not give the prescribed portions and whom you desire to marry, and concerning weak children. Stand firm for justice to orphans. God is aware of all the good you do.

If a wife fears cruelty or desertion from her husband, there is no blame if they arrange an amicable settlement. Such a settlement is best, even though men's souls are swayed by greed. But if you do good and practice self-restraint, God is well-acquainted with all that you do. You will never be able to be completely fair between your wives, even if you desire it. But do not turn away from one altogether, leaving her in suspense. If you come to a friendly understanding and practice self-restraint, God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. If they must part, God will provide abundance for all from His bounty. God cares for all and is Wise.

Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God. We have directed the People of the Book before you, and you, to fear God. If you deny Him, everything still belongs to God, and He is free of all wants, worthy of all praise. If He wills, He can destroy you and create another race, for He has the power to do so. Whoever desires a reward in this life should know that God has the reward of both this life and the hereafter. God hears and sees all things.

O believers, stand firmly for justice as witnesses to God, even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or your kin, whether rich or poor. God can best protect both. Do not follow your desires, lest you swerve from justice. If you distort or decline to do justice, God is well-acquainted with all that you do. If you falter or stray, know that God is always aware of your actions.

Believers, uphold justice and bear witness for God, even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Whether the person is rich or poor, God is closer to them in compassion. Do not follow your desires, as they may lead you away from justice. If you deviate or turn aside, God is fully aware of what you do.

Believers, have faith in God, His Messenger, and the scriptures He has sent down to His Messenger and those before him. Anyone who denies God, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Day of Judgment has gone far astray. Those who believe, then reject faith, then believe again and again reject faith, and continue to increase in disbelief, God will not forgive them nor guide them on the right path. Warn the hypocrites of a severe penalty. They seek honor from disbelievers rather than believers, but all honor belongs to God.

When you hear God's signs being denied and ridiculed, do not sit with those who do so until they change the subject. Otherwise, you would be like them. God will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers together in Hell. These hypocrites wait and watch you. If you gain a victory from God, they say, "Were we not with you?" But if the disbelievers succeed, they say, "Did we not gain an advantage over you and protect you from the believers?" God will judge between you on the Day of Judgment, and He will not grant the disbelievers a way to triumph over the believers.

The hypocrites think they can deceive God, but He will outsmart them. When they stand up for prayer, they do so lazily, only to be seen by people, and they remember God but little. They waver between belief and disbelief, belonging neither to one group nor the other.Believers, do not take disbelievers as friends instead of believers. Do you wish to offer God a clear proof against yourselves? The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire, and you will find no helper for them, except those who repent, mend their ways, hold fast to God, and purify their religion for God. They will be with the believers, and God will grant the believers a great reward. What does God gain by punishing you if you are grateful and believe? God is always responsive and aware. He does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech unless it is by someone who has been wronged. God hears and knows all things. If you do good openly or secretly, or forgive an evil, God is forgiving and powerful. Those who deny God and His messengers and seek to make a distinction between God and His messengers, saying, "We believe in some but reject others," and wish to take a middle course, are truly disbelievers. We have prepared a humiliating punishment for them. But those who believe in God and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them, God will give them their due rewards. God is forgiving and merciful.

The People of the Book ask you to bring down a book from heaven. They asked Moses for an even greater miracle, saying, "Show us God in public." They were struck by thunder and lightning for their arrogance. Despite clear signs, they worshipped the calf, but We forgave them and gave Moses clear authority. We raised Mount Sinai over them as a sign of their covenant and told them to enter the gate humbly and not to break the Sabbath. We made a firm covenant with them. They incurred divine displeasure by breaking their covenant, rejecting God's signs, killing the prophets unjustly, and claiming their hearts were sealed. God sealed their hearts for their disbelief, so only a few believe. They disbelieved and slandered Mary with a grave false charge. They boasted, "We killed Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of God," but they neither killed nor crucified him. It only appeared so to them. Those who differ are full of doubts, following conjecture. They certainly did not kill him. Instead, God raised him up to Himself. God is Exalted in Power and Wise. Everyone among the People of the Book will believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Judgment, he will be a witness against them.

For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made certain good and wholesome foods unlawful for them because they hindered many from God's way. They took usury, though forbidden, and wrongfully consumed people's wealth. We have prepared a grievous punishment for those who reject faith. But those well-grounded in knowledge and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you. Those who establish regular prayer, practice charity, and believe in God and the Last Day will receive a great reward. We sent you inspiration as We sent it to Noah and the messengers after him. We sent inspiration to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Tribes, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, Solomon, and to David, We gave the Psalms. We have told you the stories of some messengers and not others. God spoke directly to Moses. These messengers brought good news and warnings so that people would have no argument against God after the messengers. God is Exalted in Power and Wise. God bears witness to what He has revealed to you from His knowledge, and the angels also bear witness. God is sufficient as a witness. Those who reject faith and hinder others from God's way have strayed far from the path. God will not forgive or guide those who disbelieve and act unjustly, except to the path of Hell, where they will dwell forever. This is easy for God.

O mankind! The Messenger has come to you with the truth from God. Believe in him; it is better for you. But if you reject faith, know that everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God, who is All-Knowing and Wise. O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your religion and speak only the truth about God. Jesus, the son of Mary, was just a messenger of God, His word given to Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers. Do not say "Trinity"; stop, it is better for you. God is one and far above having a son. Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him, and He is sufficient as a protector. The Messiah does not disdain being a servant of God, nor do the angels close to Him. Those who disdain His worship and are arrogant will be gathered to Him for judgment. Those who believe and do good deeds will receive their rewards and more from His bounty. But those who are arrogant and disdainful will face a severe punishment and will find no protector or helper besides God.

O mankind! A clear proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light. Those who believe in God and hold fast to Him will be admitted to His mercy and grace and guided to a straight path. They ask you for a legal decision. Say: God directs you about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If a man dies leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance. If a woman dies leaving no child, her brother takes her inheritance. If there are two sisters, they share two-thirds of the inheritance. If there are brothers and sisters, the male gets twice the share of the female. God makes His laws clear to you so you do not err. God knows all things.

Chapter 5: AL-MAEDA (THE TABLE SPREAD)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

O you who believe! Fulfill all obligations. Lawful for you are all four-footed animals, except those named. Animals of the chase are forbidden while you are in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. God commands according to His will and plan. O you who believe! Do not violate the sanctity of God's symbols, the sacred month, the animals brought for sacrifice, the garlands marking such animals, or the people going to the sacred house seeking their Lord's bounty and pleasure. When you are clear of the sacred precincts, you may hunt. Do not let hatred of people who once stopped you from the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression. Help each other in righteousness and piety, but do not help each other in sin and aggression. Fear God, for He is strict in punishment.

Forbidden to you for food are dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which the name of other than God has been invoked; that which has been killed by strangling, a violent blow, a headlong fall, or being gored to death; that which has been partly eaten by a wild animal unless you are able to slaughter it properly; that which is sacrificed on stone altars; and the division of meat by raffling with arrows. This is impiety. Today, those who reject faith have given up all hope of your religion, so do not fear them but fear Me. Today, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and chosen Islam as your religion. But if anyone is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, God is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Forbidden to you are animals that die on their own, blood, pork, and anything dedicated to other than God. Also forbidden are animals strangled, beaten to death, fallen from a height, gored, or partially eaten by wild animals unless you properly slaughter them. Sacrifices made on stone altars and dividing meat by drawing lots are also prohibited. These are sinful acts. Today, those who disbelieve have lost hope in harming your religion, so do not fear them, but fear Me. Today, I have perfected your religion, completed My favor upon you, and chosen Islam for you. If someone is forced by hunger, without intent to sin, God is Forgiving and Merciful.

They ask you what is lawful for them to eat. Say: All good and pure things are lawful for you. Also lawful are the animals caught by your trained hunting animals, as long as you mention God's name over them. Fear God, for He is swift in taking account. Today, all good and pure things are made lawful for you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. Lawful for you in marriage are chaste women who are believers and chaste women from the People of the Book, provided you give them their due dowers and seek chastity, not lewdness or secret affairs. If anyone rejects faith, their work is in vain, and in the Hereafter, they will be among the losers.

O you who believe! When you prepare for prayer, wash your faces and hands up to the elbows, rub your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. If you are ill, on a journey, or have come from the toilet, or have had contact with women and cannot find water, then use clean sand or earth and rub your faces and hands with it. God does not wish to place you in difficulty but to make you clean and complete His favor upon you so that you may be grateful. Remember God's favor upon you and His covenant when you said, "We hear and we obey." Fear God, for He knows well the secrets of your hearts.

O you who believe! Stand firmly for God as witnesses to fair dealing, and do not let hatred of others lead you to injustice. Be just, for that is closer to piety. Fear God, for He is well-acquainted with all that you do. God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those who believe and do righteous deeds. But those who reject faith and deny Our signs will be companions of Hellfire. O you who believe! Remember God's favor when certain people intended to harm you, but He held back their hands. Fear God and put your trust in Him. God took a covenant from the Children of Israel and appointed twelve leaders among them. God said, "I am with you if you establish regular prayers, give charity, believe in My messengers, honor and assist them, and..."Give to God a good loan, and He will erase your sins and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath. But if any of you turn away from faith after this, they have truly strayed from the right path. Because they broke their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts hard. They distort words from their proper places and forget a significant part of the message sent to them. You will always find them deceitful, except for a few. But forgive them and overlook their misdeeds, for God loves those who are kind. We also made a covenant with those who call themselves Christians, but they forgot a part of the message sent to them. As a result, We stirred up enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Judgment. God will soon show them what they have done.

O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, revealing much of what you used to hide in the Book and overlooking much. A new light and a clear Book have come to you from God. With this Book, God guides those who seek His pleasure to paths of peace and safety, bringing them out of darkness into light and guiding them to a straight path. Those who say that God is Christ, the son of Mary, are indeed blasphemous. Say: Who can do anything against God if He wills to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, his mother, and everyone on earth? To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between. He creates what He pleases, and He has power over all things. The Jews and Christians say: "We are the sons of God and His beloved." Say: Why then does He punish you for your sins? No, you are just humans among those He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between, and to Him is the final return.

O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making things clear after a break in the series of messengers, so you cannot say: "No bringer of glad tidings and no warner came to us." Now a bringer of glad tidings and a warner has come to you. God has power over all things. Remember when Moses said to his people: "O my people! Remember God's favor upon you when He raised prophets among you, made you kings, and gave you what He had not given to any other people." "O my people! Enter the holy land which God has assigned to you, and do not turn back in fear, or you will be overthrown and ruined." They said: "O Moses! In this land are people of great strength. We will never enter it until they leave. If they leave, then we will enter." Two men who feared God and were blessed by Him said: "Attack them through the gate. When you enter, victory will be yours. Put your trust in God if you are believers." They said: "O Moses! We will never enter as long as they are there. Go, you and your Lord, and fight. We will sit here." Moses said: "O my Lord! I have control only over myself and my brother. Separate us from these rebellious people." God said: "The land will be forbidden to them for forty years. They will wander in the land in distraction. Do not grieve over these rebellious people."

So, it shall be forbidden to them for forty years, and they will wander in the land. Do not grieve for the nation of transgressors. Recite to them the true story of the two sons of Adam. Each presented a sacrifice to God: it was accepted from one but not from the other. The latter said, "I will surely kill you." The former replied, "God accepts sacrifices only from the righteous." He continued, "Even if you stretch your hand to kill me, I will not stretch my hand to kill you. I fear God, the Lord of the worlds. I intend to let you bear my sin and your own, for you will be among the companions of the fire. That is the reward for those who do wrong." The selfish soul of the other led him to murder his brother, and he became one of the lost ones. Then God sent a raven to scratch the ground and show him how to hide his brother's body. He said, "Woe is me! Was I not even able to be like this raven and hide my brother's body?" He became full of regret.

Because of this, We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone kills a person—unless it is for murder or spreading mischief in the land—it is as if they killed all of humanity. And if anyone saves a life, it is as if they saved all of humanity. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, but many of them continued to commit excesses in the land. The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Messenger and strive to spread mischief in the land is execution, crucifixion, cutting off hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile. This is their disgrace in this world, and they will have a heavy punishment in the Hereafter, except for those who repent before you overpower them. Know that God is Forgiving, Merciful.

O believers! Be mindful of your duty to God, seek ways to approach Him, and strive in His cause so that you may prosper. As for those who reject faith, even if they had everything on earth and twice as much to ransom themselves from the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it would not be accepted. They will have a grievous penalty. They will wish to escape the Fire, but they will not be able to. Their penalty will endure. As for the thief, male or female, cut off their hands as a punishment for their crime, an exemplary punishment from God. God is Exalted in power. But if the thief repents after their crime and amends their conduct, God will forgive them. God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Do you not know that to God alone belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He pleases and forgives whom He pleases. God has power over all things. O Messenger! Do not let those who race each other into unbelief grieve you, whether they say "We believe" with their lips but have no faith in their hearts, or it be among the Jews—people who listen to any lie and change words from their proper places. They say, "If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware!" If God intends a trial for anyone, you have no authority against God for them. For such people, there is disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment in the Hereafter.

O Messenger, don't let those who rush into disbelief upset you, whether they say "We believe" with their mouths but have no faith in their hearts, or whether they are among the Jews who listen to lies and distort words from their proper places. They say, "If you are given this, accept it, but if not, beware!" If God intends to test someone, you cannot protect them from God. These are the ones whose hearts God does not wish to purify. They will face disgrace in this world and severe punishment in the Hereafter. They love to listen to falsehood and consume what is forbidden. If they come to you for judgment, you can either judge between them or decline. If you decline, they cannot harm you. But if you judge, do so with fairness, for God loves those who are just. Why do they come to you for judgment when they have the Torah, which contains God's judgment? Yet they turn away from it. These are not true believers.

We revealed the Torah, which contains guidance and light. The prophets who submitted to God judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars who were entrusted with God's Book. Do not fear people, but fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a small price. Those who do not judge by what God has revealed are disbelievers. We ordained for them in the Torah: life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and equal retaliation for wounds. But if anyone forgives out of charity, it will be an atonement for them. Those who do not judge by what God has revealed are wrongdoers.

We sent Jesus, son of Mary, following in the footsteps of the prophets, confirming the Torah that came before him. We gave him the Gospel, which contains guidance and light, confirming the Torah and serving as a guidance and admonition for those who fear God. Let the people of the Gospel judge by what God has revealed in it. Those who do not judge by what God has revealed are rebels. We sent down the Scripture to you, confirming the previous scriptures and guarding them. So judge between them by what God has revealed and do not follow their desires, diverging from the truth that has come to you. Each of you has been given a law and a way. If God had willed, He could have made you one community, but He tests you through what He has given you. So compete in doing good deeds. To God, you will all return, and He will inform you about the matters in which you differed.

Judge between them by what God has revealed and do not follow their desires. Be cautious of them, lest they lead you astray from some of what God has revealed to you. If they turn away, know that God intends to punish them for some of their sins. Many people are rebellious. Do they seek the judgment of the days of ignorance? Who is better than God in judgment for a people who are certain in their faith?

O believers, do not take Jews and Christians as friends and protectors. They are friends and protectors to each other. Whoever among you takes them as friends is one of them. God does not guide unjust people. You see those with a disease in their hearts rushing to them, saying, "We fear a change of fortune might harm us." But perhaps God will grant you victory or a decision from Him, and then they will regret their secret thoughts. Believers will say, "Are these the ones who swore their strongest oaths by God that they were with you?" Their deeds have failed, and they are the losers.

O believers, if any of you turn back from your faith, God will bring forth people whom He loves and who love Him, humble towards believers, stern towards disbelievers, striving in the way of God, and not fearing the blame of anyone. This is the grace of God, which He bestows on whom He wills. God is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing."Believers, do not take as friends those who mock your religion, whether they are from the People of the Book or disbelievers. Fear God if you are true believers. When you call to prayer, they take it as a joke because they do not understand. Say, "O People of the Book, do you blame us for no other reason than that we believe in God and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before, and because most of you are rebellious?" Say, "Shall I tell you of a worse case than yours for retribution with God? Those whom God has cursed, upon whom His wrath has fallen, and whom He turned into apes and swine, and who worshipped evil. They are worse in rank and further astray from the right path." When they come to you, they say, "We believe," but they enter with disbelief and leave with it. God knows best what they hide. You see many of them racing each other in sin and hostility, and consuming what is forbidden. Evil indeed are the things they do. Why do the rabbis and scholars not forbid them from uttering sinful words and consuming forbidden things? Evil indeed are their works. The Jews say, "God's hand is tied up." Their hands are tied up, and they are cursed for what they say. No, both His hands are widely outstretched; He gives and spends as He pleases. What has been revealed to you from your Lord increases many of them in rebellion and disbelief. We have placed enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, God extinguishes it. They strive to do mischief on earth, and God does not love those who do mischief. If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We would have blotted out their sins and admitted them to gardens of bliss. If the People of the Book had truly believed and followed the teachings of the Torah and the Gospel, they would have been blessed with abundance from above and below. Among them, there are some who are on the right path, but many follow a path of evil. O Messenger, deliver the message revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not, you have not fulfilled your mission. God will protect you from those who wish to harm you. God does not guide those who reject faith. Say, "O People of the Book, you have no true guidance unless you uphold the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord." The revelation from your Lord increases many of them in rebellion and disbelief. Do not grieve for those who disbelieve. Those who believe in the Qur'an, the Jews, the Sabians, and the Christians—anyone who believes in God and the Last Day and does good deeds—will have no fear and will not grieve. We made a covenant with the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Whenever a messenger came with what they did not desire, they called some impostors and killed others. They thought there would be no punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Yet God turned to them in mercy, but many of them remained blind and deaf. God sees all that they do. Those who say, "God is Christ, the son of Mary," disbelieve. Christ himself said, "O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord." Whoever associates others with God, God will forbid them from Paradise, and their abode will be the Fire. There will be no helpers for the wrongdoers. Those who say, "God is one of three in a Trinity," disbelieve. There is no god but One God. If they do not stop saying this, a painful punishment will befall them. Will they not turn to God and seek His forgiveness? God is Forgiving and Merciful. Christ, the son of Mary, was only a messenger; many messengers passed away before him. His mother was a truthful woman. They both ate food. See how clear We make the signs for them, yet see how they are deluded away from the truth. Say, "Do you worship besides God something that has no power to harm or benefit you? God is the Hearer, the Knower." Say, "O People of the Book, do not exceed the bounds of truth in your religion, nor follow the desires of those who went astray before and led many others astray." Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongues of David and Jesus, the son of Mary, because they disobeyed and transgressed. They did not forbid one another from the wrongs they committed. Evil indeed were their deeds. You see many of them turning in friendship to the disbelievers. Evil indeed are the deeds they have sent ahead for themselves, resulting in God's wrath and eternal torment. If only they had believed in God, in the Prophet, and in what has been revealed to him, they would never have taken disbelievers as friends and protectors. But most of them are rebellious wrongdoers. You will find the most hostile people towards the believers to be the Jews and the pagans. And you will find the nearest in affection to the believers to be those who say, "We are Christians." This is because among them are priests and monks, and they are not arrogant. When they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the truth. They pray, "Our Lord! We believe; write us down among the witnesses." What reason do we have not to believe in God and the truth that has come to us, while we earnestly desire that our Lord should cause us to enter with the righteous? God has rewarded them for their prayer with gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will abide forever. This is the reward for those who do good. But those who reject faith and deny Our signs will be companions of the Hellfire. O you who believe! Do not make unlawful the good things which God has made lawful for you, but do not commit excess. God does not love those who exceed the limits. Eat of the lawful and good things that God has provided for you, and be mindful of your duty to God, in whom you believe. God will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths, but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths. For expiation, feed ten needy people with the average food of your families, or clothe them, or free a slave. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. This is the expiation for your oaths when you have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus does God make clear to you His signs, that you may be grateful. O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, dedication of stones, and divination by arrows are abominations of Satan's handiwork. Avoid them so that you may prosper. Satan's plan is to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to hinder you from the remembrance of God and from prayer. Will you not then abstain? Obey God and obey the Messenger, and beware of evil. If you turn back, know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the message clearly."Convey the message clearly. There is no blame on those who believe and do good deeds for what they ate in the past, as long as they guard themselves from evil, believe, and do good deeds. God loves those who do good. O believers, God will test you with some game that is within reach of your hands and lances, so that He may know who fears Him unseen. Whoever transgresses after this will have a painful punishment. O believers, do not kill game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. If any of you does so intentionally, the compensation is an offering brought to the Ka'ba of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, as judged by two just men among you, or by feeding the needy, or its equivalent in fasting. This is to make him taste the penalty of his deed. God forgives what is past, but for repetition, God will exact from him.

O believers, do not hunt while you are on pilgrimage. If anyone does so intentionally, they must compensate by offering a domestic animal equivalent to what they killed, as judged by two just men among you, or by feeding the poor, or fasting. This is to make them experience the consequences of their actions. God forgives past actions, but if someone repeats the offense, God will take retribution. God is Mighty and capable of retribution. Hunting and eating sea game is allowed for you, as a provision for you and travelers, but hunting land game is forbidden while you are on pilgrimage. Be mindful of God, to whom you will be gathered.

God has made the Ka'ba, the Sacred House, a place of security for people, as well as the sacred months, the offerings, and the garlands marking them. This is so you may know that God knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and that God is all-knowing. Know that God is strict in punishment but also forgiving and merciful. The Messenger's duty is only to convey the message. God knows what you reveal and what you conceal. Say: "The bad and the good are not equal, even if the abundance of the bad may dazzle you. So be mindful of your duty to God, O people of understanding, so you may succeed."

O believers, do not ask about things which, if made clear to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask about them when the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made clear to you. God has forgiven this, for God is forgiving and forbearing. Some people before you asked such questions and then lost their faith because of it. God did not institute superstitions like the slit-ear she-camel, or the she-camel let loose for free pasture, or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals, or stallion-camels freed from work. It is the disbelievers who invent lies against God, but most of them lack wisdom. When it is said to them, "Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger," they say, "What we found our fathers following is enough for us." Even though their fathers had no knowledge or guidance?

O believers, take care of your own souls. If you follow the right guidance, those who go astray cannot harm you. To God is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. O believers, when death approaches any of you, take witnesses among yourselves when making bequests—two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling and death befalls you. If you doubt their truth, detain them after prayer and let them swear by God: "We wish not in this for any worldly gain, even if the beneficiary is a near relation. We shall not hide the evidence before God; if we do, then the sin be upon us." But if it is later found that these two were guilty of perjury, let two others stand in their place, nearest in kin from those who claim a lawful right. Let them swear by God: "Our testimony is truer than theirs, and we have not trespassed beyond the truth. If we did, the wrong would be upon us." This is most suitable so they may give true evidence, or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after theirs.

Be mindful of God and listen to His guidance, for God does not guide rebellious people. This approach encourages truthful testimony and deters false oaths. On the Day of Judgment, God will gather the messengers and ask about the response they received from people. They will reply that only God knows the hidden things. God will remind Jesus, son of Mary, of His favors: how He strengthened him with the Holy Spirit, enabling him to speak to people in childhood and maturity, taught him the Scriptures, and allowed him to perform miracles by His permission. Jesus healed the blind and the lepers, raised the dead, and was protected from harm by the Children of Israel, who accused him of magic. God inspired the disciples to believe in Him and His messenger, and they declared their faith. The disciples asked Jesus if God could send down a table of food from heaven. Jesus advised them to fear God if they truly believed. They wanted to eat from it to satisfy their hearts and confirm the truth of Jesus' message. Jesus prayed to God to send down a table of food as a sign and a source of sustenance. God agreed but warned that those who disbelieve afterward would face severe punishment.

On the Day of Judgment, God will ask Jesus if he told people to worship him and his mother as gods. Jesus will deny it, affirming that he only conveyed God's command to worship Him alone. Jesus will say he was a witness over the people while he was among them, but after God took him, He was the Watcher over them. Jesus will acknowledge that if God punishes them, they are His servants, and if He forgives them, He is the Mighty, the Wise. God will declare that the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness on that day, receiving eternal gardens with rivers flowing beneath. God will be pleased with them, and they with Him, which is the ultimate success. God has dominion over the heavens and the earth and has power over all things.

Praise be to God, the Most Merciful, who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light. Yet, some people still reject faith and equate others with their Guardian-Lord. God created you from clay and set a fixed term for you, yet you doubt His presence. He knows everything you hide and reveal, and what you earn by your deeds. Despite receiving signs from their Lord, people turn away and reject the truth. They will soon realize the reality of what they mocked. Many generations before were destroyed for their sins, even though they were more established on earth and received abundant rain and flowing rivers. If God had sent a written message on parchment, the unbelievers would still call it magic. They demand an angel, but if an angel were sent, the matter would be settled instantly, leaving no time for reflection. If God had sent an angel, it would have been in human form, causing more confusion. Messengers before Muhammad were mocked, but the mockers were eventually surrounded by what they mocked. God commands to travel the earth and see the fate of those who rejected the truth.

Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to God, who has inscribed mercy for Himself and will gather everyone on the Day of Judgment. Those who ruin their souls will not believe. God knows everything that dwells in the night and day. He is the one who hears and knows all things. Should anyone take a protector other than God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who feeds but is not fed? Muhammad is commanded to be the first to submit to God and not join others with Him. Disobeying God brings fear of a mighty penalty on the Day of Judgment. If God's mercy averts the penalty, it is a clear triumph. If God touches you with affliction, only He can remove it. If He grants you happiness, no one can impair it. He is the Omnipotent, the Wise, and the Knower. God is the most weighty in evidence, and the Qur'an was revealed to warn everyone. There is no other god besides God, and Muhammad is innocent of associating others with Him.

Those who received the Book know this truth as they know their own sons. Those who received the Scripture recognize this revelation as they recognize their own children. However, those who have lost their souls refuse to believe. Who does more wrong than someone who invents lies about God or rejects His signs? Wrongdoers will never succeed. On the Day of Judgment, God will gather everyone and ask those who associated partners with Him, "Where are the partners you talked about?" They will have no excuse but to say, "By God, our Lord, we were not idolaters." See how they lie against themselves, and the falsehoods they invented will abandon them.

Some people pretend to listen, but their hearts are veiled, and their ears are deaf. Even if they saw every sign, they would not believe. When they come to argue, they say, "These are just tales of the ancients." They keep others away from the truth and avoid it themselves, destroying their own souls without realizing it. If you could see them when they are confronted with the Fire, they will say, "If only we could be sent back, we would not reject the signs of our Lord and would be among the believers!" But even if they were sent back, they would return to their forbidden ways because they are liars. They say, "There is nothing but our life on this earth, and we will not be raised again." If you could see them when they are confronted with their Lord, He will ask, "Is this not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord!" He will then say, "Taste the penalty for your disbelief."

Those who deny meeting God are truly lost. When the Hour comes upon them suddenly, they will cry, "Alas for us, we neglected it!" They will bear their burdens on their backs, and what a terrible burden it is. The life of this world is just play and amusement, but the home in the hereafter is better for the righteous. Will you not understand? We know the grief their words cause you.""They do not reject you, but they reject the signs of God. Messengers before you were also rejected, but they patiently endured until Our help reached them. No one can change the words of God. You have already received some accounts of those messengers. If their rejection is hard on you, seek a way to bring them a sign, but know that if God willed, He could have guided them all. Do not be among the ignorant. Only those who listen will accept the truth. As for the dead, God will raise them up, and they will return to Him. They ask, 'Why hasn't a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'God has the power to send down a sign, but most of them do not understand.' There is not an animal on earth or a bird that flies with its wings that does not form communities like you. Nothing is omitted from the Book, and they will all be gathered to their Lord in the end.

Those who reject our signs are like the deaf and dumb, lost in deep darkness. God leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills to the right path. Say: 'If God's punishment or the Hour comes upon you, would you call upon anyone other than God? Answer if you are truthful!' No, you would call upon Him, and if He wills, He would remove your distress, and you would forget the partners you associated with Him. Before you, We sent messengers to many nations, and We afflicted them with suffering and adversity so they might learn humility. But when suffering came from Us, they did not humble themselves; instead, their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their sinful acts seem attractive to them. When they forgot the warnings they had received, We opened the gates of all good things for them. But while they were rejoicing, We suddenly called them to account, and they were plunged into despair. The wrongdoers were cut off, and all praise is due to God, the Lord of the worlds.

Say: 'If God took away your hearing, sight, and sealed your hearts, who could restore them but God?' See how We explain the signs, yet they turn away. Say: 'If God's punishment comes to you suddenly or openly, will anyone be destroyed except the wrongdoers?' We send messengers only to give good news and to warn. Those who believe and do right will have no fear or grief. But those who reject Our signs will face punishment for their disobedience. Say: 'I do not claim to possess God's treasures, know the unseen, or be an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.' Are the blind and the seeing equal? Will you not reflect? Warn those who fear being gathered before their Lord, who have no protector or intercessor besides Him, so they may guard against evil. Do not turn away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His favor. You are not accountable for them, nor are they accountable for you. If you turn them away, you would be unjust. We test some people by comparing them with others, so they may say, 'Are these the ones God has favored among us?' Does God not know best who is grateful?

When those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: 'Peace be upon you. Your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself. If any of you does evil in ignorance and then repents and does right, He is Forgiving, Merciful.' Thus, We explain the signs in detail so the way of the sinners may be clear. Say: 'I am forbidden to worship those you call upon besides God. I will not follow your desires, for if I did, I would go astray and not be guided.' Say: 'I rely on clear proof from my Lord, but you reject Him. What you want to be hastened is not in my power. The decision rests with God alone. He declares the truth, and He is the best judge.' Say: 'If what you want to be hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled between us. But God knows best who does wrong.'

With Him are the keys to the unseen, treasures that only He knows. He knows everything on earth and in the sea. Not a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry, but it is all recorded in a clear book. He is the one who takes your souls by night and knows what you do by day. Then He raises you up again each day until your appointed time is fulfilled. In the end, you will return to Him, and He will show you the truth of all that you did. He is the irresistible, watching over His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. When death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty. Then people are returned to God, their true protector. His is the command, and He is the swiftest in taking account.

Say: 'Who delivers you from the dark recesses of land and sea when you call upon Him in humility and silent terror, saying, "If He only delivers us from these dangers, we will truly show our gratitude"?' Say: 'It is God who delivers you from these and all other distresses, yet you worship false gods!' Say: 'He has the power to send calamities on you from above and below, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance.' See how We explain the signs in various ways so that they may understand. But your people reject this, though it is the truth. Say: 'I am not responsible for arranging your affairs.' For every message, there is a limit of time, and soon you will know it.

When you see people engaged in vain discourse about Our signs, turn away from them unless they change the topic. If Satan ever makes you forget, then after recollection, do not sit with those who do wrong. The righteous are not accountable for them, but their duty is to remind them so that they may learn to fear God. Leave those who take their religion as mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world. But proclaim to them this truth: every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts. It will find no protector or intercessor except God. If it offered every ransom, none would be accepted. Such is the end of those who ruin themselves by their own acts. They will have boiling water to drink and a grievous punishment because they rejected God.

Say: 'Shall we call on others besides God, things that can neither benefit nor harm us, and turn back after receiving guidance from God? Like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool, wandering bewildered through the earth, his friends calling, "Come to us," vainly guiding him to the path.' Say: 'God's guidance is the only guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds.' Should we turn back after God has guided us, like someone whom the devils have led astray, wandering confused on the earth? He has friends calling him to the right path, saying, 'Come to us.' Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance, and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds.' To establish regular prayers and to fear God, for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together.

He created the heavens and the earth in true proportions. When He says, 'Be,' it is. His word is the truth. His will is the dominion on the day the trumpet will be blown. He knows the unseen and the seen. He is the Wise, well-acquainted with all things. Remember when Abraham said to his father Azar, 'Do you take idols for gods? I see you and your people in clear error.' Thus, We showed Abraham the power and laws of the heavens and the earth so that he might have certainty. When the night covered him, he saw a star and said, 'This is my Lord.' But when it set, he said, 'I do not love those that set.' When he saw the moon rising, he said, 'This is my Lord.' But when it set, he said, 'Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among those who go astray.' When he saw the sun rising, he said, 'This is my Lord; this is the greatest.' But when the sun set, he said, 'O my people! I am indeed free from your guilt of giving partners to God.' I have set my face firmly and truly towards Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I will never give partners to God.

His people disputed with him. He said, 'Do you dispute with me about God when He has guided me? I do not fear those you associate with Him unless my Lord wills. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Will you not be admonished?' How should I fear those you associate with God when you do not fear to give partners to God without any warrant? Which of the two parties has more right to security? If you know, it is those who believe and do not mix their faith with wrongdoing. They are truly in security and rightly guided. That was the reasoning We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise whom We will, degree after degree. Your Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.

We gave him Isaac and Jacob, all guided. Before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do good. And Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, all in the ranks of the righteous. And Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot. We gave favor to all above the nations. With some of their forefathers, their offspring, and their brethren, We chose them and guided them to a straight path. This is the guidance of God. He gives that guidance to whom He pleases among His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him, all that they did would be in vain. These were the men to whom We gave the Book, authority, and prophethood. If their descendants reject them, We shall entrust their charge to a new people who will not reject them. Those were the prophets who received God's guidance. Follow their guidance. Say: 'No reward do I ask of you for this. It is no less than a message for the nations.'""make a just estimate of God when they say, 'Nothing does God send down to man by way of revelation.' Say: 'Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for the people?'"

Say: 'God sent it down.' Then leave them to their pointless arguments. They don't truly understand God's power when they say He hasn't revealed anything to humans. Ask them, 'Who revealed the Book that Moses brought, a light and guidance for people?' You make it into separate writings, showing some parts and hiding others. You were taught things you and your ancestors didn't know. Say: 'God sent it down.' Then leave them to their idle talk. This is a blessed Book We have sent down, confirming previous revelations, so you may warn the central city and those around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this Book and are diligent in their prayers. 

Who is more wicked than someone who invents lies about God or claims, 'I have received inspiration,' when they haven't, or says, 'I can reveal something like what God has revealed'? If you could see the wrongdoers in the throes of death, with angels stretching out their hands saying, 'Give up your souls. Today you will be repaid with a penalty of shame for lying about God and arrogantly rejecting His signs.' You come to Us alone, as We created you the first time, leaving behind all the blessings We gave you. We don't see your intercessors, whom you claimed had a share in your affairs. All your ties are now cut off, and your assumptions have failed you. 

God causes the seed and date-stone to split and sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. That is God. How are you then turned away from the truth? He splits the daybreak and makes the night for rest, and the sun and moon for timekeeping. This is the judgment of the Mighty, the Wise. He made the stars for you to navigate through the darkness of land and sea. We have detailed Our signs for people who know. He created you from a single person and provided a place of sojourn and departure. We have detailed Our signs for people who understand. He sends down rain from the sky, producing vegetation of all kinds. From it, We bring forth green crops, grain, date clusters, gardens of grapes, olives, and pomegranates, similar yet different. Look at their fruit when they bear and ripen. These are signs for people who believe. 

Yet they make the jinn equals with God, though He created them. They falsely attribute sons and daughters to Him without knowledge. Praise and glory be to Him, above what they attribute to Him! He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no consort? He created everything and knows all things. That is God, your Lord. There is no god but Him, the Creator of all things. Worship Him, for He takes care of all affairs.

God oversees everything. No one can fully grasp Him, but He sees everything. He is beyond our understanding, yet He knows all. Clear signs have come from your Lord. If you choose to see, it's for your own benefit; if you choose to be blind, it's to your own detriment. I'm not here to control your actions. We explain our signs in various ways so people might say, "You have studied well," and so we can make things clear for those who seek knowledge. Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord; there is no god but Him. Turn away from those who associate others with God. If God had willed, they wouldn't have worshipped false gods. You are not responsible for their actions. Don't insult those they worship besides God, as they might insult God out of ignorance. Every nation finds its own deeds appealing. In the end, they will return to their Lord, and He will inform them of what they did. 

They swear by God that if a special sign came to them, they would believe. Say, "All signs are with God." But even if signs came, they wouldn't believe. We will turn their hearts and eyes away because they refused to believe initially. We will leave them to wander blindly in their defiance. Even if we sent angels, made the dead speak, and gathered everything before them, they wouldn't believe unless God willed it. Most of them ignore the truth. We have made enemies for every prophet, including evil ones among humans and jinn, who deceive with fancy words. If your Lord had willed, they wouldn't have done it. So leave them and their fabrications alone. Let those who don't believe in the Hereafter be drawn to deceit and take pleasure in it. They will earn what they deserve. 

Say, "Shall I seek a judge other than God when He has sent you the Book, explained in detail?" Those who received the Book know it is from your Lord in truth. Don't be among the doubters. The word of your Lord is fulfilled in truth and justice. No one can change His words. He hears and knows everything. If you follow the majority on earth, they will lead you away from God's path. They follow nothing but conjecture and lies. Your Lord knows best who strays and who is rightly guided. Eat what God's name has been pronounced over if you believe in His signs. Why shouldn't you eat what God's name has been mentioned over when He has explained what is forbidden, except in cases of necessity? Many are misled by their desires due to ignorance. Your Lord knows best who transgresses. Avoid all sin, whether open or secret. Those who earn sin will be repaid for what they have earned. Don't eat meat on which God's name hasn't been mentioned.

Don't eat meat that hasn't had God's name mentioned over it; it's sinful. The devils encourage their followers to argue with you, but if you follow them, you'll become idolaters. Can someone who was spiritually dead and then given life and guidance be like someone who remains in darkness? To non-believers, their actions seem appealing. In every town, we've placed leaders among the wicked to plot, but they only harm themselves without realizing it. When a sign from God comes, they demand more, saying they won't believe until they receive the same as God's messengers. God knows best where to place His message. The wicked will face humiliation and severe punishment for their schemes. Those whom God guides, He opens their hearts to Islam. Those He leaves astray, He makes their hearts tight and constricted, as if they were climbing to the sky. This is how God punishes those who refuse to believe. This is the straight path of your Lord. We have detailed our signs for those who heed the warning. For the righteous, there will be a home of peace with their Lord, who will be their friend because of their good deeds. 

On the Day of Judgment, God will gather the jinn and humans and say, "O assembly of jinn! You misled many humans." Their human friends will say, "Our Lord, we benefited from each other, but now we've reached our appointed term." God will say, "The Fire is your home, to dwell in forever, except as God wills." Your Lord is Wise and Knowing. We make wrongdoers turn to each other because of their actions. God sent messengers to warn you, but you were deceived by worldly life and rejected faith. Your Lord wouldn't destroy towns unjustly while their people were unaware. Everyone will be judged according to their deeds. Your Lord is not unaware of what they do. He is self-sufficient and full of mercy. If He wills, He can replace you with others, just as He raised you from the descendants of other people. What you are promised will surely come to pass, and you cannot escape it. 

Say, "O my people, do whatever you can; I will do my part. Soon you will know who will have a good end in the Hereafter. The wrongdoers will not succeed." They assign a portion of their crops and cattle to God and another portion to their idols. What they assign to their idols doesn't reach God, but what they assign to God goes to their idols. This is an evil and unjust practice. They say that certain cattle and crops are forbidden, and only specific people can eat them. They also claim that some cattle are not to be used for work or that God's name should not be mentioned when slaughtering them. These are lies against God, and He will punish them for their fabrications. They also say that what is in the wombs of certain cattle is reserved for men and forbidden for women, but if it is stillborn, everyone can share it. God will punish them for these false claims. They have indeed gone astray and are not following the right path. 

God is the one who creates gardens, both trellised and untrellised, date palms, crops of different flavors, olives, and pomegranates. Eat their fruits when they ripen and give the due share on the day of harvest. Do not waste, for God does not love those who waste. Some cattle are for carrying burdens, and some are for meat. Eat what God has provided and do not follow Satan's footsteps, for he is your clear enemy. There are eight pairs of cattle: two of sheep, two of goats, two of camels, and two of oxen. Ask them if God has forbidden the males, the females, or what is in the wombs of the females. They should provide knowledge if they are truthful. Who is more unjust than one who lies about God to mislead people without knowledge? God does not guide the unjust. 

Say, "I do not find anything forbidden to eat except dead meat, blood, pork (which is impure), or meat sacrificed in the name of other than God. But if someone is forced by necessity without willful disobedience, God is Forgiving and Merciful." For those who follow Jewish law, God forbade animals with undivided hooves and the fat of oxen and sheep, except what is on their backs, entrails, or mixed with bones. This was a punishment for their disobedience, and God's ordinances are true. If they accuse you of lying, say, "Your Lord is full of all-encompassing mercy, but His punishment will not be averted from the guilty." Those who associate partners with God will say, "If God had willed, we would not hSay, "If God had willed, we wouldn't have worshipped others or forbidden anything." This is the same argument their ancestors used until they faced God's punishment. Ask them, "Do you have any knowledge to support this?" They only follow assumptions and lies. Say, "God has the final argument. If He had willed, He could have guided all of you." Ask them to bring witnesses to prove that God forbade certain things. If they bring witnesses, don't join them. Don't follow the desires of those who deny God's signs and don't believe in the Hereafter. Say, "Come, let me tell you what God has really forbidden: Don't associate anything with Him, be good to your parents, don't kill your children out of poverty—we provide for you and them. Avoid shameful deeds, whether open or secret, and don't take a life that God has made sacred, except by way of justice. This is what He commands you, so you may learn wisdom." Don't approach the property of orphans except to improve it until they reach maturity. Give full measure and weight with justice. We don't burden any soul beyond its capacity. When you speak, be just, even if it's against a relative. Fulfill God's covenant so you may remember. This is My straight path, so follow it. Don't follow other paths, as they will lead you away from His way. This is what He has ordained for you, so you may be righteous.

We gave Moses the Book, completing Our favor to those who do right, explaining all things in detail, and as a guide and mercy, so they might believe in meeting their Lord. This is a blessed Book We have revealed. Follow it and be righteous so you may receive mercy. Don't say, "The Book was sent down to two groups before us, and we were unaware of what they read." Or, "If the Book had been sent to us, we would have followed its guidance better." Now a clear sign has come to you from your Lord, a guide and mercy. Who is more unjust than one who rejects God's signs and turns away from them? We will punish those who turn away from Our signs with a dreadful penalty. Are they waiting for the angels to come to them, or for your Lord to come, or for some signs of your Lord? On the day when some signs of your Lord come, no soul will benefit from its faith if it didn't believe before or earn good through its faith. Say, "Wait, we too are waiting."

As for those who divide their religion and break into sects, you have no part in them. Their affair is with God, who will tell them the truth of all they did. Whoever does good will have ten times the credit. Whoever does evil will only be recompensed according to their evil. No wrong will be done to them. Say, "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the path of Abraham, who was true in faith and did not join gods with God." Say: "My Lord has guided me to the right path, the true faith of Abraham, who was upright and not a polytheist. My prayer, my worship, my life, and my death are all for God, the Lord of the Worlds. He has no partner. This is what I am commanded, and I am the first to submit to His will." Say: "Shall I seek a lord other than God, when He is the Lord of all things? Every soul earns only for itself, and no one can bear another's burden. Your return is to God, and He will inform you of what you used to dispute." He is the one who made you inheritors of the earth and raised some of you above others in rank to test you with what He has given you. Your Lord is swift in punishment, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.

Chapter 7: Al-Araf (The Heights)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad. This is a Book revealed to you, so let there be no distress in your heart because of it. It is meant to warn and remind the believers. Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other protectors besides Him. Little do you remember! How many towns have We destroyed for their sins? Our punishment came upon them suddenly by night or while they slept at noon. When Our punishment took them, their only cry was, "Indeed, we were wrongdoers." We will question those to whom Our message was sent and those by whom We sent it. We will recount their story with knowledge, for We were never absent. The weighing on that day will be just. Those whose scale of good deeds is heavy will prosper, and those whose scale is light will lose their souls because they wrongfully treated Our signs. We have placed you with authority on earth and provided you with means for your livelihood, yet little thanks do you give.

We created you and gave you shape, then told the angels to prostrate to Adam, and they did, except for Iblis who refused. God said, "What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?" Iblis said, "I am better than him. You created me from fire and him from clay." God said, "Get down from here. It is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of the meanest." Iblis said, "Give me respite till the day they are raised up." God said, "You are among those given respite." Iblis said, "Because You have thrown me out of the way, I will lie in wait for them on Your straight path. Then I will assault them from before them and behind them, from their right and their left, and You will not find most of them grateful." God said, "Get out from here, disgraced and expelled. If any of them follow you, I will fill Hell with all of you."

"O Adam, dwell you and your wife in the Garden and eat from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or you will be among the wrongdoers." Then Satan whispered to them, revealing their shame that was hidden from them. He said, "Your Lord only forbade you this tree lest you become angels or immortal." Satan whispered to them, revealing their hidden shame, and said, "Your Lord only forbade you this tree so you wouldn't become angels or immortals." He swore to them, "I am a sincere adviser to you." By deceit, he led them to their downfall. When they tasted the tree, their shame became apparent, and they began to cover themselves with leaves. Their Lord called out, "Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is your enemy?" They replied, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will be lost." God said, "Descend, with enmity between yourselves. On earth, you will live and die, and from it, you will be resurrected."

"O Children of Adam, We have given you clothing to cover your shame and as an adornment. But the clothing of righteousness is the best. These are signs from God so you may remember. Do not let Satan seduce you as he did your parents, stripping them of their innocence to expose their shame. He and his tribe see you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils friends to those who do not believe." When they commit shameful acts, they say, "We found our ancestors doing this, and God commanded us to do so." Say, "God does not command shameful deeds. Do you say about God what you do not know?" Say, "My Lord commands justice. Set your faces towards Him at every place of worship and call upon Him sincerely. As He created you in the beginning, so shall you return." Some He has guided, while others have chosen error, taking devils as protectors instead of God, thinking they are rightly guided.

"O Children of Adam, wear your beautiful apparel at every place of prayer, eat and drink, but do not waste, for God does not love the wasteful." Say, "Who has forbidden the beautiful gifts of God, which He has produced for His servants, and the clean and pure things for sustenance?" Say, "They are for those who believe in this life, and purely for them on the Day of Judgment." Thus, We explain the signs in detail for those who understand. Say, "My Lord has forbidden shameful deeds, whether open or secret, sins, wrongful oppression, associating partners with God without any authority, and saying things about God without knowledge." Every nation has its appointed term. When their time comes, they cannot delay it nor advance it.

"O Children of Adam, when messengers come to you from among yourselves, reciting My signs, those who are righteous and mend their ways will have no fear nor will they grieve. But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein forever." Those who deny Our revelations and scorn them are destined for the Fire, where they will remain forever. Who is more unjust than the one who invents lies about God or rejects His signs? When our messengers come to take their souls, they will ask, "Where are those you used to invoke besides God?" They will reply, "They have abandoned us," and they will admit their disbelief. God will say, "Enter the Fire with the people who passed before you, both humans and jinn." Each time a new group enters, they will curse the ones before them. The last group will say, "Our Lord, they misled us, so give them double the punishment." God will respond, "Each will have double, but you do not understand." The first group will say to the last, "You were no better than us, so taste the punishment for what you did."

Those who reject Our signs and act arrogantly will not have the gates of heaven opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. They will have Hell as their bed and coverings. This is how We repay wrongdoers. But those who believe and do good deeds, within their capacity, will be the rightful owners of Paradise, where they will live forever. We will remove any ill feelings from their hearts, and rivers will flow beneath them. They will say, "Praise be to God, who guided us to this. We would not have been guided if God had not guided us.""The messengers of our Lord brought the truth." They will hear a voice saying, "This is the Paradise you have inherited because of your deeds." The people of Paradise will call out to the people of the Fire, "We have found our Lord's promises to be true. Have you found your Lord's promises to be true?" They will say, "Yes," and a voice will proclaim, "The curse of God is on the wrongdoers who hinder others from God's path and seek to make it crooked, and who do not believe in the Hereafter." Between them will be a barrier, and on the heights will be people who recognize everyone by their marks. They will call out to the people of Paradise, "Peace be upon you!" They will not have entered Paradise yet, but they will hope to. When their eyes turn towards the people of the Fire, they will say, "Our Lord, do not place us with the wrongdoers." The people on the heights will call out to certain men they recognize by their marks, saying, "What good did your hoards and arrogance do you? Are these the ones you swore God would never bless with His mercy? Enter Paradise; no fear will be upon you, nor will you grieve." The people of the Fire will call out to the people of Paradise, "Pour down some water or anything God has provided for you." They will reply, "God has forbidden both to the disbelievers."

"Those who took their religion as mere amusement and were deceived by worldly life will be forgotten by Us today, just as they forgot about this Day and rejected Our signs. We had sent them a Book, explained with knowledge, as a guide and mercy for believers. Are they waiting for the final fulfillment of the event? On that day, those who ignored it will say, 'The messengers of our Lord brought the truth. Do we have any intercessors to help us, or can we be sent back to act differently?' They will realize they have lost their souls, and their inventions will abandon them. Your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and established Himself on the throne. He covers the night with the day, and created the sun, moon, and stars, all governed by His command. Blessed be God, the Lord of the worlds! Call on your Lord with humility and in private, for He does not love those who exceed limits. Do not cause mischief on the earth after it has been set in order, and call on Him with fear and hope. His mercy is near to those who do good. He sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, bringing heavy clouds to a dead land, making rain descend and produce every kind of harvest. This is how We will raise the dead, so you may remember. From good land springs rich produce by the will of its Cherisher, but from bad land springs only scanty growth. We explain the signs in various ways for those who are grateful.

We sent Noah to his people, saying, 'O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day.' The leaders of his people said, 'We see you are clearly in error.' Noah replied, 'O my people! There is no error in me; I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. I convey the messages of my Lord and give you sincere advice, knowing from God what you do not know. Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you, to warn you and so you may receive His mercy?' But they rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned those who denied Our signs. They were indeed a blind people.

To the 'Ad people, We sent Hud, one of their own. He said, 'O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. Will you not fear God?' The leaders of the unbelievers among his people said, 'We see you are an imbecile and a liar.' Hud replied, 'O my people! I am not an imbecile; I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. I convey the messages of my Lord and am a sincere and trustworthy adviser.' And I am a faithful adviser to you. Do you find it strange that a message from your Lord has come through a man from among you to warn you? Remember that He made you successors after the people of Noah and gave you stature among the nations. Recall the benefits you have received from God so you may prosper." They responded, "Have you come to us to worship God alone and abandon what our ancestors worshipped? If you are truthful, bring us what you threaten us with." He said, "Punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your Lord. Do you argue with me over names you and your ancestors invented without any authority from God? Then wait, I am also waiting with you." We saved him and those who followed him by Our mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and did not believe.

To the Thamud people, We sent Salih, one of their own. He said, "O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. A clear sign has come to you from your Lord. This she-camel of God is a sign for you, so let her graze freely and do not harm her, or you will face a severe punishment." Remember how He made you successors after the 'Ad people and gave you homes in the land. You build palaces in the plains and carve homes in the mountains. Remember the benefits you have received from God and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth. The leaders of the arrogant among his people said to those who were considered weak and believed, "Do you know that Salih is a messenger from his Lord?" They replied, "We believe in the message he has been sent with." The arrogant ones said, "We reject what you believe in." Then they hamstrung the she-camel and defied the order of their Lord, saying, "O Salih! Bring about your threats if you are truly a messenger." So the earthquake seized them, and they lay prostrate in their homes by morning. Salih turned away from them, saying, "O my people! I conveyed my Lord's message to you and gave you good counsel, but you do not love good advisers."

We also sent Lot. He said to his people, "Do you commit lewdness such as no people before you have ever committed? You lust after men instead of women. You are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds." His people responded, "Drive them out of your city; they are people who want to be clean and pure!" But We saved him and his family, except his wife, who was among those who lagged behind. We rained down on them a shower of brimstone. See what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!

To the Madyan people, We sent Shu'aib, one of their own. He said, "O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. A clear sign has come to you from your Lord. Give just measure and weight, do not withhold from people what is rightfully theirs, and do not cause mischief on the earth after it has been set in order. This will be better for you if you have faith." "And do not squat on every road, threatening and hindering those who believe in God, seeking to make it crooked. Remember how you were few, and He gave you increase. And keep in mind what was the fate of those who caused corruption. If some of you believe in the message I bring and others do not, be patient until God decides between us. He is the best judge." The arrogant leaders among his people said, "Shu'aib, we will drive you and those who believe with you out of our city unless you return to our ways." Shu'aib replied, "Even if we detest them? We would be lying against God if we returned to your ways after He has saved us from them. We cannot return to them unless God wills it. Our Lord knows everything. We trust in God. Our Lord, decide between us and our people with truth, for You are the best judge." The disbelieving leaders said, "If you follow Shu'aib, you will be ruined." But the earthquake took them by surprise, and they lay lifeless in their homes by morning. Those who denied Shu'aib were as if they had never lived there. They were the losers. Shu'aib turned away from them, saying, "O my people, I delivered my Lord's messages to you and gave you good advice. How can I grieve for a people who refuse to believe?"

Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We afflicted its people with suffering and adversity so they might humble themselves. Then We changed their suffering into prosperity until they grew and multiplied, saying, "Our ancestors also faced suffering and prosperity." Then We seized them suddenly, while they were unaware. If the people of the towns had believed and feared God, We would have opened blessings from the heavens and the earth for them. But they rejected the truth, so We punished them for their misdeeds. Do the people of the towns feel secure from Our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep? Or do they feel secure from it coming in broad daylight while they play? Do they feel secure from God's plan? Only those doomed to ruin feel secure from God's plan. Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its previous inhabitants that We could punish them for their sins and seal their hearts so they cannot hear? These are the towns whose stories We relate to you. Their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they would not believe what they had previously rejected. Thus, God seals the hearts of those who reject faith. Most of them were not true to their covenant; most of them were rebellious and disobedient.

After them, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See the fate of those who caused corruption. Moses said to Pharaoh, "I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. I must speak only the truth about God. I have come to you with a clear sign from your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with me." Pharaoh responded, "If you have a sign, show it to us if you are truthful." Moses then threw his rod, and it turned into a visible serpent. He also drew out...Moses showed his hand, and it appeared white to everyone. Pharaoh's chiefs said, "This is a skilled sorcerer trying to drive you out of your land. What should we do?" They suggested keeping Moses and his brother in suspense and summoning all the skilled sorcerers. The sorcerers asked Pharaoh if they would be rewarded if they won, and he promised them rewards and positions close to him. They asked Moses if he would throw first or if they should. Moses told them to go first. They cast a spell that bewitched the people's eyes and struck fear into them. Then God inspired Moses to throw his rod, which swallowed up all the falsehoods. The truth was confirmed, and the sorcerers were defeated and humbled. They fell in prostration, declaring their belief in the Lord of Moses and Aaron. Pharaoh said, "You believe in Him before I give you permission? This is a plot to drive out the people of the city. I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you all." The sorcerers replied, "We are returning to our Lord. You only take revenge on us because we believed in the signs of our Lord. Our Lord, give us patience and let us die as Muslims."

Pharaoh's chiefs asked, "Will you let Moses and his people spread mischief and abandon you and your gods?" Pharaoh decided to kill their sons and spare their women, asserting his power over them. Moses told his people to seek help from God and be patient, for the earth belongs to God, and He gives it to whom He wills. The end is best for the righteous. The people complained of their suffering before and after Moses came. Moses reassured them that God might destroy their enemy and make them inheritors of the land to test their deeds. God punished Pharaoh's people with droughts and crop failures to remind them. When good times came, they claimed it was due to their own efforts. When calamity struck, they blamed it on Moses and his followers. In truth, their misfortune was from God, but most did not understand. They told Moses, "No matter what signs you bring, we will never believe in you."

So, God sent plagues upon them: widespread death, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood—clear signs. But they were arrogant and sinful. Every time a penalty fell on them, they said, "O Moses! Call upon your Lord on our behalf, as He has promised you. If you remove the penalty, we will believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you." But when God removed the penalty for a fixed term, they broke their promise. So, God took retribution and drowned them in the sea because they rejected His signs and ignored them. He made the oppressed people inherit the lands in the east and west, which He had blessed. The promise of the Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they were patient. God destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had built.

The Children of Israel crossed the sea and came upon a people devoted to idols. They said, "O Moses! Make for us a god like theirs." Moses replied, "You are ignorant people. Their way will be destroyed, and their worship is in vain." Moses continued, "Shall I seek a god for you other than God, who has favored you above all others?" Remember when God rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who inflicted terrible torment on you, killing your sons and sparing your women. That was a great trial from your Lord. God appointed for Moses thirty nights and added ten more, completing forty nights. Moses told his brother Aaron, "Take my place among the people, do right, and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers."

When Moses came to the appointed place and his Lord spoke to him, he said, "O my Lord! Show Yourself to me so I may look upon You." God replied, "You cannot see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains firm, then you will see Me." When God revealed His glory to the mountain, it crumbled, and Moses fell unconscious. When he recovered, he said, "Glory be to You! I repent to You, and I am the first to believe." God said, "O Moses! I have chosen you above others by My messages and My words. Hold firmly to what I have given you and be thankful." God wrote for him on the tablets instructions and explanations for everything. He said, "Hold firmly to these and command your people to follow the best of them. I will show you the homes of the wicked."

Those who are arrogant on earth without right, God will turn away from His signs. Even if they see all the signs, they will not believe. If they see the way of righteousness, they will not take it, but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it. This is because they have rejected God's signs and ignored them. Those who reject God's signs and the meeting in the Hereafter will find their deeds meaningless. Can they expect any reward other than what they have done?

The people of Moses, in his absence, made a calf from their ornaments for worship. It made a lowing sound, but it could neither speak to them nor guide them. They took it for worship and did wrong. When they realized their mistake, they said, "If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will surely be among the lost." When Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, "What a terrible thing you have done in my absence! Did you hasten the judgment of your Lord?" He threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the hair, dragging him. Aaron said, "Son of my mother! The people considered me weak and almost killed me. Do not let the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count me among the wrongdoers." Moses prayed, "O my Lord! Forgive me and my brother! Admit us to Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."

Those who took the calf for worship will face wrath from their Lord and shame in this life. This is how God repays those who invent falsehoods. But those who do wrong and then repent and believe will find their Lord Forgiving and Merciful. When Moses' anger subsided, he picked up the tablets, which contained guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord. Moses chose seventy of his people for God's meeting. When they were seized with a violent quaking, he prayed, "O my Lord! If it had been Your will, You could have destroyed them and me long before. Will You destroy us for the deeds of the foolish among us? This is only Your trial. You lead astray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best of those who forgive." Moses continued, "Ordain for us what is good in this life and in the Hereafter, for we have turned to You." God replied, "I will punish whom I will, but My mercy encompasses all things. I will ordain it for those who do right, practice regular charity, and believe in Our signs."

Those who follow the messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their scriptures, will prosper. He commands them what is just, forbids what is evil, allows what is good, and prohibits what is bad. He releases them from their heavy burdens and yokes. Those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light sent down with him will be successful. Say, "O people! I am sent to you all as the Messenger of God, to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and death. So believe in God and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in God and His words. Follow him so that you may be guided."

Among the people of Moses, there was a group who guided others with truth and upheld justice. God divided them into twelve tribes or nations. When Moses' people were thirsty, God inspired him to strike a rock with his staff, and twelve springs gushed forth, each tribe knowing its own drinking place. God provided them with shade from clouds and sent down manna and quails, telling them to eat the good things He provided. However, they rebelled, harming only themselves. God told them to live in a town, eat as they wished, and enter the gate humbly, promising to forgive their faults and increase the reward for those who do good. But some of them changed the word given to them, so God sent a plague from heaven as punishment for their repeated transgressions.

Ask them about the town by the sea where they broke the Sabbath. On the Sabbath, fish would come to them openly, but on other days, they did not. This was a test for their transgression. When some asked why they preached to people whom God would destroy, the preachers said it was to fulfill their duty to their Lord and perhaps the people might fear Him. When they ignored the warnings, God rescued those who forbade evil and punished the wrongdoers severely for their transgressions. When they persisted in their disobedience, God said to them, "Be despised apes." Your Lord declared He would send against them those who would afflict them with severe punishment until the Day of Judgment. Your Lord is swift in retribution but also Forgiving and Merciful. God scattered them into different nations on earth, some righteous and some not. He tested them with both prosperity and adversity so they might return to Him.

After them came a generation that inherited the Book but chose the vanities of this world, thinking they would be forgiven. If similar vanities came their way, they would seize them again. They were supposed to uphold the truth about God, as stated in the Book, and they studied it. The home in the Hereafter is better for the righteous. Do you not understand? Those who hold fast to the Book and establish regular prayer will not lose their reward. When God shook the Mount over them, they thought it would fall on them. He told them to hold firmly to what He had given them and remember its contents so they might fear God. When your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam their descendants and made them testify concerning themselves, saying, "Am I not your Lord?""Am I not your Lord?" They said, "Yes, we testify," to prevent them from claiming ignorance on the Day of Judgment. On the Day of Resurrection, people might say, "We were unaware of this." When your Lord brought forth the descendants of Adam and made them testify about themselves, asking, "Am I not your Lord?" They replied, "Yes, we testify," to prevent them from claiming ignorance on Judgment Day. Or they might say, "Our ancestors worshipped false gods, and we are their descendants. Will You destroy us for what they did?" We explain Our signs in detail so they might return to Us.

Tell them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he ignored them, and Satan led him astray. If We had willed, We could have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to the earth and followed his desires. His example is like a dog: whether you chase it away or leave it alone, it pants with its tongue out. This is the example of those who reject Our signs. Tell them this story so they might reflect. Evil is the example of people who reject Our signs and wrong themselves. Those whom God guides are on the right path, but those He leads astray are the losers. Many jinn and humans are destined for Hell because they have hearts that don't understand, eyes that don't see, and ears that don't hear. They are like cattle, but worse, because they are heedless.

The most beautiful names belong to God, so call on Him by them and avoid those who misuse His names. They will be repaid for what they do. Among those We created are people who guide others with truth and establish justice. Those who reject Our signs will be gradually punished in ways they don't perceive. I give them time, but My plan is strong. Do they not reflect? Their companion is not mad; he is just a clear warner. Do they not see the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that God has created? Their end might be near. In what message will they believe after this? Those whom God leads astray have no guide. He leaves them to wander blindly in their defiance.

They ask you about the final Hour—when will it come? Say, "The knowledge of it is with my Lord alone. Only He can reveal when it will occur. It is heavy in the heavens and the earth and will come suddenly." They ask as if you are eager to know. Say, "The knowledge of it is with God alone, but most people do not know." Say, "I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as God wills. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I would have accumulated much good and no evil would have touched me. I am just a warner and a bringer of good news to those who have faith."

He created you from a single person and made his mate of like nature so he might dwell with her in love. When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it unnoticed. When she grows heavy, they both pray to God, their Lord, saying, "If You give us a good child, we will be grateful." But when He gives them a good child, they attribute part of the gift to others, but God is far above the partners they associate with Him. Do they really attribute to Him partners who create nothing and are themselves created? These partners can't help them or even help themselves. If you call them to guidance, they won't follow; it's the same whether you call them or stay silent. Those you call upon besides God are just like you. Call on them and see if they respond, if you are truthful. Do they have feet to walk, hands to hold, eyes to see, or ears to hear? Say, "Call your partners and plot against me without delay!" My protector is God, who revealed the Book and befriends the righteous. Those you call upon besides Him can't help you or themselves. If you call them to guidance, they won't hear. You'll see them looking at you, but they don't see.

Hold to forgiveness, command what is right, and turn away from the ignorant. If a suggestion from Satan troubles you, seek refuge with God; He hears and knows everything. Those who fear God, when touched by an evil thought from Satan, remember Him and see clearly. But their evil companions plunge them deeper into error and never stop. If you don't bring them a revelation, they say, "Why haven't you made one up?" Say, "I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This is insight, guidance, and mercy for those who believe." When the Qur'an is recited, listen and be silent so you may receive mercy. Remember your Lord humbly and with awe, quietly, in the mornings and evenings, and don't be among the heedless. Those near your Lord are not too proud to worship Him; they praise Him and prostrate before Him.

Chapter 8: AL-ANFAL (SPOILS OF WAR, BOOTY)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. They ask you about the spoils of war. Say, "The spoils belong to God and the Messenger. So fear God, set right your differences, and obey God and His Messenger if you are true believers." True believers are those whose hearts tremble when God is mentioned, whose faith increases when His signs are recited, and who trust in their Lord. They establish regular prayers and spend from what We have provided them. These are the true believers; they have ranks of honor, forgiveness, and generous sustenance from their Lord.

Just as your Lord ordered you out of your house in truth, even though some believers disliked it, they disputed with you about the truth after it was made clear, as if they were being driven to death while they saw it. God promised you one of the two enemy parties, and you wished for the unarmed one, but God willed to justify the truth and cut off the roots of the unbelievers. God wanted to establish the truth and eliminate the disbelievers. When God promised you victory over one of the two enemy groups, you hoped it would be the unarmed one. But God intended to prove the truth and cut off the disbelievers. Even if the guilty dislike it, God will make the truth prevail and falsehood vanish.

Remember when you asked for your Lord's help, and He responded, "I will support you with a thousand angels in succession." God made this a message of hope to reassure your hearts. Victory comes only from God, who is powerful and wise. He sent down rain to cleanse you, remove Satan's influence, and strengthen your hearts and resolve. When your Lord inspired the angels, saying, "I am with you, so make the believers stand firm. I will instill fear in the hearts of the disbelievers. Strike them above their necks and cut off their fingertips." This is because they opposed God and His Messenger. Whoever opposes God and His Messenger will face severe punishment. Taste this punishment, for those who resist God will face the penalty of the Fire.

Believers, when you face the disbelievers in battle, do not turn your backs on them. If anyone turns their back on such a day, unless maneuvering for battle or joining another group, they incur God's wrath, and their abode will be Hell. It was not you who killed them, but God. When you threw a handful of dust, it was not your act, but God's, to test the believers. God is all-hearing and all-knowing. God weakens the plans of the disbelievers. If you sought a judgment, it has come to you. If you desist, it will be better for you. If you return to the attack, so will We. Your forces will not help you, no matter how many, for God is with the believers.

Believers, obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away when you hear him speak. Do not be like those who say, "We hear," but do not listen. The worst creatures in God's sight are the deaf and dumb who do not understand. If God had found any good in them, He would have made them listen. But even if He made them listen, they would turn away. Believers, respond to God and His Messenger when He calls you to what gives you life. Know that God comes between a person and their heart, and to Him, you will be gathered. Fear the trial that will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. Know that God is severe in punishment.

Remember when you were few and weak in the land, fearing that people might capture you. God provided you with a safe refuge, strengthened you with His help, and gave you good things so you might be grateful. Believers, do not betray God and His Messenger, nor misappropriate what is entrusted to you knowingly. Believers, do not betray God and His Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly. Understand that your possessions and children are a test, and with God lies your greatest reward. If you fear God, He will give you the ability to distinguish right from wrong, remove your sins, and forgive you. God is infinitely gracious.

Remember how the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison, kill, or expel you. They plotted, but God also planned, and He is the best of planners. When Our signs are recited to them, they dismiss them as ancient tales. They even challenged, "O God, if this is the truth from You, rain down stones on us or send a painful punishment." But God would not punish them while you were among them, nor while they sought forgiveness. What excuse do they have for God not to punish them when they prevent people from the Sacred Mosque, which they are not fit to guard? Only the righteous are its true guardians, but most of them do not understand. Their prayer at the House of God is nothing but whistling and clapping. They will taste the punishment for their disbelief.

Disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder people from God's path. They will continue to spend, but it will only bring them regret and defeat. Ultimately, they will be gathered to Hell. God will separate the impure from the pure, heap the impure together, and cast them into Hell. They are the true losers. Tell the disbelievers that if they cease their actions, their past will be forgiven. But if they persist, they will face the same fate as those before them. Fight them until there is no more persecution and religion is solely for God.Travel freely in the land for four months, but know that you cannot escape God, and He will bring disgrace to the unbelievers. An announcement from God and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Great Pilgrimage: God and His Messenger dissolve treaty obligations with the pagans. If you repent, it is better for you, but if you turn away, know that you cannot frustrate God. Announce a severe penalty to those who reject faith.

This is a proclamation from God and His Messenger to all people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage that God and His Messenger are free from obligations to the idolaters. If you repent, it will be better for you, but if you are averse, know that you cannot escape God. Muhammad, give news of a painful doom to those who disbelieve. However, the treaties are not dissolved with those pagans with whom you have entered into an alliance and who have not failed you in any way or supported anyone against you. Fulfill your engagements with them until the end of their term, for God loves the righteous.

When the forbidden months are over, fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them in every strategy of war. But if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practice regular charity, then let them go their way. God is Forgiving and Merciful. If one of the pagans asks for your protection, grant it to him so that he may hear the word of God, and then escort him to a place where he can be secure. This is because they are people without knowledge.

How can there be a treaty with God and His Messenger for the idolaters, except those with whom you made a treaty near the Sacred Mosque? As long as they are true to you, be true to them. God loves the righteous. How can there be such a treaty when, if they get an advantage over you, they do not respect the ties of kinship or covenant? They entice you with fair words, but their hearts are against you, and most of them are rebellious and wicked. They have sold the signs of God for a small price and have hindered many from His way. Evil indeed are the deeds they have done. They do not respect the ties of kinship or covenant with a believer. These are the transgressors.

But if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practice regular charity, they are your brothers in faith. We explain the signs in detail for those who understand. If they violate their oaths after their covenant and taunt you for your faith, fight the leaders of unfaith, for their oaths mean nothing to them. This is so they may be restrained. Will you not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger, and were the first to assault you? Do you fear them? No, it is God whom you should fear more justly if you believe. Fight them, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you to victory over them, and heal the hearts of believers. He will remove the anger from their hearts. God turns in mercy to whom He wills. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.Have you not seen those among you who strive with all their might and take no friends or protectors except God, His Messenger, and the community of believers? God is fully aware of all that you do. It is not for those who associate others with God to visit or maintain the mosques of God while they bear witness against their own souls to disbelief. Their deeds are fruitless, and they will dwell in the Fire. The mosques of God should be maintained by those who believe in God and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, give to charity, and fear none but God. These are the ones who are rightly guided.

Do you think providing water to pilgrims and maintaining the Sacred Mosque is equal to the deeds of those who believe in God and the Last Day and strive in His cause? They are not equal in the sight of God. God does not guide those who do wrong. Those who believe, leave their homes, and strive with their wealth and lives in God's cause have the highest rank in the sight of God. They are the ones who will achieve salvation. Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself, His good pleasure, and gardens where they will have lasting delights. They will dwell there forever. Truly, with God, there is a great reward.

O believers, do not take your fathers and brothers as protectors if they prefer disbelief over faith. If any of you do so, they are wrongdoers. Say: If your fathers, sons, brothers, spouses, relatives, the wealth you have gained, the commerce you fear may decline, or the homes you love are dearer to you than God, His Messenger, and striving in His cause, then wait until God brings about His decision. God does not guide the rebellious.

God has helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain. Your great numbers made you proud, but they did not benefit you. The land, despite its vastness, became narrow for you, and you turned back in retreat. But God sent down His calm on the Messenger and the believers, and sent forces you could not see. He punished the disbelievers. This is the reward for those without faith. After this, God will turn in mercy to whom He wills. God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.

O believers, the pagans are unclean, so let them not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year. If you fear poverty, God will enrich you out of His bounty if He wills. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Fight those who do not believe in God or the Last Day, do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, and do not follow the religion of truth, even if they are People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission and feel subdued.

The Jews say: Ezra is the son of God, and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of God. These are their words. They imitate the sayings of those who disbelieved before. May God curse them! How they are deluded away from the truth! They take their priests and monks as lords besides God, and also the Messiah, son of Mary. Yet they were commanded to worship only one God. There is no god but Him. Praise and glory to Him! He is far above what they associate with Him. They want to extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God will perfect His light, even though the disbelievers detest it. He is the One who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true religion to make it prevail over all other religions, even if the idolaters dislike it.

O believers, many priests and monks exploit people and turn them away from God. Those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in God's way will face severe punishment. On the Day of Judgment, their hoarded wealth will be heated in the fire of Hell and used to brand their foreheads, sides, and backs. They will be told, "This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you hoarded."

God has ordained twelve months in a year, four of which are sacred. Do not wrong yourselves during these months. Fight the pagans as they fight you, and know that God is with those who are mindful of Him. Changing the sacred months is an act of disbelief. The disbelievers manipulate the months to suit their desires, making lawful what God has forbidden. Their evil deeds seem pleasing to them, but God does not guide those who reject faith.

O believers, why do you hesitate when you are called to go forth in God's cause? Do you prefer the comforts of this world over the Hereafter? The pleasures of this world are insignificant compared to the Hereafter. If you do not go forth, God will punish you and replace you with others. You cannot harm Him in any way, for God has power over all things. If you do not support your leader, remember that God helped him when the disbelievers drove him out. He had only one companion, and they were in the cave. He said to his companion, "Do not grieve, for God is with us." God sent down His peace upon him and supported him with unseen forces, making the disbelievers' word the lowest and God's word the highest. God is Mighty and Wise.

Go forth, whether lightly or heavily armed, and strive with your wealth and lives in God's cause. This is best for you if you only knew. If the journey had been easy and the gain immediate, they would have followed you. But the distance was long, and they swore by God, "If we could, we would have come with you." They destroy their own souls, for God knows they are lying. God has forgiven you, Muhammad. Why did you grant them exemption before it was clear who was truthful and who was lying? Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask for exemption from striving with their wealth and lives. God knows those who are mindful of Him. Only those who do not believe in God and the Last Day ask for exemption. Their hearts are in doubt, and they waver in their doubts.

If they had truly intended to join you, they would have prepared for it. But God was averse to their participation, so He made them lag behind. If they had come with you, they would have only caused trouble, spreading discord among you. Some of you would have listened to them, but God knows who does wrong. They tried to cause problems before and disrupted things until the truth came and God's decree was revealed, even though they disliked it. Some of them say, "Give me permission to stay and don't test me." But they have already fallen into temptation, and Hell surrounds the disbelievers.

If good happens to you, it upsets them; if misfortune befalls you, they say, "We took precautions," and they turn away rejoicing. Say, "Nothing will happen to us except what God has decreed. He is our protector, and believers should trust in Him." Say, "Can you expect anything for us other than one of two good things (victory or martyrdom)? But we expect that God will punish you, either from Himself or by our hands. So wait, and we will wait with you." Say, "Spend willingly or unwillingly; it will not be accepted from you because you are rebellious people." The only reason their contributions are not accepted is that they disbelieve in God and His Messenger. They come to prayer lazily and give unwillingly.

Don't be impressed by their wealth or children. God intends to punish them with these things in this life, and their souls will perish while they are disbelievers. They swear by God that they are with you, but they are not; they are afraid. If they could find a place to hide, they would rush to it. Some of them criticize you about the distribution of alms. If they receive something, they are pleased; if not, they are angry. If only they were content with what God and His Messenger gave them and said, "God is enough for us. He will give us more from His bounty, and we turn our hopes to Him."

Alms are for the poor, the needy, those who collect them, those whose hearts need reconciliation, freeing captives, those in debt, in the cause of God, and for travelers. This is ordained by God, who is all-knowing and wise. Some people annoy the Prophet and say, "He listens to everything." Say, "He listens to what is best for you. He believes in God, trusts the believers, and is a mercy to those who believe." Those who annoy the Messenger will face a painful punishment. They swear by God to please you, but it is more fitting that they should please God and His Messenger if they are believers. Do they not realize that those who oppose God and His Messenger will face the fire of Hell, where they will remain forever? That is the ultimate disgrace.

The hypocrites fear that a revelation will expose what is in their hearts. Tell them, "Mock all you want! God will reveal what you fear." If you question them, they will say, "We were just joking and having fun." Respond, "Were you mocking God, His signs, and His Messenger?" Don't make excuses; you have rejected faith after accepting it. If we forgive some of you, others will be punished for their sins. Hypocrites, both men and women, support each other in wrongdoing. They promote evil, prevent good, and are stingy. They have forgotten God, so He has forgotten them. They are truly rebellious. God has promised the hypocrites and disbelievers the fire of Hell, where they will stay forever. This is their punishment, and they will face lasting torment. Just like those before you who were stronger and wealthier, they...They enjoyed their share of worldly pleasures, and so do you. But their deeds are worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and they are the true losers. Have they not heard about the people before them—Noah, 'Ad, Thamud, Abraham's people, the people of Midian, and the overthrown cities? Their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they wronged themselves.

Believers, both men and women, are protectors of one another. They promote good, prevent evil, establish prayer, give charity, and obey God and His Messenger. God will have mercy on them, for He is Mighty and Wise. God has promised believers gardens with rivers flowing beneath, where they will live forever. They will have beautiful homes in these gardens, and the greatest joy will be God's pleasure. This is the ultimate success.

O Prophet, strive hard against the disbelievers and hypocrites and be firm with them. Their final abode is Hell, a terrible destination. They swear by God that they said nothing wrong, but they did utter blasphemy and disbelieved after accepting Islam. They plotted but failed. If they repent, it will be better for them. If they turn away, God will punish them severely in this life and the Hereafter, and they will have no protector or helper.

Some of them made a promise to God that if He gave them from His bounty, they would give in charity and be righteous. But when He did give them, they became greedy and turned away. So, as a consequence, hypocrisy will remain in their hearts until the Day they meet Him, because they broke their promise to God. Because they lied repeatedly, God has instilled hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they meet Him. They broke their promise to God and lied. Don't they know that God is aware of their secret thoughts and private conversations? God knows everything unseen.

Those who mock the believers who give charity, whether they give a lot or a little, will face God's ridicule and a severe punishment. Whether you ask for their forgiveness or not, even if you ask seventy times, God will not forgive them because they rejected Him and His Messenger. God does not guide rebellious people.

Those who stayed behind during the Tabuk expedition were happy to avoid the effort and danger. They disliked striving with their wealth and lives for God's cause and said, "Don't go out in the heat." Tell them, "The fire of Hell is much hotter." If only they understood! Let them laugh a little; they will weep much as a consequence of their actions. If God brings you back to them and they ask to join you, say, "You will never come out with me or fight an enemy with me. You were content to stay behind the first time, so stay with those who lag behind." Never pray for any of them who dies or stand by their grave. They rejected God and His Messenger and died in a state of rebellion. Don't be impressed by their wealth or children. God's plan is to punish them with these things in this world and cause their souls to perish in disbelief.

When a revelation instructs them to believe in God and strive with His Messenger, the wealthy among them ask for exemption and say, "Leave us behind with those who stay at home." They prefer to be with those who remain behind. Their hearts are sealed, so they do not understand. But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and lives. They will receive all good things and will prosper. God has prepared gardens with rivers flowing beneath for them, where they will live forever. This is the ultimate success.

Some desert Arabs made excuses and asked for exemption, while others who lied to God and His Messenger stayed inactive. A severe punishment will fall on the disbelievers among them. There is no blame on the weak, the sick, or those who lack resources if they are sincere to God and His Messenger. There is no ground for complaint against those who do right. God is Forgiving and Merciful. Nor is there blame on those who came to you for mounts, and when you said, "I can't find mounts for you," they turned back with tears of grief because they had no resources. The blame is on those who seek exemption while being rich. They prefer to stay with those who remain behind. God has sealed their hearts, so they do not understand.

Those who ask for permission to stay behind despite being wealthy are content to be with the idle. God has sealed their hearts, so they do not understand. When you return to them, they will make excuses. Tell them, "Don't bother with excuses; we won't believe you. God has already informed us about you. Your actions will be observed by God and His Messenger, and eventually, you will be brought back to Him who knows everything hidden and visible. He will show you the truth of what you did." They will swear by God to you when you return, hoping you will leave them alone. Ignore them; they are unclean, and their home is Hell as a fitting punishment for their actions. They will swear to you to please you, but even if you are pleased with them, God is not pleased with those who disobey.

The desert Arabs are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy and are most likely to be ignorant of God's commands. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Some desert Arabs see their contributions as a fine and hope for your misfortune. They will face the disaster they wish upon you. God hears and knows everything. However, some desert Arabs believe in God and the Last Day and see their contributions as a way to get closer to God and earn the prayers of the Messenger. God will soon admit them to His mercy. God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.

The first to embrace Islam, the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who followed them in good deeds, are well-pleased with God, and He is pleased with them. He has prepared gardens with rivers flowing beneath for them, where they will live forever. This is the ultimate success. Among the desert Arabs and the people of Medina, there are hypocrites who are stubborn in their hypocrisy. You may not know them, but We know them. We will punish them twice, and then they will face a severe penalty. Others have acknowledged their wrongdoings, mixing good deeds with bad ones. Perhaps God will turn to them in mercy. God is Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Take alms from their wealth to purify and sanctify them, and pray for them. Your prayers are a source of comfort for them. God hears and knows everything. Don't they know that God accepts repentance and charity from His servants? God is the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. Tell them to act righteously. God, His Messenger, and the believers will observe their actions. They will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, who will inform them of what they did. Some are held in suspense, awaiting God's command, whether He will punish them or turn to them in mercy. God is All-Knowing, Wise.

There are those who built a mosque to cause harm, disbelief, and disunity among the believers, and as a base for those who previously fought against God and His Messenger. They will swear their intentions are good, but God declares they are liars. Never stand in that mosque. A mosque founded on piety from the first day is more deserving of your prayers. In it are people who love to purify themselves, and God loves those who purify themselves. Which is better: someone who builds their foundation on piety and seeking God's pleasure, or someone who builds on the edge of a crumbling cliff that collapses into the fire of Hell? God does not guide those who do wrong. The building they constructed will always cause doubt in their hearts until their hearts are torn apart. God is All-Knowing, Wise.

God has bought from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise. They fight in His cause, kill, and are killed. This is a true promise in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur'an. Who is more faithful to His promise than God? Rejoice in the bargain you have made, for it is the ultimate success. Those who repent, worship, praise, fast, bow down, prostrate, enjoin good, forbid evil, and observe God's limits—give them the good news.

It is not appropriate for the Prophet and the believers to ask for forgiveness for idolaters, even if they are close relatives, after it has become clear that they are destined for Hell. Abraham prayed for his father's forgiveness only because of a promise he made. But when it became clear that his father was an enemy of God, he disassociated himself from him. Abraham was tender-hearted and patient. God will not mislead a people after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should avoid. God knows all things. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and takes it. You have no protector or helper besides Him.

God turned in mercy to the Prophet, the Muhajirin, and the Ansar who followed him in difficult times, even when some hearts almost swerved. He turned to them in mercy, for He is Kind and Merciful. He also turned in mercy to the three who were left behind. They felt so guilty that the earth seemed to close in on them despite its vastness, and their souls were constricted. They realized there is no refuge from God except in Him. Then He turned to them so they might repent. God is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

O believers, fear God and be with those who are truthful. It was not appropriate for the people of Medina and the nearby Bedouins to refuse to follow God's Messenger or to prefer their own lives over his. Any suffering they endure—thirst, fatigue, hunger, or any step that angers the disbelievers or any injury from an enemy—is recorded as a good deed. God does not let the reward of those who do good be lost.Prioritize their own comfort over his mission. Any hardship they face—thirst, fatigue, hunger, or actions that anger the disbelievers—is recorded as a good deed. God does not let the reward of those who do good go to waste. Whether they spend a little or a lot for the cause, or cross a valley, it is all recorded for them so that God may reward them with the best of what they have done. Believers should not all go out to fight at once. A group from each community should stay behind to gain knowledge in religion and warn their people when they return, so they may be cautious. Believers, fight the disbelievers who are near you and let them find firmness in you. Know that God is with those who fear Him. Whenever a new chapter is revealed, some people ask, "Whose faith has increased because of this?" For those who believe, it strengthens their faith and they rejoice. But for those with a disease in their hearts, it only adds to their doubt, and they die as disbelievers. Do they not see that they are tested once or twice every year? Yet they do not repent or pay attention. Whenever a chapter is revealed, they look at each other and ask, "Does anyone see you?" Then they turn away. God has turned their hearts away because they do not understand. A Messenger has come to you from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should suffer. He is deeply concerned for you and is kind and merciful to the believers. But if they turn away, say: "God is enough for me. There is no god but Him. I trust in Him, and He is the Lord of the Tremendous Throne."

Chapter 10: YUNUS (JONAH)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. These are the verses of the Wise Book. Is it surprising to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves to warn mankind and give good news to the believers that they have a high rank with their Lord? The disbelievers say, "This is a clear sorcerer!" Your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the Throne, regulating all things. No one can intercede with Him except by His permission. This is God, your Lord, so worship Him. Will you not take heed? To Him is your return, all of you. This is a true promise from God. He begins creation and then repeats it to reward those who believe and do good deeds with justice. But those who disbelieve will have a drink of boiling fluids and a painful punishment because they rejected Him. He made the sun a shining light and the moon a reflected light, and determined its phases so you may know the number of years and the reckoning of time. God created this in truth. He explains His signs in detail for those who understand. In the alternation of night and day and in all that God has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for those who fear Him. Those who do not hope to meet Us and are satisfied with the life of this world, and those who are heedless of Our signs...Those who don't expect to meet Us and are content with this worldly life, ignoring Our signs, will have the Fire as their home because of their deeds. But those who believe and do good will be guided by their faith, and rivers will flow beneath them in gardens of bliss. Their prayer will be, "Glory to You, O God!" and their greeting will be "Peace." The end of their prayer will be, "Praise be to God, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!" If God were to hasten the punishment for people as they wish for good, their time would be up. But He lets those who don't hope to meet Him wander blindly in their wrongdoing. When trouble touches a person, they cry out to Us in all postures—lying down, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their trouble, they go on as if they never called to Us. This is how the deeds of transgressors seem fair to them. We destroyed previous generations when they did wrong, even though their messengers came to them with clear signs. This is how We repay those who sin. After them, We made you their successors to see how you would act. When Our clear signs are recited to them, those who don't hope to meet Us say, "Bring a different Quran or change it." Say, "It's not for me to change it on my own. I only follow what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a great day." Say, "If God had willed, I wouldn't have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I lived among you a whole lifetime before this. Don't you understand?" Who does more wrong than someone who invents a lie about God or denies His signs? The guilty will never succeed. They worship things besides God that can't harm or benefit them and say, "These are our intercessors with God." Say, "Are you informing God of something He doesn't know in the heavens or on earth? Glory to Him! He is far above the partners you ascribe to Him." Mankind was once one nation, but they later differed. If it weren't for a word from your Lord, their differences would have been settled. They say, "Why isn't a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "The unseen is only for God to know. Wait, and I will wait with you." When We let people taste mercy after adversity, they plot against Our signs. Say, "God is quicker to plan. Our messengers record all your plots." He enables you to travel by land and sea. When you're on ships sailing with a favorable wind, you rejoice. But when a stormy wind comes and waves surround you, you think you're overwhelmed. You cry out to God sincerely, "If You deliver us from this, we will be grateful." But when He delivers them, they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right. O mankind, your insolence will only harm yourselves. Your defiance is only harming yourselves, providing temporary enjoyment in this life. In the end, you will return to Us, and We will show you the truth of all you did. When He delivers them, they unjustly rebel on earth. O mankind, your rebellion is against your own souls, a fleeting enjoyment of this world. Then you will return to Us, and We will inform you of your deeds. The life of this world is like rain We send from the sky, which mingles with the earth to produce food for people and animals. When the earth is adorned and its people think they control it, Our command comes by night or day, and We make it like a harvested field, as if it had never flourished. This is how We explain Our signs for those who reflect. God calls to the Home of Peace and guides whom He wills to a straight path. Those who do good will have a great reward, and no darkness or shame will cover their faces. They are the companions of the garden, where they will live forever. But those who do evil will receive a similar punishment, and ignominy will cover their faces. They will have no protector from God, and their faces will be as if covered with the darkness of night. They are the companions of the Fire, where they will live forever. On the day We gather them all together, We will say to those who joined partners with Us, "Stand back, you and your partners!" We will separate them, and their partners will say, "It was not us that you worshipped." God is enough as a witness between us and you; we were unaware of your worship of us. Every soul will experience the deeds it sent before, and they will be brought back to God, their rightful Lord, and their invented falsehoods will leave them. Say, "Who sustains you from the sky and the earth? Who controls hearing and sight? Who brings the living from the dead and the dead from the living? Who regulates all affairs?" They will say, "God." Say, "Will you not then show piety to Him?" This is God, your true Lord. After the truth, what remains but error? How then are you turned away? The word of your Lord is proved true against those who rebel; they will not believe. Say, "Can any of your partners originate creation and repeat it?" Say, "It is God who originates creation and repeats it. How are you then deluded away from the truth?" Say, "Can any of your partners guide to the truth?" Say, "It is God who guides to the truth. Is He who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who cannot find the way unless he is guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?" Most of them follow nothing but conjecture, and conjecture can never replace the truth. God is well aware of all they do. This Quran is not something that could be produced by anyone other than God. It is a confirmation of previous revelations and a fuller explanation of the Book, with no doubt in it, from the Lord of the worlds. Or do they say, "He forged it"? Say, "Bring then a sura like it, and call to your... Do they claim that you have made it up? Tell them to produce a chapter like it and call upon anyone they can besides God if they are truthful. They deny what they cannot understand and what has not yet been explained to them. This is similar to how those before them denied the truth. Look at the outcome for those who did wrong. Some of them believe in it, and some do not. Your Lord knows best who are the troublemakers. If they accuse you of lying, say, "My actions are my responsibility, and yours are yours. You are not accountable for what I do, and I am not accountable for what you do." Among them are those who pretend to listen to you, but can you make the deaf hear, even if they do not understand? And among them are those who look at you, but can you guide the blind, even if they do not see? God does not wrong people; it is people who wrong themselves. One day, He will gather them together, and it will seem as if they had only stayed for an hour of a day. They will recognize each other. Those who denied meeting with God and refused guidance will be lost. Whether We show you some of what We promise them or take your soul before that, their return is to Us, and God is a witness to what they do. Every nation had a messenger, and when their messenger came, the matter was judged between them."with justice, and they were not wronged. They ask, 'When will this promise come to pass if you are truthful?' Say, 'I have no power over any harm or benefit to myself except as God wills. Every nation has an appointed time. When their time comes, they cannot delay it nor advance it.' Say, 'Do you see if His punishment comes to you by night or by day? What part of it would the sinners wish to hasten?' When it actually happens, will you believe in it? It will be said, 'Now? And you wanted to hasten it before?' Then it will be said to the wrongdoers, 'Taste the enduring punishment. You get what you earned.' They ask you if it is true. Say, 'Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot escape.' Every soul that has sinned would give everything on earth as ransom. They will feel regret when they see the punishment, but the judgment will be fair, and they will not be wronged. Is it not true that everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God? His promise is assuredly true, but most people do not understand. He gives life and causes death, and to Him, you will be returned. O mankind, there has come to you a direction from your Lord, a healing for the diseases in your hearts, and for those who believe, guidance and mercy. Say, 'In the bounty of God and His mercy, let them rejoice. It is better than what they hoard.' Say, 'Do you see what sustenance God has sent down for you? Yet you hold some things forbidden and some things lawful.' Say, 'Has God indeed permitted you, or do you invent things to attribute to God?' And what do those who invent lies against God think will happen on the Day of Judgment? God is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful. In whatever business you may be, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur'an, and whatever deed you may be doing, We are witnesses when you are deeply engrossed in it. Nothing is hidden from your Lord, not even the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven. Everything is recorded in a clear record. Behold! Truly, on the friends of God, there is no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who believe and constantly guard against evil will have glad tidings in this life and in the Hereafter. There is no changing the words of God. This is indeed the supreme felicity. Let not their speech grieve you, for all power and honor belong to God. He hears and knows all things. Behold! Truly, to God belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth. What do those who worship as His 'partners' other than God follow? They follow nothing but fancy, and they do nothing but lie. He is the One who made the night for you to rest and the day to make things visible. Truly, in this are signs for those who listen to His message. They say, 'God has begotten a son!' Glory be to Him! He is self-sufficient! Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. You have no warrant for this. Do you say about God what you do not know? Say, 'Those who invent a lie against God will never prosper.' They may have a little enjoyment in this world, but then they will return to Us, and We will make them taste the severest penalty for their blasphemies. Relate to them the story of Noah. He said to his people, 'O my people, if it is hard on your mind that I should stay with you and commemorate the signs of God, yet I put my trust in God. Get an agreement about your plan and among your partners, so your plan is not dark and dubious. Then pass your sentence on me and give me no respite.' But if you turn back, consider that I have asked no reward from you. My reward is only due from God, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God's will. They rejected him, but We delivered him and those with him in the Ark, and We made them inherit the earth, while We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. Then see what was the end of those who were warned but did not heed. After him, We sent many messengers to their peoples. They brought them clear signs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our signs. But they were arrogant and were a people in sin. When the truth came to them from Us, they said, 'This is indeed evident sorcery!' Moses said, 'Do you say this about the truth when it has actually reached you? Is sorcery like this? But sorcerers will not prosper.' They said, 'Have you come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following, in order that you and your brother may have greatness in the land? But we shall not believe in you!' Pharaoh said, 'Bring me every skilled magician.' When the magicians arrived, Moses told them, 'Show what you have.' They cast their spells, but Moses declared, 'What you have done is mere sorcery. God will nullify it because He does not support the work of mischief-makers.' God will establish His truth, even if sinners dislike it. Only a few of Moses' people believed in him due to fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, who were oppressive. Moses encouraged his people to trust in God if they truly believed. They responded, 'We trust in God. Our Lord, protect us from the oppressors and save us from the disbelievers.' God instructed Moses and his brother to provide homes for their people in Egypt, make them places of worship, and establish regular prayers. Moses prayed to God, asking Him to destroy Pharaoh's wealth and harden their hearts so they would not believe until they faced severe punishment. God accepted their prayer and advised them to stay on the right path. The Children of Israel crossed the sea, but Pharaoh and his army pursued them. When Pharaoh was drowning, he declared his belief in the God of the Children of Israel. However, it was too late, and God saved his body as a sign for future generations. Despite this, many people remain heedless of God's signs. God settled the Children of Israel in a good place and provided for them, but they fell into disputes after receiving knowledge. God will judge their disagreements on the Day of Judgment. If you doubt what has been revealed, ask those who have read the previous scriptures. The truth has come from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters or rejecters of God's signs, or you will be among the losers. Those who are destined to disbelieve will not believe, even if they see every sign, until they face severe punishment. No community, except the people of Jonah, believed and benefited from their faith. When they believed, God removed the punishment and allowed them to enjoy their lives for a while. If God willed, everyone on earth would believe. But you cannot force people to believe against their will. If your Lord had willed, everyone on earth would have believed. Will you then force people to become believers? No soul can believe except by God's will, and He places doubt on those who do not understand. Say: 'Look at what is in the heavens and the earth.' But signs and warnings do not benefit those who do not believe. Are they waiting for the same fate as those who passed away before them? Say, 'Wait then, I am waiting with you.' Then We save Our messengers and those who believe. It is Our duty to save the believers.""If you are in doubt about my religion, know that I do not worship what you worship besides God. I worship God, who will take your souls at death, and I am commanded to be among the believers. Set your face towards true religion and do not be among the unbelievers. Do not call on anyone other than God, for they can neither benefit nor harm you. If God touches you with harm, no one can remove it but Him. If He intends good for you, no one can withhold His favor. He bestows it on whomever He wills among His servants. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say: 'O people! The truth has come to you from your Lord. Whoever is guided, is guided for their own good, and whoever goes astray, does so to their own loss. I am not a guardian over you.' Follow what is revealed to you and be patient until God decides, for He is the best of judges.

Chapter 11: HUD

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Alif. Lam. Ra. This is a Book with verses that are clear and detailed, from One who is Wise and Well-Acquainted with all things. Worship none but God. I am sent to you from Him to warn and bring good news. Seek forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. He will grant you good and true enjoyment for a term appointed and bestow His grace on those who deserve it. But if you turn away, I fear for you the penalty of a great day. To God is your return, and He has power over all things. They try to hide their hearts from Him, but even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. He knows the secrets of the hearts. There is no creature on earth whose sustenance does not depend on God. He knows its place of rest and its temporary deposit. All is in a clear record. He created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His Throne was over the waters, to test which of you is best in conduct. If you say, 'You will be raised up after death,' the unbelievers will say, 'This is nothing but obvious sorcery!' If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they will say, 'What keeps it back?' On the day it reaches them, nothing will turn it away, and they will be surrounded by what they used to mock at.

When people mock the signs, they will be surrounded by what they used to ridicule. If we give someone a taste of our mercy and then take it away, they fall into despair and ingratitude. But if we give them a taste of our favors after hardship, they boast and become prideful. However, those who are patient and do good deeds will receive forgiveness and a great reward. You might feel inclined to give up part of what has been revealed to you because people question why no treasure or angel has been sent down with you. Remember, you are only a warner, and God is in charge of all things. If they claim you have forged the revelation, challenge them to produce ten chapters like it and call upon anyone they can besides God if they are truthful. If they cannot, know that this revelation is from God, and there is no god but Him. Will you then submit? Those who seek the pleasures of this world will be repaid for their deeds here, but they will have nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. Their efforts will be in vain. On the other hand, those who believe, do good deeds, and humble themselves before their Lord will be the rightful owners of the Garden, where they will dwell forever. The two types of people can be compared to the blind and deaf versus those who can see and hear well. Are they equal? Will you not take heed?

We sent Noah to his people with a clear warning: 'Serve none but God. I fear for you the penalty of a grievous day.' The leaders among his people, who disbelieved, said, 'We see you as nothing but a man like ourselves, and only the lowest among us follow you without thinking. We see no merit in you above us; we think you are liars.' Noah replied, 'O my people! Consider if I have a clear sign from my Lord and He has sent mercy to me, but it is hidden from your sight. Should we force you to accept it when you are unwilling?' Noah said, 'My people, I don't ask you for any wealth in return for my message. My reward is only from God. I won't turn away those who believe; they will meet their Lord, and I see you as ignorant people.' He continued, 'Who will help me against God if I drive them away? Won't you take heed? I don't claim to have God's treasures or knowledge of the unseen, nor do I say I'm an angel. I don't say that those you look down upon won't receive good from God. God knows best what's in their hearts. If I did otherwise, I would be unjust.'

The people responded, 'Noah, you've argued with us for a long time. Bring upon us what you threaten if you're truthful.' Noah replied, 'Only God can bring it upon you if He wills, and you can't escape it. My advice won't benefit you if God wills to leave you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him, you will return.' They accused Noah of forging the message. He said, 'If I have forged it, the sin is on me, and I'm free of your sins.' It was revealed to Noah that none of his people would believe except those who already had. He was told not to grieve over their actions. God instructed him to build an Ark under divine guidance and not to plead for the wrongdoers, as they would be drowned. Noah began constructing the Ark, and whenever the leaders passed by, they mocked him. He said, 'If you mock us now, we can also mock you. Soon you'll know who will face a shameful punishment and lasting doom.'

When the command came, and the earth's fountains gushed forth, Noah was told to take pairs of every species, his family (except those against whom the word had already gone forth), and the believers. Only a few believed with him. Noah said, 'Embark on the Ark in the name of God, whether it moves or rests. My Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.' The Ark sailed amid waves like mountains. Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself, 'O my son! Embark with us and don't be with the unbelievers.' His son replied, 'I'll take refuge on a mountain to save me from the water.' Noah said, 'Today, nothing can save from God's command except those on whom He has mercy.' A wave came between them, and his son was among the drowned. Then it was commanded, 'O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold your rain.' The water receded, the matter was settled, and the Ark rested on Mount Judi. It was said, 'Away with the wrongdoers.'

Noah called upon his Lord, 'O my Lord! My son is of my family, and Your promise is true. You are the Justest of Judges.' God replied, 'O Noah! He is not of your family; his conduct is unrighteous. Don't ask Me about things you have no knowledge of. I advise you not to act like the ignorant.' Noah said, 'O my Lord! I seek refuge in You from asking about things I don't know. If You don't forgive me and show mercy, I will be lost.' Then it was said, 'O Noah! Disembark with peace and blessings from Us upon you and some of the people with you. But there will be other nations whom We will allow to enjoy life for a while, and then a severe punishment will reach them from Us.'

These are stories of the unseen that We reveal to you. Neither you nor your people knew them before this. So be patient, for the end is for those who are righteous. To the people of 'Ad, We sent their brother Hud. He said, 'O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. You are just making things up!' Hud continued, 'O my people! I don't ask for any reward for this message. My reward is from the One who created me. Don't you understand?' 'And O my people! Ask forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. He will send you abundant rain and add strength to your strength. Don't turn away as sinners.' They replied, 'O Hud! You haven't brought us any clear proof, and we won't abandon our gods just because you say so. We don't believe you.' They said, 'We think some of our gods have afflicted you with madness.' Hud responded, 'I call God to witness, and you too bear witness, that I am free from what you associate with Him.' 'Other gods as partners! So plot against me all of you, and give me no respite.' 'I put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature that He doesn't control. My Lord is on a straight path.' 'If you turn away, I have conveyed the message I was sent with. My Lord will replace you with another people, and you can't harm Him at all. My Lord is the Guardian over all things.'

When Our decree came, We saved Hud and those who believed with him by Our mercy. We saved them from a severe punishment. Such were the people of 'Ad. They rejected the signs of their Lord, disobeyed His messengers, and followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor. They were pursued by a curse in this life and on the Day of Judgment. The people of 'Ad rejected their Lord. Away with 'Ad, the people of Hud!

To the people of Thamud, We sent their brother Salih. He said, 'O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. He brought you forth from the earth and settled you in it. So ask forgiveness from Him and turn to Him in repentance. My Lord is near and responsive.' They said, 'O Salih! You were a source of hope for us before this. Do you now forbid us from worshipping what our fathers worshipped? We are in serious doubt about what you are calling us to.' Salih replied, 'O my people! Think about it. If I have clear proof from my Lord and He has granted me mercy, who can help me against God if I disobey Him? You would only add to my loss.' Salih continued, 'O my people! This she-camel is a sign from God for you. Let her graze freely on God's...""Do not harm her, or a swift punishment will come upon you." But they harmed the camel. So Salih warned them, "Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three more days. This is a promise that will not be broken." When Our decree came, We saved Salih and those who believed with him by Our mercy, protecting them from the disgrace of that day. Your Lord is indeed strong and mighty. The wrongdoers were struck by a mighty blast, and they lay lifeless in their homes by morning, as if they had never lived there. The people of Thamud rejected their Lord, and they were removed from sight.

Our messengers brought good news to Abraham. They greeted him with "Peace!" and he responded with "Peace!" and quickly brought them a roasted calf. When he saw they did not eat, he felt uneasy and afraid of them. They reassured him, "Do not fear. We have been sent to the people of Lot." His wife, standing nearby, laughed, and We gave her the good news of Isaac and, after Isaac, Jacob. She exclaimed, "How can I bear a child when I am an old woman and my husband is also old? This is truly amazing!" They replied, "Do you wonder at God's decree? God's mercy and blessings are upon you, O people of the house. He is indeed worthy of all praise and glory."

When Abraham's fear subsided and the good news reached him, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lot. Abraham was indeed forbearing, compassionate, and always turning to God. We said, "O Abraham! Do not plead for them. Your Lord's decree has been issued, and an irreversible punishment is coming to them."

When Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed and felt powerless to protect them. He said, "This is a distressful day." His people rushed towards him, already accustomed to committing abominations. Lot said, "O my people! Here are my daughters; they are purer for you. Fear God and do not disgrace me with my guests. Is there not a single right-minded man among you?" They replied, "You know well that we have no need of your daughters. You know what we want." Lot said, "If only I had the strength to resist you or could rely on some strong support." The messengers said, "O Lot! We are messengers from your Lord. They will not reach you. Leave with your family during the night and do not look back, except for your wife. She will face the same fate as the others. Their appointed time is the morning. Is not the morning near?"

When Our decree came, We turned the cities upside down and rained down on them stones of baked clay, layer upon layer, marked by your Lord. Such punishment is never far from the wrongdoers.

To the people of Midian, We sent their brother Shu'aib. He said, "O my people! Worship God; you have no other god but Him. Do not give short measure or weight. I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will encompass you all around." Shu'aib said, "My people, worship God; you have no other god but Him. Do not cheat in measurements and weights. I see you are prosperous, but I fear a day of punishment that will surround you." He continued, "Give fair measure and weight, and do not withhold what is due to people. Do not commit evil or cause corruption in the land. What remains with God is better for you if you believe. I am not here to watch over you."

The people responded, "Shu'aib, does your prayer command us to abandon what our ancestors worshipped or to stop doing what we want with our property? You are indeed patient and right-minded!" Shu'aib replied, "My people, consider if I have clear evidence from my Lord and He has provided me with good sustenance. I do not wish to do what I forbid you from doing. I only seek to improve things as much as I can. My success comes from God alone. I trust in Him and turn to Him." He warned, "My people, do not let your opposition to me lead you to sin, or you will face a fate similar to the people of Noah, Hud, Salih, or Lot. Ask forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him. My Lord is merciful and loving."

The people said, "Shu'aib, we do not understand much of what you say. We see you as weak among us. If it were not for your family, we would have stoned you, for you have no great position among us." Shu'aib responded, "My people, is my family more important to you than God? You have cast Him aside. My Lord encompasses all that you do. Do whatever you can, and I will do my part. Soon you will know who will face a humiliating punishment and who is a liar. Watch, for I am also watching with you."

When Our decree came, We saved Shu'aib and those who believed with him by Our mercy. The wrongdoers were seized by a mighty blast and lay lifeless in their homes by morning, as if they had never lived there. The people of Midian were removed from sight, just like the people of Thamud.

We sent Moses with Our clear signs and authority to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they followed Pharaoh's command, which was not a right guide. On the Day of Judgment, Pharaoh will lead his people into the Fire. They are followed by a curse in this life and on the Day of Judgment. What a terrible gift they will receive!

These are some of the stories of past communities. Some of them still stand, while others have been destroyed. We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. Their gods, whom they invoked besides God, did not help them when Our decree came. They only added to their ruin. Such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes communities in the midst of their wrongdoing. His punishment is severe and painful.

This is a sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter. That is a day when all mankind will be gathered together, a Day of Testimony. This is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter. It is a day when all people will be gathered together, a day that will be witnessed by all. We will not delay it beyond its appointed time. When that day arrives, no soul will speak except by His permission. Some will be wretched, and others will be blessed.

Those who are wretched will be in the Fire, where they will sigh and sob. They will remain there as long as the heavens and the earth endure, unless your Lord wills otherwise. Your Lord accomplishes what He plans. Those who are blessed will be in the Garden, where they will dwell forever, as long as the heavens and the earth endure, unless your Lord wills otherwise. It is an unfailing gift.

Do not doubt what these people worship. They worship what their ancestors worshipped before them. We will repay them in full without any reduction. We gave the Book to Moses, but there were disputes about it. If it were not for a word from your Lord, the matter would have been settled between them. They are in grave doubt about it. Your Lord will repay everyone in full for their deeds. He knows well what they do.

So, stay on the straight path as you are commanded, along with those who turn to God with you. Do not transgress, for He sees everything you do. Do not incline towards those who do wrong, or the Fire will touch you. You have no protectors other than God, and you will not be helped. Establish regular prayers at both ends of the day and during the night. Good deeds remove evil deeds. This is a reminder for those who remember. Be patient, for God does not let the reward of the righteous perish.

Why were there not, among the generations before you, people with good sense who would forbid mischief on earth? Only a few of those whom We saved did so. The wrongdoers pursued the enjoyment of life and persisted in sin. Your Lord would not destroy communities for a single wrongdoing if its members were likely to mend. If your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind one people, but they will continue to dispute, except those on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy. For this, He created them. The word of your Lord will be fulfilled: "I will fill Hell with jinn and men all together."

All the stories of the messengers that We relate to you are to strengthen your heart. In them, you find the truth, an exhortation, and a reminder for believers. Say to those who do not believe: "Do whatever you can; we will do our part. Wait, and we too shall wait." To God belong the unseen secrets of the heavens and the earth. Every affair returns to Him for decision. Worship Him and put your trust in Him. Your Lord is not unmindful of what you do.

Chapter 12: YUSUF (JOSEPH)
Total Verses: 111
Revealed At: MAKKA

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A.L.R. These are the verses of the clear Book. We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an so that you may understand. We narrate to you the best of stories through Our revelation of this Qur'an, even though before this you were unaware of them.

Joseph said to his father, "O my father, I saw in a dream eleven stars, the sun, and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me." His father replied, "My dear son, do not tell your brothers about your dream, or they will plot against you. Indeed, Satan is a clear enemy to man." He continued, "Thus your Lord will choose you, teach you the interpretation of dreams, and perfect His favor upon you and the descendants of Jacob, just as He perfected it upon your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise."

In the story of Joseph and his brothers, there are signs for those who seek the truth. The brothers said, "Joseph and his brother are more loved by our father than we are, even though we are a strong group. Our father is clearly mistaken." One of them suggested, "Kill Joseph or cast him out to some distant land so that our father's attention will be only on us. After that, we can become righteous people." Another brother said, "Do not kill Joseph. Instead, throw him into the bottom of a well; some travelers will pick him up if you must do something."They said to their father, "O our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his sincere well-wishers. Send him with us tomorrow so he can enjoy himself and play. We will take good care of him." Jacob replied, "It truly saddens me that you should take him away. I fear that a wolf might devour him while you are not paying attention." They said, "If a wolf were to devour him while we are such a large group, then we would indeed be losers."

So they took Joseph away and agreed to throw him into the bottom of the well. We inspired him, "You will surely inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not perceive it." They returned to their father in the evening, weeping. They said, "O our father, we went racing with one another and left Joseph with our things, and the wolf devoured him. But you will not believe us even though we are telling the truth." They brought his shirt stained with false blood. Jacob said, "No, your minds have made up a tale. Patience is most fitting for me. Against what you assert, it is God alone whose help can be sought."

Then a caravan of travelers came by. They sent their water-carrier, who let down his bucket into the well. He exclaimed, "Good news! Here is a young man!" They concealed him as a treasure, but God knew well what they did. They sold him for a low price, a few silver coins, and they did not value him much. The man in Egypt who bought him said to his wife, "Make his stay honorable. Perhaps he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son." Thus, We established Joseph in the land so that We might teach him the interpretation of events. God has full power over His affairs, but most people do not know.

When Joseph reached his full manhood, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus, We reward those who do good. The woman in whose house he was living tried to seduce him. She locked the doors and said, "Come to me." He replied, "God forbid! Truly, your husband is my master and has made my stay agreeable. Indeed, wrongdoers never succeed." She desired him, and he might have desired her if he hadn't seen a sign from his Lord. This was to keep him away from evil and shameful deeds, for he was one of God's sincere servants. They both ran to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back. They found her husband at the door. She said, "What should be the punishment for someone who tried to harm your wife? Prison or a severe punishment?" Joseph said, "It was she who tried to seduce me." A witness from her family testified, "If his shirt is torn from the front, she is telling the truth, and he is lying. But if it is torn from the back, she is lying, and he is telling the truth." When her husband saw that Joseph's shirt was torn from the back, he said, "This is a trick of you women. Your tricks are indeed great. Joseph, ignore this. And you, my wife, ask forgiveness for your sin. You are indeed at fault."

The women in the city gossiped, "The wife of the 'Aziz is trying to seduce her slave. She is deeply in love with him. We see she is clearly going astray." When she heard their gossip, she invited them to a banquet. She gave each of them a knife and said to Joseph, "Come out before them." When they saw him, they were so amazed that they cut their hands and said, "This is not a human being; this is a noble angel!" She said, "This is the man you blamed me for. I tried to seduce him, but he resisted. If he doesn't do what I command, he will be imprisoned and humiliated." Joseph prayed, "My Lord, I prefer prison over what they invite me to. If You don't turn their tricks away from me, I might be inclined towards them and become one of the ignorant." So his Lord answered his prayer and turned their tricks away from him. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

Despite seeing the signs of his innocence, they decided to imprison him for a while. Two young men entered the prison with him. One said, "I dreamed I was pressing wine." The other said, "I dreamed I was carrying bread on my head, and birds were eating from it. Tell us the meaning of these dreams, for we see you are a good person." Joseph said, "I will tell you the meaning before your next meal arrives. This is part of what my Lord has taught me. I have abandoned the ways of people who do not believe in God and deny the Hereafter. I follow the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We never attribute any partners to God. This is God's grace upon us and mankind, but most people are not grateful.

"O my fellow prisoners, are many different lords better, or God, the One, the Supreme? You worship nothing but names you and your ancestors have invented, for which God has sent no authority. The command belongs to God alone. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. This is the right religion, but most people do not understand." Joseph continued, "O my fellow prisoners, as for one of you, he will serve wine to his master. The other will be crucified, and birds will eat from his head. This is the interpretation of your dreams." Joseph then told the one who would be released, "Mention me to your master." But Satan made him forget, and Joseph remained in prison for several more years.

The king of Egypt had a dream of seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean cows, and seven green ears of corn and seven withered ones. He asked his advisors to interpret it, but they couldn't. The man who had been released from prison remembered Joseph and suggested they consult him. The man went to Joseph and asked him to interpret the king's dream. Joseph explained, "You will have seven years of abundant harvests. Store the surplus, because seven years of famine will follow. After that, there will be a year of abundant rain and crops." The king ordered Joseph to be brought to him. When the messenger arrived, Joseph asked him to inquire about the women who had cut their hands, to clear his name. The king questioned the women, and they admitted Joseph's innocence. The wife of the 'Aziz confessed that she had tried to seduce Joseph. Joseph said, "I wanted my master to know I did not betray him in his absence. I do not claim to be perfect, for the human soul is prone to evil unless my Lord bestows His mercy. My Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."

The king then summoned Joseph and appointed him to a high position, recognizing his integrity and wisdom. Joseph requested to be in charge of the storehouses of the land, promising to manage them wisely. Thus, Joseph was given power in Egypt, and he managed the resources as he saw fit. God's mercy was upon him, and He does not let the reward of the righteous go to waste. The reward of the Hereafter is even better for those who believe and are righteous.

Joseph's brothers came to him, but they didn't recognize him, though he knew them. After providing them with provisions, Joseph asked them to bring their younger brother next time, promising full measure and the best hospitality. He warned that if they didn't bring their brother, they wouldn't receive any more provisions. The brothers agreed to try to convince their father to let their younger brother come with them. Joseph secretly instructed his servants to return their payment in their bags, hoping they would come back. When the brothers returned home, they told their father about the situation and found their payment returned. They asked their father to send their younger brother with them, promising to take good care of him. Their father, Jacob, was hesitant, recalling how he had lost Joseph before. He finally agreed, making them swear by God to bring their brother back unless they were overpowered. Jacob advised his sons to enter the city through different gates, acknowledging that only God's will prevails. When they followed his advice, it didn't change God's plan, but it satisfied Jacob's concern. Jacob had knowledge given by God, though most people didn't understand.

When the brothers returned to Joseph, he revealed his identity to his full brother and reassured him. Joseph then devised a plan to keep his brother with him by placing a royal cup in his brother's bag. When the cup was discovered, the brothers were accused of theft. They protested their innocence, but the penalty for the theft was that the person in whose bag the cup was found would become a bondman. Joseph began searching their bags, starting with the others before his brother's. He found the cup in his brother's bag, which was part of God's plan to keep his brother with him. Joseph couldn't have taken his brother under the king's law unless God willed it. God elevates whom He pleases, and above everyone with knowledge is the All-Knowing.

The brothers said, "If he steals, his brother stole before." Joseph kept this to himself and didn't reveal it to them, thinking, "You are in a worse situation, and God knows best the truth of what you claim." They pleaded, "O ruler, he has an elderly father who will grieve for him. Take one of us instead, for we see you are kind." Joseph replied, "God forbid that we take anyone other than the one with whom we found our property; otherwise, we would be unjust." When they saw no hope, they privately conferred. The eldest said, "Remember how our father made us swear by God and how we failed with Joseph before? I will not leave this land until my father permits or God decides for me. He is the best judge." They returned to their father and said, "O our father, your son committed theft. We testify only to what we know and couldn't guard against the unseen.""Ask the town where we were and the caravan we traveled with; we are telling the truth." Jacob said, "No, your minds have made up a story. Patience is best for me. Maybe God will bring them all back to me. He is the All-Knowing, the Wise." He turned away and said, "How great is my grief for Joseph!" His eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy. The brothers said, "By God, you will never stop remembering Joseph until you are severely ill or dead!" Jacob replied, "I only complain of my distraction and anguish to God, and I know from God what you do not know. O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope in God's mercy. Only those who have no faith despair of God's mercy."

When they returned to Joseph, they said, "O exalted one, distress has seized us and our family. We have brought scanty capital, so please give us full measure and treat it as charity. God rewards the charitable." Joseph asked, "Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?" They replied, "Are you indeed Joseph?" He said, "I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us. Whoever is righteous and patient, God will not let their reward be lost." They said, "By God, indeed God has preferred you above us, and we were guilty of sin." Joseph said, "No reproach on you today. May God forgive you; He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. Take my shirt and cast it over my father's face; he will regain his sight. Then bring your whole family to me."

When the caravan left Egypt, their father said, "I sense the presence of Joseph. Don't think me a dotard." They replied, "By God, you are still in your old delusion." When the bearer of good news arrived, he placed the shirt on Jacob's face, and Jacob's sight was restored. Jacob said, "Didn't I tell you that I know from God what you do not?" The brothers then said, "Father, ask God to forgive our sins; we were truly wrong." Jacob responded, "I will soon ask my Lord for forgiveness for you. He is indeed the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful."

When they entered Joseph's presence, he welcomed his parents and said, "Enter Egypt in safety, if God wills." Joseph then raised his parents to a high place of honor, and they all bowed down before him. He said, "Father, this is the fulfillment of my earlier vision. God has made it come true. He was kind to me when He freed me from prison and brought you all here from the desert, even after Satan caused conflict between me and my brothers. My Lord understands best and is full of knowledge and wisdom." Joseph prayed, "My Lord, You have given me some power and taught me the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Let me die as one who submits to Your will and join me with the righteous."

This is one of the stories of the unseen that We reveal to you, Muhammad. You were not present when they plotted together. Even though you desire it, most people will not believe. You do not ask them for any reward for this message; it is a reminder for all humanity. How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by, yet they turn away from them? Most of them do not believe in God without associating others with Him. Do they feel secure from the coming of God's punishment or the sudden arrival of the Hour while they are unaware? Say, "This is my way: I call to God with clear evidence, I and those who follow me. Glory to God! I am not one of the polytheists."

We sent messengers before you, Muhammad, who were men living in human habitations. Have they not traveled through the earth and seen the end of those before them? The home of the Hereafter is best for those who do right. Will you not then understand? When the messengers despaired and thought they were denied, Our help reached them, and those We willed were delivered. Our punishment cannot be averted from the guilty. In their stories, there is a lesson for people of understanding. It is not an invented tale but a confirmation of what came before, a detailed explanation of everything, and a guide and mercy for those who believe.

Chapter 13: The Thunder

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A.L.M.R. These are the verses of the Book. What has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe. God is the One who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see and is firmly established on the throne of authority. He has subjected the sun and the moon to His law; each runs its course for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs. God is the one who spread out the earth and placed mountains and rivers on it. He created all kinds of fruits in pairs and covers the night with the day. These are signs for those who reflect. On earth, there are different regions, gardens of vines, fields of corn, and palm trees, some growing from a single root and others from separate roots. They are all watered with the same water, yet some are made better than others to eat. These are signs for those who understand.

If you are amazed, then their statement is truly strange: "When we are dust, will we be created anew?" These are the ones who deny their Lord, and they will have chains around their necks and be the companions of the Fire, where they will remain forever. They ask you to hasten the punishment rather than the good, even though there have been many exemplary punishments before them. But your Lord is full of forgiveness for humanity despite their wrongdoing, and He is also strict in punishment. The disbelievers say, "Why hasn't a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" You are only a warner, and there is a guide for every people. God knows what every female bears and what the wombs fall short of or exceed. Everything is measured with Him. He knows the unseen and the seen; He is the Great, the Most High. It is the same to Him whether you conceal your speech or declare it openly, whether you hide by night or walk freely by day. For each person, there are angels in succession, guarding them by God's command. God does not change a people's condition unless they change what is in their hearts. When God wills a people's punishment, there is no turning it back, and they will find no protector besides Him.

He shows you the lightning, causing fear and hope, and raises the heavy clouds. The thunder praises Him, and so do the angels out of awe. He sends the thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He wills, yet they dispute about God, and He is mighty in power. To Him alone is the true prayer. Those they call upon besides Him do not respond to them at all, like someone stretching out their hands to water that never reaches their mouth. The prayer of disbelievers goes astray. Whatever beings are in the heavens and the earth prostrate themselves to God, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the morning and evening.

Say, "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "It is God." Say, "Do you then take protectors other than Him, who have no power either for good or harm to themselves?" Say, "Are the blind equal to those who see? Or is darkness equal to light?" Or do they assign partners to God who have created anything like His creation, so that the creation seemed similar to them? Say, "God is the Creator of all things; He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible." God is the Creator of everything and the Almighty. Say: Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: God. Do you take protectors other than Him, who have no power to benefit or harm themselves? Are the blind and the seeing alike? Can darkness and light be equal? Or do they assign partners to God who have created anything like His creation, making it seem similar to them? Say: God is the Creator of all things, and He is the Supreme and Irresistible.

He sends down water from the sky, and the channels flow according to their measure. The torrent carries foam on its surface, just like the scum that rises from what they melt in the fire to make ornaments or tools. This is how God shows the difference between truth and falsehood. The scum disappears, but what benefits people remains on the earth. This is how God sets forth parables. For those who respond to their Lord, there are good things. But for those who do not respond, even if they had all that is in the heavens and the earth, they would offer it as a ransom. They will face a terrible reckoning, and their abode will be Hell, a miserable place.

Is the one who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth like the one who is blind? Only those with understanding will take heed. Those who fulfill God's covenant and do not break their promises, who join what God has commanded to be joined, and who fear their Lord and the terrible reckoning, will be rewarded. Those who patiently persevere, seeking their Lord's pleasure, establish regular prayers, spend from what We have provided them, both secretly and openly, and repel evil with good, will have the final attainment of the eternal home. They will enter gardens of perpetual bliss, along with the righteous among their parents, spouses, and offspring. Angels will enter upon them from every gate, saying: "Peace be upon you for your patience! How excellent is the final home!" But those who break God's covenant after confirming it, sever what God has commanded to be joined, and cause mischief on the earth, will face a curse and a terrible home.

God enlarges or restricts sustenance for whom He pleases. They rejoice in the life of this world, but the life of this world is nothing compared to the Hereafter, which is only temporary enjoyment. The disbelievers say: "Why hasn't a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "God leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself those who turn to Him in repentance.""Those who believe and find peace in remembering God, for surely, hearts find peace in His remembrance. For those who believe and do good deeds, there is every blessing and a beautiful place to return to. We have sent you among people before whom other nations have passed away, so you may recite to them what We have revealed to you. Yet, they deny the Most Gracious. Say: 'He is my Lord; there is no god but He. On Him, I trust, and to Him, I turn.' If there were a Qur'an that could move mountains, split the earth, or make the dead speak, it would be this one. But the command is with God in all things. Don't the believers know that if God willed, He could have guided all mankind? But the disbelievers will continue to face disasters for their deeds, or disasters will settle close to their homes, until God's promise comes to pass. God will not fail in His promise.

Disasters will continue to strike those who disbelieve because of their actions, or they will occur near their homes until God's promise is fulfilled. God never fails to keep His promise. Even if there were a Qur'an that could move mountains, split the earth, or make the dead speak, the command is entirely with God. Don't the believers know that if God willed, He could guide all people? But the disbelievers will keep facing calamities for their deeds until God's promise comes true. God never fails in His promise. Many messengers before you were mocked, but I gave the disbelievers time before punishing them. How terrible was My punishment! God watches over every soul and knows all their actions. Yet, they assign partners to God. Say: 'Name them! Are you informing Him of something He doesn't know on earth, or is it just empty words?' Their false beliefs seem pleasing to them, but they are kept from the right path. Those whom God leaves astray have no guide. For them, there is punishment in this world, but the punishment of the Hereafter is even worse, and they have no protector against God.

The parable of the Garden promised to the righteous: beneath it flow rivers, and its enjoyment and shade are perpetual. This is the reward for those who are righteous, while the reward for disbelievers is the Fire. Those who received the Book rejoice in what has been revealed to you, but some among the clans reject parts of it. Say: 'I am commanded to worship God and not to associate anything with Him. To Him, I call, and to Him is my return.' We have revealed it as a decisive judgment in Arabic. If you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you will have no protector or defender against God. We sent messengers before you and gave them wives and children. No messenger could bring a sign except by God's permission. For every period, there is a Book revealed. God blots out or confirms what He pleases, and with Him is the source of all decrees. Whether We show you part of what We promise them or take your soul before it happens, your duty is to convey the message, and it is Our part to call them to account.

Don't they see that We gradually reduce the land from its outlying borders? When God commands, no one can put back His command, and He is swift in calling to account. Those before them also devised plots, but all planning is God's. He knows what every soul earns, and soon the disbelievers will know who gets the final home. The disbelievers say: 'You are not a messenger.' Say: 'God is sufficient as a witness between me and you, and so are those who have knowledge of the Book.'

Chapter 14: IBRAHIM (ABRAHAM)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A. L. R. This is a Book We have revealed to you so that you may lead mankind out of darkness into light, by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the Mighty, the Praised One. God, to whom belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. Woe to the disbelievers for a terrible punishment. Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, who hinder others from the path of God and seek to make it crooked, are far astray.

People who love this world more than the afterlife and turn others away from God's path are deeply misguided. We sent messengers to speak the language of their people to make the message clear. God guides or leads astray whom He wills, and He is all-powerful and wise. We sent Moses with our signs, telling him to lead his people from darkness into light and remind them of God's days. There are signs in this for those who are patient and grateful. Moses told his people to remember God's favor when He saved them from Pharaoh's torment, where their sons were killed, and their women were spared. This was a great trial from God. God proclaimed that if you are grateful, He will give you more, but if you are ungrateful, His punishment is severe. Moses said that even if everyone on earth is ungrateful, God is self-sufficient and praiseworthy.

Have you heard the stories of those before you, like the people of Noah, 'Ad, and Thamud? Their messengers came with clear signs, but they rejected them and doubted their message. The messengers asked if there could be any doubt about God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He invites you to forgive your sins and give you respite. The people replied that the messengers were just humans like them and demanded clear authority. The messengers said they were indeed human but that God grants His grace to whom He pleases. They could not bring any authority except by God's permission, and believers should trust in God. The messengers said they had no reason not to trust in God, who guided them. They would endure the harm caused by others and put their trust in God.

The disbelievers threatened to drive the messengers out of their land unless they returned to their old religion. God revealed to the messengers that He would destroy the wrongdoers and make the believers inherit the land. This promise is for those who fear standing before God and His punishment. The disbelievers sought victory, but every arrogant transgressor was frustrated. Hell awaits them, and they will be given boiling, fetid water to drink, which they will sip but cannot swallow. Death will come from every side, but they will not die, and severe punishment awaits them. The actions of those who reject their Lord are like ashes blown away by the wind on a stormy day. They have no control over what they have earned, and this is a great error.

Do you not see that God created the heavens and the earth with purpose? If He wills, He can remove you and bring forth a new creation. This is not difficult for God. On the Day of Judgment, everyone will be gathered before God. The weak will say to the arrogant, 'We followed you; can you help us against God's wrath?' The arrogant will reply, 'If God had guided us, we would have guided you. Now, it makes no difference whether we are patient or impatient; there is no escape for us.' Satan will say, 'God promised you the truth, and I promised you but failed. I had no power over you except to call you, and you responded. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I reject your previous act of associating me with God. Wrongdoers will face a severe punishment.'

But those who believe and do good deeds will enter gardens with rivers flowing beneath, where they will stay forever with their Lord's permission. Their greeting will be 'Peace.' God sets forth a parable: A good word is like a good tree, firmly rooted, with branches reaching the sky, yielding fruit in every season by God's permission. This parable is meant for people to reflect. Conversely, an evil word is like a bad tree, uprooted from the earth, with no stability. God will strengthen those who believe with a firm word in this world and the Hereafter, but He will lead wrongdoers astray. God does what He wills.

Have you seen those who exchanged God's favor for ingratitude and led their people to ruin? They will end up in Hell, a terrible place to stay. They set up idols as equals to God to mislead people. Say, 'Enjoy your brief power, for your journey's end will be the Fire.' Tell my servants who believe to establish regular prayers and spend in charity, secretly and openly, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining or friendship. God created the heavens and the earth, sends down rain to produce fruits for you, and made ships and rivers subject to you. He made the sun and the moon, night and day, to serve you. He gives you everything you ask for. If you tried to count God's favors, you could not. Yet, humans are often unjust and ungrateful.

Remember when Abraham said, 'O my Lord, make this city safe and keep me and my sons from worshipping idols. They have led many people astray. Whoever follows me is of me, and whoever disobeys me, You are Forgiving and Merciful. O our Lord, I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley near Your Sacred House so they may establish prayer. Fill the hearts of people with love for them and provide them with fruits so they may be grateful.' O our Lord! I have settled some of my descendants in a barren valley near Your Sacred House so they may establish prayer. Make some people's hearts inclined towards them and provide them with fruits so they may be grateful. O our Lord! You know what we conceal and what we reveal; nothing is hidden from You, whether on earth or in heaven. Praise be to God, Who has granted me Ishmael and Isaac in my old age. Truly, my Lord is the Hearer of Prayer. O my Lord! Make me and my descendants regular in prayer, and accept my prayer. O our Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and all believers on the Day of Judgment. Do not think that God is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only gives them respite until a day when eyes will stare in horror."On that Day, people will rush forward with their heads raised, their gaze fixed, and their hearts empty. Warn them of the Day when punishment will come upon them, and the wrongdoers will plead, 'Our Lord! Give us a little more time; we will answer Your call and follow the messengers.' But it will be said to them, 'Did you not swear before that you would not face any decline?' You lived in the homes of those who wronged themselves, and it was clear how We dealt with them, making them examples for you. They plotted their schemes, but their plots are known to God, even if they could move mountains. Do not think that God will fail to keep His promise to His messengers. God is Mighty and capable of retribution. On the Day when the earth and heavens will be changed, everyone will be brought before God, the One, the Irresistible. You will see the sinners bound together in chains, their garments made of liquid pitch, and their faces covered with fire. This is so God may repay each soul according to its deeds. God is swift in reckoning. This is a clear message for mankind so they may be warned and know that He is the One God, and people of understanding may take heed.

Chapter 15: AL-HIJR (The Rocky Tract)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. A.L.R. These are the verses of the Qur'an, a clear Book. The disbelievers will wish they had submitted to God. Let them enjoy and be deceived by false hope; they will soon know. We never destroyed a population without a set term. No nation can advance or delay its term. They say, 'O you to whom the Reminder is revealed, you are surely insane. Why don't you bring angels to us if you are truthful?' We do not send angels except with the truth, and then the disbelievers would not be given respite. We have sent down the Reminder, and We will surely guard it from corruption. We sent messengers before you among the previous communities, but no messenger came to them without being mocked. Thus, We let disbelief enter the hearts of the sinners. They wouldn't believe in the message, even though the examples of past people have already passed. Even if We opened a gate to heaven for them and they kept ascending through it, they would say, 'Our eyes are deceived; we are bewitched.' We have set the zodiac signs in the heavens and made them beautiful for all to see. We have also guarded them from every cursed devil. If any devil tries to listen stealthily, a bright flaming fire pursues them. We spread out the earth, set firm mountains on it, and produced everything in balanced measure. We provided means of sustenance for you and for those you do not support. Everything has its treasures with Us, and We send it down in measured amounts. We send the fertilizing winds and cause rain to descend, providing you with water, though you do not store it. It is We who give life and death, and We are the inheritors. We know those who hasten forward and those who lag behind. Your Lord will gather them together; He is Wise and Knowing. We created man from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape. Before that, We created the jinn from scorching fire. When your Lord said to the angels, 'I am about to create a human from clay,' and when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down in prostration to him. The angels prostrated, all except Iblis, who refused. God said, 'O Iblis, what is your reason for not being among those who prostrated?' Iblis replied, 'I am not one to prostrate to a human You created from clay.' God said, 'Then get out from here, for you are rejected and accursed until the Day of Judgment.' Iblis asked for respite until the Day of Resurrection, and God granted it. Iblis said, 'Because You have put me in the wrong, I will make wrong seem fair to them on earth and mislead them all, except Your sincere servants.' God said, 'This is a straight path to Me. You have no authority over My servants except those who follow you.' Hell is the promised place for them all, with seven gates, each assigned to a class of sinners. The righteous will be in gardens and fountains, greeted with peace and security. We will remove any sense of injury from their hearts, and they will be like brothers, joyfully facing each other on thrones. They will not feel fatigue nor be asked to leave. Tell My servants that I am indeed the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. But also let them know that My punishment is severe.

Share with them the story of Abraham's guests. When they entered his presence and greeted him with 'Peace,' he felt uneasy. They reassured him, saying, 'Don't be afraid! We bring you good news of a wise son.' Abraham questioned how this could be, given his old age. They confirmed the news, urging him not to despair. Abraham responded, 'Who despairs of their Lord's mercy except those who are lost?' Abraham then asked the messengers about their mission. They replied, 'We are sent to a sinful people, except for Lot's followers, whom we will save, except his wife, who will remain behind.' When the messengers arrived at Lot's place, he recognized them as strangers. They informed him of their mission and instructed him to leave with his family during the night, without looking back. They revealed that the sinners would be destroyed by morning. The people of the city, excited by the arrival of the guests, approached Lot. He pleaded with them not to disgrace him and to fear God. They reminded him of their previous warnings. Lot offered his daughters to them instead, but they were blinded by their desires. By morning, a mighty blast overtook them, and their cities were turned upside down, raining down stones of baked clay. These events serve as signs for those who understand and believe. The cities were on a well-known route, and the people of the wood and the rocky tract also faced retribution for their wrongdoings. Despite receiving Our signs, they turned away, feeling secure in their mountain homes. But a mighty blast seized them in the morning, and their efforts were in vain. We created the heavens and the earth with purpose, and the Hour is coming. So, forgive with graciousness. Your Lord is the All-Wise Creator, and We have given you the Seven Oft-Repeated Verses and the Grand Qur'an. Do not envy what We have given others, and be kind to the believers. Declare that you are a clear warner, just as We sent down warnings to those who divided the Scripture. Those who have made the Qur'an into shreds (as they please). By the Lord, We will surely call them to account for all their deeds. So, proclaim what you are commanded and turn away from those who join false gods with God. We will defend you against the scoffers who adopt another god besides God. They will soon come to know. We know how distressed you are by what they say. But celebrate the praises of your Lord and be among those who prostrate themselves in adoration. Serve your Lord until the Hour that is certain comes to you.

Chapter 16: AN-NAHL (THE BEE)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. The command of God is coming, so do not seek to hasten it. Glory to Him, and He is far above having the partners they ascribe to Him! He sends down His angels with inspiration to His servants, saying, 'Warn mankind that there is no god but Me, so fulfill your duty to Me.' He created the heavens and the earth with truth. He is exalted above all that they associate with Him. He created man from a drop of fluid, yet man becomes an open opponent. He created cattle for you, providing warmth, benefits, and food. You find beauty in them when you bring them home and when you take them out to pasture. They carry your heavy loads to lands you could not reach without great trouble. Your Lord is Kind and Merciful. He created horses, mules, and donkeys for you to ride and as adornment. He creates what you do not know.God has provided you with homes for rest and comfort, and made tents from animal skins that are easy to carry when you travel. He has also given you wool, fur, and hair from animals to make useful items. God created shelters for you from the sun, places of refuge in the mountains, and garments to protect you from heat and harm. He completes His favors upon you so that you may submit to His will. If people turn away, your duty is only to deliver the clear message.They acknowledge God's blessings but deny them, and most of them are ungrateful. On the Day of Judgment, a witness will be raised from every nation, and no excuses will be accepted from disbelievers. When wrongdoers see the penalty, it will not be reduced, nor will they be given any respite. Those who associated partners with God will see their false gods and realize they were deceived. On that day, they will submit to God, and all their fabrications will fail them. For those who reject God and hinder others from His path, the penalty will be increased because they spread corruption. On that day, a witness will be raised from every nation, and you (Muhammad) will be a witness against your people. The Book has been revealed to you as a guide, mercy, and good news for those who submit.

God commands justice, doing good, and giving to relatives. He forbids shameful deeds, injustice, and rebellion. He instructs you so that you may take heed. Fulfill the covenant of God and do not break your oaths after confirming them. Do not be like a woman who unravels her yarn after it has become strong. Do not use your oaths to deceive each other, as God will test you by this and make clear to you on the Day of Judgment what you disagreed about. If God willed, He could make you all one people, but He guides whom He pleases and leaves astray whom He pleases. You will be called to account for all your actions. Do not use your oaths to deceive each other, causing someone's foot to slip after it was firmly planted, and tasting the evil consequences of hindering others from God's path. Do not sell God's covenant for a small price, as what is with God is far better for you if you only knew. What you have will fade away, but what God has will last forever. We will reward those who are patient with the best of their deeds. Whoever does good, whether man or woman, and believes, will be given a good life and rewarded according to their best actions.

When you read the Qur'an, seek protection from Satan. He has no power over those who believe and trust in their Lord. His influence is only over those who follow him and associate others with God. When we replace one revelation with another, people say you are making it up, but most of them do not understand. Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from your Lord to strengthen the believers and as guidance and good news for those who submit. They say a man teaches him, but the language of the one they refer to is foreign, while this is clear Arabic. Those who do not believe in God's signs will not be guided and will face a severe penalty. Only those who do not believe in God's revelations invent lies. Anyone who disbelieves after believing, except under compulsion while their heart remains firm in faith, will face God's wrath and a dreadful penalty. This is because they prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter, and God does not guide those who reject faith. God has sealed their hearts, ears, and eyes, and they are heedless. In the Hereafter, they will be the losers. But for those who leave their homes after trials and persecutions, and strive and fight for their faith with patience, God is Forgiving and Merciful.

On the Day of Judgment, every soul will plead for itself and be fully recompensed for its actions without injustice. God gives the example of a city that was secure and well-provided but became ungrateful, so it faced hunger and fear because of its actions. A messenger came to them, but they rejected him, so they were punished for their wrongdoing. Eat of the lawful and good sustenance God has provided and be grateful if you truly serve Him. God has only forbidden dead meat, blood, swine flesh, and anything over which other names than God's have been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience, God is Forgiving and Merciful. Do not falsely declare things as lawful or forbidden to invent lies against God. Those who do so will never prosper. Those who lie against God will not succeed. They may enjoy a brief benefit, but they will face severe punishment. We prohibited certain things for the Jews, as previously mentioned. We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. However, your Lord is forgiving and merciful to those who do wrong out of ignorance and then repent and make amends.

Abraham was a model of obedience to God, true in faith, and did not associate others with God. He was grateful for God's favors, and God chose and guided him on the right path. We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. We have inspired you, Muhammad, to follow the faith of Abraham, who was upright and not an idolater. The Sabbath was made strict for those who disagreed about its observance, and God will judge their differences on the Day of Judgment. Invite people to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good preaching, and argue with them in the best manner. Your Lord knows best who has strayed and who is guided. If you retaliate, do so in proportion to the wrong done to you. But if you are patient, it is better for those who are patient. Be patient, for your patience is from God. Do not grieve over them or be distressed by their plots. God is with those who restrain themselves and do good.

Glory to God, who took His servant on a night journey from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him some of Our signs. He is the Hearer and Seer. We gave Moses the Book and made it a guide for the Children of Israel, commanding them not to take any protector besides God. They are the descendants of those We carried with Noah, who was a grateful servant. We warned the Children of Israel in the Book that they would cause mischief on earth twice and be arrogant. When the first warning came to pass, We sent against them servants of Ours with great might, who ravaged their land. When the second warning came, We allowed their enemies to disfigure their faces and enter their Temple, destroying everything they conquered. If you do good, it is for your own benefit; if you do evil, it is against yourselves. If you return to disobedience, We will return to punishment, and We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.

This Qur'an guides to what is most right and gives glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds, promising them a magnificent reward. This guidance leads to what is most upright and brings good news to believers who do good deeds, promising them a great reward. For those who do not believe in the Hereafter, we have prepared a severe punishment. People often pray for things that are harmful as they pray for good, because humans are hasty by nature. We have made the night and the day as two signs: the night is dark, and the day is bright, so you can seek bounty from your Lord and know the count of years and the reckoning. We have explained everything in detail. Every person's fate is tied to their own actions. On the Day of Judgment, we will present a scroll that they will see spread open. It will be said, "Read your record; today, your own soul is enough to account against you." Whoever receives guidance does so for their own benefit, and whoever goes astray does so to their own loss. No one can bear another's burden, and we do not punish until we have sent a messenger to give warning.

When we decide to destroy a population, we first send a clear command to those who live comfortably but transgress, proving the word true against them, and then we destroy them completely. We have destroyed many generations after Noah, and your Lord is fully aware of the sins of His servants. If anyone desires the fleeting things of this life, we readily grant them as we will, but in the end, we have prepared Hell for them, where they will burn, disgraced and rejected. Those who desire the Hereafter and strive for it with true effort, while having faith, will have their striving accepted. We bestow the bounties of your Lord freely on all, both those who seek this world and those who seek the Hereafter. The bounties of your Lord are not limited. See how we have favored some over others, but the Hereafter is greater in rank and excellence. Do not set up any other god besides God, or you will sit in disgrace and destitution.

Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him and be kind to your parents. If one or both of them reach old age with you, do not say a word of contempt to them or repel them, but speak to them with honor. Lower to them the wing of humility out of kindness and say, "My Lord, have mercy on them as they cherished me in childhood." Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts. If you do righteous deeds, He is most forgiving to those who turn to Him in repentance. Give your relatives their due rights, as well as to those in need and the wayfarer, but do not squander your wealth wastefully. Spendthrifts are brothers of the devils, and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord. If you must turn away from them in pursuit of mercy from your Lord, which you expect, still speak to them with gentle words. Do not be miserly, nor be overly generous, lest you become blameworthy and destitute. Your Lord provides sustenance in abundance for whom He pleases and in just measure. He knows and regards all His servants.Give full measure and weigh with a true balance; this is fair and better in the end. Do not pursue things you have no knowledge of, as you will be questioned about your hearing, sight, and heart. Do not walk arrogantly on the earth; you cannot break the earth or reach the mountains in height. All such behavior is hateful in the sight of your Lord. These are wise teachings revealed by your Lord. Do not associate any other god with God, or you will be thrown into Hell, disgraced and abandoned. Has your Lord chosen sons for you and daughters for Himself from among the angels? This is a grievous statement. We have explained things in various ways in this Qur'an so that people may take heed, but it only increases their aversion. Say: If there were other gods besides Him, they would have sought a way to the Lord of the Throne. Glory to Him! He is exalted above what they say. The seven heavens and the earth and all beings therein declare His glory, but you do not understand their praise. He is ever Forbearing, Most Forgiving. When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden barrier between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter. We cover their hearts and ears so they do not understand it. When you mention your Lord alone in the Qur'an, they turn their backs in aversion. We know best why they listen to you and what they say in private. The wicked say, 'You follow only a man bewitched.' See what comparisons they make for you, but they are astray and cannot find the way. They say, 'When we are reduced to bones and dust, will we really be raised up as a new creation?' Say: 'Be stones or iron, or any other created matter that you think is harder to be raised up.' They will ask, 'Who will bring us back?' Say: 'He who created you first.' They will shake their heads and ask, 'When will that be?' Say: 'It may be soon.' On the Day when He calls you, you will respond with His praise, and you will think you only stayed a little while. Tell My servants to speak kindly to each other, as Satan sows discord among them. Satan is a clear enemy to humanity. Your Lord knows you best: if He wills, He grants mercy; if He wills, He punishes. You are not sent to control their affairs. Your Lord knows best all beings in the heavens and on earth. We have given some prophets more gifts than others, and to David, We gave the Psalms. Say: "Call on those you think can help besides Him; they have no power to remove your troubles or change them." Those whom they call upon seek ways to get closer to their Lord, hoping for His mercy and fearing His wrath. The wrath of your Lord is something to be cautious of. There is no population that We will not destroy or punish before the Day of Judgment; this is written in the eternal record. We refrain from sending signs because previous generations treated them as false. We sent the she-camel to the Thamud as a clear sign, but they wronged her. We only send signs to instill fear. Your Lord encompasses mankind. The vision We showed you is a trial for people, as is the cursed tree mentioned in the Qur'an. We warn them, but it only increases their transgression. When We told the angels to bow down to Adam, they all did except Iblis. He said, "Shall I bow to one created from clay?" Iblis said, "If you give me respite until the Day of Judgment, I will mislead his descendants, except a few." God said, "Go, and whoever follows you, Hell will be their recompense." Lead astray those you can with your voice, assault them with your forces, share in their wealth and children, and make promises to them. But Satan's promises are only deceit. As for My servants, you have no authority over them. Your Lord is sufficient as a protector. Your Lord makes the ship go smoothly for you on the sea so you may seek His bounty. He is most merciful. When distress seizes you at sea, those you call upon besides Him leave you, but when He brings you back to land safely, you turn away. Man is ever ungrateful. Do you feel secure that He will not cause the land to swallow you or send a violent tornado against you? Or that He will not send you back to sea and drown you because of your ingratitude? We have honored the children of Adam, provided them with transport on land and sea, given them good and pure sustenance, and conferred on them special favors above many of Our creations. One day, We will call all human beings with their records. Those given their record in their right hand will read it with pleasure and will not be wronged in the least. On that day, everyone will be called with their leader. Those who receive their record in their right hand will read it with joy and will not be wronged at all. But those who were blind in this world will be blind in the hereafter and even more astray from the path. They tried to tempt you away from what We revealed to you, to make you invent something else in Our name. If We had not given you strength, you might have inclined towards them a little. In that case, We would have made you taste double punishment in this life and after death, and you would have found no helper against Us. They wanted to scare you off the land to expel you, but they would not have stayed there long after you. This has been Our way with the messengers We sent before you, and you will find no change in Our ways. Establish regular prayers from the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night, and the morning prayer and reading, for the morning prayer and reading are witnessed. Pray during the night as an additional prayer for you; perhaps your Lord will raise you to a station of praise and glory. Say, 'O my Lord! Let my entry be by the gate of truth and honor, and likewise my exit by the gate of truth and honor; and grant me from Your presence an authority to aid me.' And say, 'Truth has arrived, and falsehood has perished, for falsehood is bound to perish.' We send down in the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, but it causes nothing but loss to the unjust. When We bestow Our favors on man, he turns away and becomes remote, but when evil seizes him, he gives himself up to despair. Say, 'Everyone acts according to their own disposition, but your Lord knows best who is best guided on the way.' They ask you about the Spirit. Say, 'The Spirit comes by the command of my Lord, and of knowledge, you have been given only a little.' If We willed, We could take away what We have revealed to you, and you would find no guardian against Us in that matter, except for mercy from your Lord. His bounty to you is indeed great. Say, 'If all of mankind and jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped each other.' We have explained to man in this Qur'an every kind of similitude, yet most men refuse to believe except with ingratitude. They say, 'We will not believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us, or until you have a garden of date trees and vines and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst, carrying abundant water, or until you cause the sky to fall in pieces as you say will happen, or bring God and the angels before us face to face, or you have a house adorned with gold, or you mount a ladder right into the skies. No, we shall not even believe in your mounting until you send down to us a book that we can read.' Say, 'Glory to my Lord! Am I anything but a man, a messenger?' People questioned, "Has God sent a human like us as His messenger?" Say, "If there were angels living on earth, We would have sent an angel as a messenger." God is enough as a witness between me and you. He knows and sees everything about His servants. Those whom God guides are truly guided, but those He leaves astray will have no protector. On Judgment Day, they will be gathered blind, mute, and deaf, and their home will be Hell. Whenever the fire lessens, We will increase its intensity. This is their punishment for rejecting Our signs and doubting resurrection after becoming bones and dust. Don't they see that the One who created the heavens and the earth can recreate them? Yet, the unjust refuse to believe. Say, "If you controlled the treasures of God's mercy, you would withhold them out of fear of spending, for humans are always stingy." We gave Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel about them. When Moses came to Pharaoh, he said, "Moses, I think you are bewitched." Moses replied, "You know these signs are from the Lord of the heavens and the earth. I think you are doomed, Pharaoh." Pharaoh wanted to expel them from the land, but We drowned him and his followers. After him, We told the Children of Israel to live in the land, but when the final promise comes, We will gather you all together. We sent down the Qur'an in truth, and it has descended in truth. We sent you only to give good news and to warn. We revealed the Qur'an in parts so you could recite it to people gradually. Say, "Believe in it or not, those who were given knowledge before it fall on their faces in prostration when it is recited." They say, "Glory to our Lord! The promise of our Lord has been fulfilled." They fall down in tears, and it increases their humility. Say, "Call upon God or the Most Merciful; whichever name you use, all the best names belong to Him. Do not be too loud or too quiet in your prayer, but seek a middle course." Say, "Praise be to God, who has no son, no partner in His dominion, and no need for a protector from humiliation. Magnify Him for His greatness and glory."

Chapter 18: The Cave

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God, who sent the Book to His servant and made it free of any crookedness. It is straight and clear to warn of severe punishment from Him and to give good news to the believers who do righteous deeds.Chapter 18: The Cave

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God, who sent the Book to His servant and made it free of any crookedness. It is straight and clear to warn of severe punishment from Him and to give good news to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward, where they will remain forever. It also warns those who say, "God has taken a son." They have no knowledge of this, nor did their ancestors. What they say is a grievous falsehood. You might torment yourself with grief over their disbelief in this message. Everything on earth is a glittering show to test who is best in conduct. Eventually, all will become dust and dry soil.

Do you think the story of the Companions of the Cave and the Inscription is a wonder among Our signs? When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they prayed, "Our Lord, grant us mercy from You and guide us in our affair." We sealed their hearing in the cave for many years. Then We awakened them to see which of the two groups could best calculate the time they had stayed. We narrate their story in truth: they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god other than Him; if we did, we would be uttering an enormity." Their people had taken other gods without any clear authority. Who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against God?

When you turn away from them and what they worship besides God, seek refuge in the cave. Your Lord will shower His mercy on you and make your affair easy. You would have seen the sun, when it rose, decline to the right of their cave, and when it set, turn away to the left, while they lay in the open space in the midst of the cave. This is one of the signs of God. Whom God guides is rightly guided, but whom He leaves to stray, you will find no protector to lead him to the right way. You would have thought them awake while they were asleep. We turned them to the right and left, and their dog stretched its paws at the entrance. If you had seen them, you would have turned back in flight, filled with terror.

We awakened them so they could question each other. One of them asked, "How long have we stayed here?" They said, "A day or part of a day." Others said, "Your Lord knows best how long we have stayed. Now send one of you with this silver coin to the city to find the purest food and bring some back. Let him be courteous and not inform anyone about you." If they discover you, they will stone you or force you back to their religion, and you will never succeed. Thus, We made their case known to the people so they might know that God's promise is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. They disputed among themselves about their affair. Some said, "Construct a building over them." Their Lord knows best about them. Those who prevailed in their affair said, "Let us build a place of worship over them." This was to show that God's promise is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour of Judgment.

When the people of the city argued about their case, they decided to construct a building over them. Some said, "They were three, and their dog was the fourth." Others guessed, "They were five, and their dog was the sixth." Yet others said, "They were seven, and their dog was the eighth." Say, "My Lord knows best their number; only a few know the truth." So don't argue about them except with clear evidence, and don't consult anyone about the Sleepers. Don't say, "I will do this tomorrow," without adding, "If God wills." Remember your Lord when you forget and say, "I hope my Lord will guide me closer to the right path." They stayed in their cave for 300 years, adding nine more. Say, "God knows best how long they stayed. He knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees and hears everything! They have no protector other than Him, and He shares His command with no one."

Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. No one can change His words, and you will find no refuge other than Him. Stay patient with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. Don't let your eyes overlook them, desiring the glitter of this life. Don't obey those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow their own desires and have gone beyond all bounds. Say, "The truth is from your Lord." Let those who will, believe, and let those who will, disbelieve. We have prepared a Fire for the wrongdoers, whose walls will enclose them. If they ask for relief, they will be given water like molten brass, which will scald their faces. How dreadful the drink and how uncomfortable the resting place!

As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will not let the reward of anyone who does a good deed be lost. They will have Gardens of Eternity, with rivers flowing beneath them. They will be adorned with bracelets of gold and wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining on raised thrones. How good the reward and how beautiful the resting place!

Tell them the parable of two men: We provided one of them with two gardens of grapevines, surrounded by date palms, with cornfields in between. Both gardens produced their fruit without fail, and We caused a river to flow through them. The man had abundant produce and said to his companion during a conversation, "I have more wealth and a larger following than you." He entered his garden, wronging himself, and said, "I don't think this will ever perish, nor do I think the Hour of Judgment will come. Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find something better in exchange."

His companion, during their argument, said, "Do you deny the One who created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, and then shaped you into a man?" He continued, "But as for me, God is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with Him." "Why didn't you say, when you entered your garden, 'This is what God wills; there is no power except with God'? Even if you see me as less wealthy and with fewer children than you, it may be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden and send a calamity from the sky upon your garden, turning it into barren ground. Or its water might sink deep into the earth, making it impossible for you to retrieve it." And so, his fruits were destroyed, and he began wringing his hands over what he had spent on it, as it lay in ruins. He said, "Woe is me! I wish I had not associated anyone with my Lord." He had no group to help him against God, nor could he defend himself. In this situation, the only protection comes from God, the True One. He is the best to reward and the best to give success.

Give them the example of the life of this world: it is like the rain We send down from the sky, which the earth's vegetation absorbs, but soon it becomes dry stubble scattered by the winds. God prevails over all things. Wealth and children are the adornments of this worldly life, but the enduring good deeds are better in the sight of your Lord for reward and hope. One day, We will remove the mountains, and you will see the earth as a level plain. We will gather them all together, leaving no one behind. They will be presented before your Lord in rows, and it will be said, "Now you have come to Us as We created you the first time, but you thought We had set no appointment for you." The Book of Deeds will be placed before them, and you will see the sinners in great fear because of what is recorded in it. They will say, "Woe to us! What kind of book is this that leaves out nothing, small or great, but takes account of everything?" They will find all that they did present before them, and your Lord will not wrong anyone.

Remember when We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam," and they all bowed except Iblis. He was one of the jinn and disobeyed his Lord's command. Will you then take him and his descendants as protectors instead of Me, even though they are your enemies? What a terrible exchange for the wrongdoers! I did not make them witnesses to the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor to their own creation, nor do I take misleaders as helpers. On the Day when He will say, "Call on those whom you thought to be My partners," they will call on them, but they will not respond, and We will place a barrier between them. The sinners will see the Fire and realize that they are about to fall into it, and they will find no way to escape.

We have explained in detail in this Qur'an, for the benefit of mankind, every kind of example, but man is, in most things, contentious. What is there to keep people from believing now that guidance has come to them, or from seeking forgiveness from their Lord, except that they wish for the same fate as the ancients? Or the punishment comes to them directly? What stops people from believing when guidance comes to them and from asking for forgiveness from their Lord, except that they wish for the same fate as those before them or to face the punishment directly? We only send messengers to give good news and warnings. But the disbelievers argue with falsehood to weaken the truth, treating My signs and warnings as a joke. Who does more wrong than someone who is reminded of their Lord's signs but turns away, forgetting their own deeds? We have placed veils over their hearts and deafness in their ears, so they cannot understand. Even if you call them to guidance, they will never follow the right path. Your Lord is Most Forgiving and Full of Mercy. If He were to call them to account for their deeds immediately, He would hasten their punishment. But they have an appointed time from which they cannot escape. We destroyed the populations that committed injustices, but we fixed a time for their destruction.Moses said to his attendant, "I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if it takes years." When they reached the junction, they forgot about their fish, which took its course through the sea. After they had passed on, Moses said to his attendant, "Bring us our meal; we are tired from our journey." The attendant replied, "Do you remember when we rested by the rock? I forgot the fish, and only Satan made me forget to mention it. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way." Moses said, "That is what we were seeking." So they retraced their steps. They found one of Our servants, whom We had given mercy and taught knowledge. Moses said to him, "May I follow you so that you can teach me some of the knowledge you have been taught?" The servant replied, "You will not be able to have patience with me. How can you be patient about things you do not understand?" Moses said, "If God wills, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything." The servant said, "If you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I mention it to you." So they proceeded until they were in a boat, and the servant made a hole in it. Moses said, "Have you made a hole to drown the people in it? You have done a strange thing!" The servant replied, "Did I not tell you that you would not be able to have patience with me?" Moses said, "Do not be angry with me for forgetting, and do not make my journey difficult." They continued until they met a young man, and the servant killed him. Moses said, "Have you killed an innocent person who has killed no one? You have done a terrible thing!" The servant replied, "Did I not tell you that you would not be able to have patience with me?" Moses said, "If I ask you about anything after this, do not keep me in your company. You have received an excuse from me." They proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town, and they asked for food, but the people refused to host them. They found a wall about to collapse, and the servant repaired it. Moses said, "If you wanted, you could have asked for payment for fixing it." The servant replied, "This is where we part ways. I will explain the things you couldn't understand. The boat belonged to poor people working on the river. I damaged it because a king was seizing every boat by force. The young man had parents who were believers, and we feared he would cause them grief through rebellion and ingratitude. We hoped their Lord would give them a better, more compassionate child. The wall belonged to two orphan boys in the town. Beneath it was a treasure meant for them, as their father was a righteous man. Your Lord wanted them to grow up and retrieve their treasure as a mercy from Him. I did none of this on my own accord. This is the explanation of what you couldn't bear." They asked you about Zul-Qarnain. Say, "I will tell you something about him." We established his power on earth and gave him the means to achieve everything. He followed a path until he reached the setting of the sun, where he found it setting in a muddy spring and encountered a people. We said, "O Zul-Qarnain! You can either punish them or treat them with kindness." He said, "Whoever does wrong, we will punish, and then he will be returned to his Lord, who will punish him severely. But whoever believes and does good will have a good reward, and we will speak to him kindly." Then he followed another path until he reached the rising of the sun, where he found it rising on a people with no shelter from it. He left them as they were, and we fully understood his situation. He followed another path until he reached a place between two mountains, where he found a people who could barely understand a word. They said, "O Zul-Qarnain! Gog and Magog are causing trouble in the land. Can we pay you to build a barrier between us and them?" He replied, "What my Lord has given me is better, but help me with your strength, and I will build a strong barrier between you and them. Bring me blocks of iron." When he had filled the gap between the mountains, he said, "Blow with your bellows." When the iron was red hot, he said, "Bring me molten copper to pour over it." They were unable to scale or dig through it. He said, "This is a mercy from my Lord. But when my Lord's promise comes to pass, He will make it into dust, for His promise is true." On that day, we will let them surge against each other like waves, and the trumpet will be blown, gathering them all together. On that day, we will present Hell to the disbelievers, fully exposed. These are the people whose eyes were covered from remembering Me and who couldn't even hear. Do the disbelievers think they can take My servants as protectors besides Me? We have prepared Hell as a welcome for the disbelievers. Say, "Shall we tell you who will lose the most in their deeds? Those whose efforts were wasted in this life while they thought they were doing good." These are the ones who deny the signs of their Lord and the fact that they will meet Him. Their works are in vain, and on the Day of Judgment, we will give them no weight. Their reward is Hell because they rejected faith and mocked My signs and messengers. But those who believe and do good deeds will have the Gardens of Paradise for their entertainment. They will live there forever, without any desire to leave. Say, "If the ocean were ink to write the words of my Lord, the ocean would be exhausted before the words of my Lord are finished, even if we added another ocean like it." Say, "I am just a man like you, but it has been revealed to me that your God is one God. Whoever hopes to meet his Lord should do good deeds and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord." 

Chapter 19: Maryam (Mary)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ain. Sad. This is a recital of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zakariya. When he cried to his Lord in secret, saying, "My Lord, my bones are weak, and my hair is gray, but I have never been unblessed in my prayer to You. I fear what my relatives will do after me, and my wife is barren. So give me an heir from Yourself, who will inherit from me and the family of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased." His prayer was answered: "O Zakariya, We give you good news of a son. His name will be Yahya (John). We have not given this name to anyone before." Zakariya said, "My Lord, how can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I have reached old age?" The answer came, "So it will be. Your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me. I created you before when you were nothing.'" Zakariya asked for a sign. The answer was, "Your sign is that you will not speak to people for three nights, although you are not dumb." So Zakariya came out to his people from his chamber and signaled to them to celebrate God's praises in the morning and evening. To his son came the command: "O Yahya, take hold of the Book with strength." And We gave him wisdom even as a youth, along with compassion and purity from Us. He was devout, kind to his parents, and not overbearing or rebellious. Peace be upon him the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day he will be raised to life again. Relate in the Book the story of Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East. She placed a screen to screen herself from them, and We sent her Our angel, who appeared before her as a man in all respects. Mary said, "I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, if you fear God." The angel replied, "I am only a messenger from your Lord to announce the gift of a pure son to you." Mary questioned, "How can I have a son when no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?" The angel responded, "Your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me. We will make him a sign for humanity and a mercy from Us. This is a matter already decreed.'" So Mary conceived him and withdrew to a remote place. The pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree, and she cried out in anguish, "I wish I had died before this and was forgotten." But a voice called out from beneath her, "Do not grieve! Your Lord has provided a stream beneath you. Shake the trunk of the palm tree, and fresh, ripe dates will fall upon you. Eat, drink, and be comforted. If you see anyone, say, 'I have vowed a fast to the Most Merciful, so I will not speak to any human today.'" Mary then brought the baby to her people, who were astonished and said, "O Mary, you have done something unprecedented! O sister of Aaron, your father was not a wicked man, nor was your mother unchaste." Mary pointed to the baby, and they asked, "How can we speak to a child in the cradle?" The baby spoke, "I am a servant of God. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet. He has blessed me wherever I am and enjoined upon me prayer and charity as long as I live. He made me dutiful to my mother and did not make me arrogant or unblessed. Peace is upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I will be raised to life again." This is Jesus, the son of Mary, a statement of truth about which they dispute. It is not befitting for God to take a son. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, "Be," and it is. God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path. Yet, the sects differ among themselves, and woe to the disbelievers on the Day of Judgment. They will see and hear clearly on that Day, but today they are in manifest error. Warn them of the Day of Distress when the matter will be decided, for they are negligent and do not believe. We will inherit the earth and all beings on it, and to Us, they will all return. Mention in the Book the story of Abraham. He was a man of truth and a prophet. He said to his father, "O my father, why do you worship what does not hear, see, or benefit you in any way? Knowledge has come to me that has not reached you, so follow me, and I will guide you to a straight path.""will guide you to a straight path. Do not worship Satan, for he is a rebel against the Most Merciful. I fear that a punishment from the Most Merciful will afflict you, and you will become a friend of Satan." His father replied, "Do you reject my gods, O Abraham? If you do not stop, I will stone you. Leave me now." Abraham responded, "Peace be upon you. I will ask my Lord to forgive you. He has always been kind to me. I will distance myself from you and your idols and pray to my Lord. Perhaps my prayers will be answered." When Abraham left them and their idols, We blessed him with Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet. We granted them Our mercy and gave them a high and honorable status.

Also, mention in the Book the story of Moses. He was chosen and was a messenger and a prophet. We called him from the right side of Mount Sinai and brought him close for a special conversation. Out of Our mercy, We also made his brother Aaron a prophet.

Mention in the Book the story of Ishmael. He was true to his promises and was a messenger and a prophet. He encouraged his people to pray and give charity, and he was pleasing to his Lord.

Mention in the Book the story of Idris. He was a man of truth and a prophet, and We raised him to a high position. These were some of the prophets whom God blessed, from the descendants of Adam, those carried with Noah, the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and those We guided and chose. When the revelations of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they would fall down in prostration and weep. But after them came generations who neglected prayers and followed their desires. They will face destruction, except those who repent, believe, and do good deeds. They will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least. These are the Gardens of Eternity, promised by the Most Gracious to His servants. His promise will certainly come to pass. They will hear no idle talk there, only peace, and they will have their sustenance morning and evening. This is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against evil.

The angels say, "We descend only by the command of your Lord. To Him belongs what is before us, what is behind us, and what is between. Your Lord never forgets." He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. So worship Him and be steadfast in His service. Do you know anyone equal to Him?

Man says, "What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?" Does man not remember that We created him before, when he was nothing? By your Lord, We will gather them and the devils, and bring them, kneeling, around Hell. We will then pull out from every group those who were most stubborn in rebellion against the Most Gracious. We know best who deserves to be burned in Hell. Every one of you will pass over it; this is a decree from your Lord that must be accomplished. But We will save those who guarded against evil and leave the wrongdoers there, humbled on their knees.

When Our clear signs are presented to them, the disbelievers say to the believers, "Which of us is better in status and appearance?" But how many generations before them have We destroyed, who were even more impressive in wealth and appearance? Say: "For those who go astray, the Most Gracious extends their time until they see the promised punishment or the Hour. Then they will realize who is in the worst position and weakest in forces." God increases guidance for those who seek it, and good deeds that last are best in the sight of your Lord for reward and outcome.

Have you seen the one who rejects Our signs and says, "I will surely be given wealth and children"? Has he seen the unseen, or has he made a pact with the Most Gracious? No, We will record what he says and extend his punishment. Everything he talks about will return to Us, and he will come to Us alone. They have taken other gods besides God to give them power and glory. But these gods will deny their worship and become their adversaries. Do you not see that We have sent the devils against the disbelievers to incite them? So do not be in haste against them; We are only counting out a limited number of days for them.

On the Day We gather the righteous to the Most Gracious like a band presented before a king for honors, and drive the sinners to Hell like thirsty cattle, none will have the power of intercession except those who have received permission from the Most Gracious. They say, "The Most Gracious has begotten a son!" Indeed, you have said something monstrous. The skies are ready to burst, the earth to split, and the mountains to fall in ruins because they ascribe a son to the Most Gracious. It is not fitting for the Most Gracious to have a son. Everyone in the heavens and the earth must come to the Most Gracious as a servant. He has counted and numbered them all exactly, and each one will come to Him alone on the Day of Judgment. For those who believe and do good deeds, the Most Gracious will bestow love.

We have made the Qur'an easy in your language so you can give good news to the righteous and warn those who are contentious. How many generations before them have We destroyed? Can you see any of them or hear even a whisper from them?

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Qur'an to cause you distress, but as a reminder for those who fear God. It is a revelation from Him who created the earth and the high heavens. The Most Gracious is firmly established on the throne of authority. To Him belongs everything in the heavens, on earth, and all between them, and all beneath the soil. If you speak aloud, it doesn't matter because He knows what is secret and even what is more hidden. God! There is no god but Him! He has the most beautiful names.

Have you heard the story of Moses? When he saw a fire, he told his family, "Wait here; I see a fire. Maybe I can bring you a burning brand from it or find some guidance there." When he approached the fire, a voice called out, "O Moses! I am your Lord. Take off your shoes; you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa. I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed. I am God; there is no god but Me. Serve Me and establish regular prayer to remember Me. The Hour is coming, but I choose to keep it hidden so that every soul may be rewarded according to its efforts. Do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their desires divert you from it, or you will perish."

God asked, "What is that in your right hand, O Moses?" Moses replied, "It is my staff; I lean on it, beat down fodder for my flocks, and have other uses for it." God said, "Throw it down, O Moses!" When he did, it became a snake, moving swiftly. God then said, "Seize it and do not fear; We will return it to its original state. Now, place your hand under your arm; it will come out white and shining without harm. This is another sign. Go to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds."

Moses said, "O my Lord! Expand my chest, ease my task, and remove the impediment from my speech so they may understand what I say. Give me a helper from my family, Aaron, my brother. Strengthen me through him and make him share my task so we may celebrate Your praise and remember You often. You are always watching over us." God said, "Your request is granted, O Moses. We have shown you favor before. We inspired your mother to put you in a chest and cast it into the river. The river brought you to an enemy of Mine and yours. But I cast love over you so you would be raised under My watchful eye. Your sister went and said, 'Shall I show you someone who will nurse him?' So We returned you to your mother to comfort her and not let her grieve. You killed a man, but We saved you from distress and tested you in various ways. You stayed with the people of Midian for years and then came here as ordained, O Moses. I have prepared you for Myself. Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken in remembering Me. Go to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds. Speak to him gently so he may take warning or fear God."

Moses and Aaron said, "Our Lord! We fear he may act hastily against us or transgress all bounds." God replied, "Do not fear; I am with you. I hear and see everything." "Don't be afraid. I am with both of you, hearing and seeing everything," said God. "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'We are messengers from your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with us and do not harm them. We bring a sign from your Lord, and peace will be upon those who follow guidance.'"

Moses and Aaron approached Pharaoh and delivered the message. Pharaoh asked, "Who is your Lord, Moses?" Moses replied, "Our Lord is the one who gave everything its form and guided it." Pharaoh then questioned, "What about the previous generations?" Moses answered, "The knowledge of that is with my Lord, recorded in a book. My Lord never makes mistakes or forgets." Moses continued, "He made the earth a place for you to live, created paths for you, and sent down water from the sky, producing various plants. Eat and feed your cattle; there are signs in this for those who understand. We created you from the earth, and to it, you will return, and from it, you will be brought out again."

Despite seeing all the signs, Pharaoh rejected and refused them. He accused Moses of using magic to drive them out of their land. Pharaoh challenged Moses to a contest of magic, and Moses agreed, setting the day of the festival as the time for their showdown. On the day of the festival, Pharaoh gathered his magicians. Moses warned them, "Do not lie against God, or He will destroy you with punishment. Those who lie will fail." The magicians debated among themselves but eventually decided to proceed. They said to Moses, "Will you throw first, or shall we?" Moses told them to go first. Their ropes and rods appeared to move like snakes due to their magic, causing Moses to feel a moment of fear. But God...Pharaoh reassured him, "Do not be afraid; you have the upper hand. Throw what is in your right hand, and it will swallow what they have created. Their magic is just a trick, and magicians will not succeed." When Moses threw his staff, it devoured the magicians' creations. The magicians then fell in prostration, declaring, "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses." Pharaoh, furious, said, "You believe in Him before I give you permission? This must be a plot you devised. I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you on palm trees. Then you will know who can give the more severe and lasting punishment." The magicians responded, "We will never prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us and over the One who created us. Do whatever you will; you can only affect this worldly life." "We believe in our Lord so that He may forgive our sins and the magic you forced us to practice. God is better and everlasting." "Whoever comes to their Lord as a sinner will face Hell, where they will neither die nor live. But those who come as believers, having done good deeds, will have high ranks in the Gardens of Eternity, where rivers flow beneath. They will dwell there forever as a reward for purifying themselves." "We inspired Moses to travel by night with My servants and make a dry path through the sea without fear of being overtaken by Pharaoh." Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the sea overwhelmed and covered them. Pharaoh led his people astray instead of guiding them. "O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, made a covenant with you on the right side of Mount Sinai, and sent down manna and quails. Eat the good things We have provided, but do not commit excess, or My wrath will descend on you. Those who face My wrath are truly lost. However, I am forgiving to those who repent, believe, and do good deeds, and who follow the right path." When Moses was on the Mount, God asked, "What made you hasten away from your people, O Moses?" Moses replied, "They are close behind me. I hastened to You, my Lord, to please You." God said, "We have tested your people in your absence, and the Samiri has led them astray." Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful. He said, "O my people! Did your Lord not make a good promise to you? Did the time seem too long, or did you desire that wrath should descend from your Lord, so you broke your promise to me?" They replied, "We did not break our promise to you willingly, but we were burdened with the ornaments of the people, and we threw them into the fire as the Samiri suggested." The Samiri then brought out a calf that seemed to low, and they said, "This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten." Moses asked, "Could they not see that it could not return a word to them and had no power to harm or benefit them?" Aaron had already told them, "O my people! You are being tested with this. Your Lord is the Most Gracious, so follow me and obey my command." But they said, "We will not abandon this cult until Moses returns to us." Moses said to Aaron, "What kept you back when you saw them going wrong? Did you disobey my order?" Aaron replied, "O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard or my head. I feared you would say I caused division among the Children of Israel and did not respect your word." Moses then asked Samiri, "What is your case?" Samiri replied, "I saw what they did not see. I took a handful of dust from the footprint of the Messenger and threw it into the calf. My soul suggested this to me." Moses said, "Leave! Your punishment in this life will be that you will say, 'Do not touch me.' And you have a promise that will not fail in the future. Look at your god, which you have worshipped. We will burn it and scatter its ashes into the sea." "Your only God is God. There is no god but Him. He knows everything." "We share these stories with you, Muhammad, as a reminder from Us. If anyone turns away from it, they will bear a heavy burden on the Day of Judgment. They will remain in this state, and it will be a grievous burden for them on that Day." "On the Day when the Trumpet is blown, we will gather the sinful, terrified. They will whisper to each other, 'We only stayed for ten days.' We know best what they will say when their leader says, 'You only stayed for a day.'" "They ask you about the mountains. Say, 'My Lord will scatter them as dust and leave the land flat and smooth. You will see no crookedness or unevenness.'" "On that Day, they will follow the Caller without deviation. All voices will be hushed before the Most Gracious, and you will hear only a faint murmur." "On that Day, no intercession will help except for those whom God allows and whose word He accepts. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, but they cannot comprehend it." "All faces will be humbled before the Living, the Eternal. Those who carry wrongdoing will be failures. But those who do good deeds and believe will have no fear of injustice or deprivation." "We have sent down this Arabic Qur'an and explained it in detail so that they may fear God or be reminded of Him." "Exalted is God, the True King! Do not be hasty with the Qur'an before its revelation is completed to you, and say, 'My Lord, increase me in knowledge.'" "We made a covenant with Adam, but he forgot, and we found no determination in him. When we said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam,' they all did except Iblis, who refused." "We said, 'O Adam, this is an enemy to you and your wife. Do not let him drive you both out of the Garden, or you will be miserable. You will not go hungry or naked there, nor suffer from thirst or the sun's heat.'" "But Satan whispered to him, 'O Adam, shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and a kingdom that never decays?' They both ate from the tree, and their nakedness became apparent. They began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden. Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray." "But his Lord chose him, turned to him, and gave him guidance." Then his Lord chose him, turned to him, and guided him. God said, "Descend from the Garden, both of you, as enemies to each other. But when guidance comes from Me, whoever follows My guidance will not go astray or be miserable." "But whoever turns away from My message will have a difficult life, and We will raise him blind on the Day of Judgment." He will say, "My Lord, why have You raised me blind when I used to see?" God will respond, "Just as Our signs came to you and you ignored them, so today you will be ignored." This is how We repay those who go beyond bounds and do not believe in the signs of their Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter is much more severe and lasting. Is it not a warning to them how many generations We destroyed before them, whose dwellings they now walk through? Surely, there are signs in this for those with understanding. If it were not for a decree from your Lord and a fixed term, their punishment would have been inevitable. So be patient with what they say, and praise your Lord before the rising and setting of the sun, and during parts of the night and day, so that you may find joy. Do not long for the things We have given to some of them for enjoyment, the splendor of this worldly life, through which We test them. The provision of your Lord is better and more lasting. Instruct your people to pray and be constant in it. We do not ask you to provide sustenance; We provide it for you. The reward of the Hereafter is for righteousness. They say, "Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?" Has not a clear sign come to them from the former Books of revelation? If We had inflicted a penalty on them before this, they would have said, "Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your signs before we were humbled and disgraced." Say, "Each of us is waiting; wait, therefore, and soon you will know who is on the straight path and who has received guidance." 

Chapter 21: The Prophets

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. The time for mankind's reckoning is drawing closer, yet they turn away in heedlessness. Whenever a renewed message comes to them from their Lord, they listen to it as if it were a joke. Their hearts are distracted, and the wrongdoers secretly conspire, saying, "Is this man anything more than a mortal like yourselves? Will you succumb to magic while you see it?" Say, "My Lord knows every word spoken in the heavens and on earth. He is the One who hears and knows all things." They say, "These are just confused dreams. He made it up. He is just a poet. Let him bring us a sign like the ones sent to the prophets of old." None of the populations We destroyed before them believed; will these people believe? Before you, We only sent men whom We inspired. If you do not know, ask those who possess the message. We did not give them bodies that did not eat food, nor were they exempt from death. We did not give them bodies that didn't need food, nor were they immortal. In the end, We fulfilled Our promise to them, saving those We chose and destroying those who went beyond bounds. We have revealed a book for you with a message. Will you not understand? How many unjust populations have We destroyed, replacing them with others? When they felt Our punishment coming, they tried to flee. But it was said to them, "Do not flee, return to your comforts and homes so you may be questioned." They cried, "Woe to us! We were wrongdoers!" Their cries continued until We made them like a harvested field, silent and extinguished. We did not create the heavens and the earth for idle play. If We wanted a pastime, We could have found it within Our presence, but We do not do such things. Instead, We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it destroys it. Woe to you for the false things you ascribe to Us. To Him belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth. Even those in His presence are not too proud to serve Him and are never weary.They celebrate His praises day and night without pause. Have they taken gods from the earth who can raise the dead? If there were other gods besides God, there would be chaos in the heavens and the earth. Glory to God, the Lord of the Throne, above what they attribute to Him. He cannot be questioned for His actions, but they will be questioned for theirs. Have they taken other gods besides Him? Say, "Bring your proof. This is the message of those with me and those before me." Most of them do not know the truth and turn away. We sent no messenger before you without revealing to him that there is no god but Me, so worship Me. They say, "The Most Gracious has begotten offspring." Glory to Him! They are but honored servants. They do not speak before He speaks and act only by His command. He knows what is before them and what is behind them. They intercede only for those He approves, and they stand in awe of Him. If any of them should say, "I am a god besides Him," We would reward them with Hell. Thus, We repay wrongdoers. Do the unbelievers not see that the heavens and the earth were once joined together, and We split them apart? We made from water every living thing. Will they not believe? We set mountains on the earth to prevent it from shaking and made broad highways for them to pass through so they may receive guidance. We made the heavens a well-guarded canopy, yet they turn away from its signs. He created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, all moving in their orbits. We did not grant immortality to any man before you. If you die, will they live forever? Every soul will taste death, and We test you with both good and evil as a trial. Ultimately, you will return to Us. When non-believers see you, they mock you, saying, "Is this the one who talks about your gods?" They ridicule the mention of God, the Most Gracious. Humans are impatient by nature. Soon, I will show you My signs, but don't ask Me to hasten them. They ask, "When will this promise be fulfilled if you are truthful?" If only the non-believers knew the time when they won't be able to fend off the fire from their faces or backs, and no help will reach them. It will come upon them suddenly, leaving them stunned, unable to repel it or get any respite. Many messengers before you were mocked, but those who mocked them were eventually surrounded by the very thing they ridiculed. Say, "Who can protect you by night and by day from the wrath of God, the Most Gracious?" Yet, they turn away from the mention of their Lord. Do they have gods who can shield them from Us? They cannot help themselves nor be defended from Us. We gave these people and their ancestors good things in life until they grew complacent. Do they not see that We gradually reduce the land under their control from its borders? Can they then be the victors? Say, "I only warn you according to revelation." But the deaf will not hear the call, even when they are warned. If even a breath of your Lord's punishment touches them, they will say, "Woe to us! We were wrongdoers." We will set up scales of justice on the Day of Judgment, so no soul will be treated unjustly. Even if it is as small as a mustard seed, We will bring it to account. We are sufficient to take account. In the past, We granted Moses and Aaron the criterion for judgment, a light, and a message for those who would do right. Those who fear their Lord in their most secret thoughts and who hold the Day of Judgment in awe. This is a blessed message that We have sent down. Will you then reject it? We bestowed upon Abraham his righteousness, and We were well aware of him. He said to his father and his people, "What are these images to which you are so devoted?" They replied, "We found our ancestors worshipping them." He said, "Indeed, you and your ancestors have been in manifest error." They asked, "Have you brought us the truth, or are you joking?" He said, "No, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created them, and I am a witness to this truth." "And by God, I have a plan for your idols after you turn your backs." So he broke them into pieces, except for the biggest one, so they might turn to it. They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He must indeed be a wrongdoer!" They said, "We heard a youth talk about them; he is called Abraham." They said, "Then bring him before the people so they may witness." They asked, "Are you the one who did this to our gods, O Abraham?" He replied, "No, this was done by their biggest one. Ask them if they can speak." So they turned to themselves and said, "Surely, you are the ones in the wrong!" They turned to each other and admitted, "You know these idols can't speak!" Abraham responded, "Do you worship things besides God that can't benefit or harm you? Shame on you and what you worship besides God! Don't you understand?" They decided, "Burn him and defend your gods if you can!" But God said, "O fire, be cool and safe for Abraham!" They plotted against him, but God made them the losers. God saved Abraham and Lot, guiding them to a blessed land. He also blessed Abraham with Isaac and Jacob, making them righteous leaders who guided others by God's command, performed good deeds, prayed regularly, and gave charity. God granted Lot wisdom and knowledge, saving him from a corrupt town. He was righteous and received God's mercy. Remember Noah, who called out to God and was saved from great distress along with his family. God drowned those who denied His signs. David and Solomon judged a case about a field damaged by sheep, and God witnessed their judgment. Solomon was given the right understanding, and both were granted wisdom and knowledge. God made the mountains and birds praise Him with David and taught him to make protective armor. Solomon controlled the wind and had rebellious beings dive for him, all under God's protection. Remember Job, who cried out to God in distress, and God relieved his suffering, restoring his family and doubling their number as a mercy. Isma'il, Idris, and Zul-kifl were all patient and righteous, receiving God's mercy. Zun-nun (Jonah) called out from the darkness, acknowledging his wrongdoing, and God saved him from distress. Zakariya prayed for offspring, and God granted him Yahya (John), curing his wife's barrenness. These prophets were quick to do good, called on God with love and reverence, and humbled themselves before Him. They used to compete in doing good deeds, calling upon Us with hope and fear, and they were humble before Us. So We responded to him and gave him Yahya (John) and made his wife capable of bearing a child. They were always quick to do good, calling upon Us with hope and fear, and they were humble before Us. And remember her who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Our spirit, and We made her and her son a sign for all peoples. This religion of yours is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me. But later generations divided their religion among themselves, yet all will return to Us. Whoever does good deeds and has faith, their efforts will not be rejected; We will record it in their favor. But there is a ban on any population We have destroyed: they shall not return until Gog and Magog are let through, and they swarm from every hill. Then the true promise will draw near, and the eyes of the unbelievers will stare in horror, saying, "Woe to us! We were heedless of this; indeed, we were wrongdoers!" You and what you worship besides God are fuel for Hell; you will surely come to it. If these had been gods, they would not have come there, but all will abide therein. There, sobbing will be their lot, and they will not hear anything else. Those for whom the good record from Us has gone before will be removed far from it. They will not hear the slightest sound of Hell, and they will dwell in what their souls desire. The Great Terror will not grieve them, and the angels will greet them, saying, "This is your Day, the Day you were promised." On the Day when We roll up the heavens like a scroll, as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a new one. This is a promise We have undertaken, and We will fulfill it. Before this, We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message given to Moses: "My righteous servants shall inherit the earth." Indeed, in this Qur'an is a message for people who would truly worship God. We sent you only as a mercy for all creatures. Say: "What has come to me by inspiration is that your God is One God; will you then submit?" But if they turn back, say: "I have proclaimed the Message to you all alike and in truth; but I do not know whether what you are promised is near or far." He knows what is said openly and what you hide. I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision for a time. Say: "O my Lord! Judge in truth! Our Lord Most Gracious is the One Whose assistance should be sought against the blasphemies you utter!"

Chapter 22: The Pilgrimage

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. O mankind! Fear your Lord! The convulsion of the Hour of Judgment will be a terrible thing. On the Day you see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling, and every pregnant woman will drop her load. You will see mankind as if in a drunken riot, yet not drunk, but dreadful will be the Wrath of God. Among men, there are those who dispute about God without knowledge and follow every evil one obstinate in rebellion. It is decreed that whoever turns to him for friendship, he will lead them astray and guide them to the penalty of the Fire. O humanity! If you doubt the Resurrection, consider that We created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then from a clot, then from a lump of flesh, both formed and unformed, to show you Our power. We keep some in the womb for a set time, then bring you out as babies....and defend your gods if you can!" But God said, "O fire, be cool and safe for Abraham!" They plotted against him, but God made them the losers. God saved Abraham and Lot, guiding them to a blessed land. He also blessed Abraham with Isaac and Jacob, making them righteous leaders who guided others by God's command, performed good deeds, prayed regularly, and gave charity. God granted Lot wisdom and knowledge, saving him from a corrupt town. He was righteous and received God's mercy. Remember Noah, who called out to God and was saved from great distress along with his family. God drowned those who denied His signs.

Then the true promise will draw near, and the eyes of the unbelievers will stare in horror, saying, "Woe to us! We were heedless of this; indeed, we were wrongdoers!" You and what you worship besides God are fuel for Hell; you will surely come to it. If these had been gods, they would not have come there, but all will abide therein. There, sobbing will be their lot, and they will not hear anything else. Those for whom the good record from Us has gone before will be removed far from it. They will not hear the slightest sound of Hell, and they will dwell in what their souls desire. The Great Terror will not grieve them, and the angels will greet them, saying, "This is your Day, the Day you were promised." On the Day when We roll up the heavens like a scroll, as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a new one. This is a promise We have undertaken, and We will fulfill it. Before this, We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message given to Moses: "My righteous servants shall inherit the earth." Indeed, in this Qur'an is a message for people who would truly worship God. We sent you only as a mercy for all creatures. Say: "What has come to me by inspiration is that your God is One God; will you then submit?" But if they turn back, say: "I have proclaimed the Message to you all alike and in truth; but I do not know whether what you are promised is near or far." He knows what is said openly and what you hide. I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision for a time. Say: "O my Lord! Judge in truth! Our Lord Most Gracious is the One Whose assistance should be sought against the blasphemies you utter!"

Chapter 22: The Pilgrimage

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. O mankind! Fear your Lord! The convulsion of the Hour of Judgment will be a terrible thing. On the Day you see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling, and every pregnant woman will drop her load. You will see mankind as if in a drunken riot, yet not drunk, but dreadful will be the Wrath of God. Among men, there are those who dispute about God without knowledge and follow every evil one obstinate in rebellion. It is decreed that whoever turns to him for friendship, he will lead them astray and guide them to the penalty of the Fire. O humanity! If you doubt the Resurrection, consider that We created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then from a clot, then from a lump of flesh, both formed and unformed, to show you Our power. We keep some in the womb for a set time, then bring you out as babies, so you may grow to full strength. Some of you die young, while others live to old age, forgetting what they once knew. You see the earth barren, but when We send rain, it stirs to life, swells, and produces beautiful growth. This is because God is the ultimate truth, the one who gives life to the dead and has power over all things. The Hour of Judgment will come without doubt, and God will raise those in the graves. Yet, some people argue about God without knowledge, guidance, or an enlightening book. They turn away in pride, leading others astray. For them, there is disgrace in this life and the penalty of burning in the Hereafter. This is due to their deeds, for God is never unjust to His servants. Some people worship God on the edge; if good comes, they are content, but if a trial comes, they turn away, losing both this world and the Hereafter. They call on deities besides God that can neither harm nor benefit them, straying far from the right path. They call on those whose harm is closer than their benefit, making them poor guardians and companions. God will admit those who believe and do good deeds into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. God does what He wills. If anyone thinks God will not help His Messenger in this world and the Hereafter, let them try to stop it and see if their plan works. We have sent down clear signs, and God guides whom He wills. Those who believe, the Jews, the Sabians, the Christians, the Magians, and the polytheists—God will judge between them on the Day of Judgment. God witnesses all things. Do you not see that everything in the heavens and on earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the hills, the trees, the animals, and many humans bow down to God? But many are also destined for punishment. Those whom God disgraces, no one can honor. God does what He wills. These two groups (believers and disbelievers) dispute about their Lord. For those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them, and boiling water will be poured over their heads, melting their insides and skins. They will also have iron rods to punish them. Every time they try to escape their suffering, they will be forced back and told, "Taste the penalty of burning!" God will admit those who believe and do good deeds into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. They will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments will be of silk. They are guided to the purest of speeches and the path of the Praised One. Those who reject God and prevent others from His way and the Sacred Mosque, which is open to all, will face a grievous penalty. Anyone who seeks to do wrong there will taste a painful punishment. We gave Abraham the site of the Sacred House, instructing him not to associate anything with God and to purify the House for those who circle it, stand, bow, and prostrate in prayer. Proclaim the pilgrimage to all people; they will come on foot and on lean camels from distant places to witness benefits and celebrate God's name over the cattle provided for sacrifice. Eat from them and feed the needy. Complete the prescribed rites, fulfill your vows, and circle the Ancient House. Honoring God's sacred rites is good in His sight. Cattle are lawful for food except those mentioned as exceptions. Avoid the filth of idols and false speech. Be true in faith to God, not assigning partners to Him. Whoever does so is like someone falling from the sky, snatched by birds or blown away by the wind. Respecting God's symbols, such as the sacrificial animals, comes from piety of heart. These animals provide benefits for a set time, and their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House. Every nation has appointed rites to celebrate God's name over the sustenance He provided. Your God is One, so submit to Him and give good news to the humble. Those whose hearts tremble when God is mentioned, who show patience in affliction, keep up regular prayer, and spend in charity from what God has given them, will be rewarded. The sacrificial camels are symbols from God, providing much good. Mention God's name over them when they line up for sacrifice. When they fall, eat from them and feed the contented and the beggars. This is so you may be grateful. It is not their meat or blood that reaches God, but your piety. God has made them subject to you so you may glorify Him for His guidance. Give good news to those who do right. God does not care about the meat or blood of the sacrificial animals, but He values your piety. He made these animals subservient to you so you can magnify Him for His guidance. Give good news to those who do good. God will defend those who believe. He does not love traitors or the ungrateful. Permission to fight is given to those who are wronged, and God is powerful enough to help them. Those who have been unjustly expelled from their homes just for saying, "Our Lord is God," will be aided by God. If God did not repel some people by means of others, places of worship would be destroyed. God helps those who help His cause; He is strong and mighty. Those who, if given power, establish regular prayer, give charity, and promote good while forbidding wrong, will find that all affairs rest with God. If people reject your mission, remember that previous peoples, like those of Noah, 'Ad, Thamud, Abraham, Lot, and Midian, also rejected their prophets. God gave the disbelievers time, but then He punished them severely. Many towns that were unjust have been destroyed, leaving their buildings in ruins. Do they not travel and learn wisdom? It is not their eyes that are blind, but their hearts. They ask for the punishment to be hastened, but God's promise will not fail. A day with God is like a thousand years of human reckoning. Many towns were given respite despite their wrongdoing, but eventually, they faced punishment. To God is the return of all. Say, "O people! I am only a plain warner to you." Those who believe and do good deeds will have forgiveness and generous sustenance. Those who strive against God's signs will be companions of the Fire. Every messenger or prophet faced opposition from Satan, but God cancels Satan's influence and confirms His signs. This is a test for those with diseased hearts and hardened hearts. The wrongdoers are in clear opposition. Those with knowledge will recognize the truth from their Lord and believe in it, humbling their hearts. God guides those who believe to the right path. Disbelievers will remain in doubt until the Hour of Judgment or a day of disaster comes upon them. On that day, God will judge between them. Believers who do good deeds will be in Gardens of Delight, while those who reject faith and deny God's signs will face a humiliating punishment. Those who disbelieve and reject Our signs will face a disgraceful punishment. Those who leave their homes for the cause of God and are then killed or die will receive a generous provision from God, who is the best provider. He will admit them to a place they will love, for God is All-Knowing and Most Forbearing. If someone retaliates only to the extent of the injury they received and is wronged again, God will help them. God is forgiving and merciful. This is because God merges night into day and day into night, and He hears and sees everything. God is the ultimate truth, and anything worshipped besides Him is false. Do you not see how God sends down rain, making the earth green? God understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted with them. Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. He is self-sufficient and worthy of all praise. God has made everything on earth and the ships that sail the seas subject to you by His command. He withholds the sky from falling on the earth except by His permission. God is kind and merciful to humanity. He gave you life, will cause you to die, and will bring you back to life again. Yet, humans are often ungrateful. Every people have their own rites and ceremonies. Do not dispute with them about this, but invite them to your Lord, for you are on the right path. If they argue with you, say, "God knows best what you are doing." God will judge between you on the Day of Judgment concerning your differences. Do you not know that God knows everything in the heavens and the earth? It is all recorded, and that is easy for God. Yet, they worship things besides God for which no authority has been sent down and of which they have no knowledge. For those who do wrong, there is no helper. When Our clear signs are recited to them, you will see denial on the faces of the disbelievers. They almost attack those who recite Our signs. Say, "Shall I tell you of something worse than these signs? It is the Fire of Hell, promised to the disbelievers, and it is an evil destination." O people, listen to this parable: Those you call upon besides God cannot create even a fly, and if the fly takes something from them, they cannot retrieve it. Both the seeker and the sought are weak. They have not made a just estimate of God, who is strong and mighty. God chooses messengers from angels and from humans. He hears and sees everything. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and all matters return to Him. O believers, bow down, prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord, and do good so that you may prosper. Strive sincerely and with discipline for God. He has chosen you and made religion easy for you, following the faith of your forefather Abraham. He named you Muslims before and in this Revelation so that the Messenger may be a witness for you, and you may be witnesses for humanity. Establish regular prayer, give charity, and hold fast to God. He is your Protector, the best to protect and help. Successful indeed are the believers who humble themselves in their prayers, avoid vain talk, are active in charity, guard their modesty except with their spouses or those...Those who guard their modesty except with their spouses or those their right hands possess, and faithfully observe their trusts and covenants, will inherit Paradise and dwell there forever. We created man from clay, then made him a drop of sperm in a secure place, then a clot, then a lump, then bones clothed with flesh, and finally another creation. Blessed be God, the best to create. After that, you will die and be raised again on the Day of Judgment. We created seven heavens above you and are never unmindful of creation. We send down water from the sky in due measure, causing it to soak into the soil, and we can easily drain it off. With it, we grow gardens of date-palms and vines with abundant fruits for you to eat. We also created a tree from Mount Sinai that produces oil and relish for food. In cattle, there is a lesson for you. We produce milk for you to drink and many other benefits, including meat. You are carried on them and on ships. We sent Noah to his people, saying, "O my people, worship God. You have no other god but Him. Will you not fear Him?" The chiefs of the unbelievers among his people said, "He is just a man like you, trying to assert his superiority. If God had wished, He could have sent down angels. We never heard such a thing from our ancestors." They said, "He is possessed; wait and have patience with him for a time." Noah said, "O my Lord, help me, for they accuse me of falsehood." We inspired him to construct the Ark under Our guidance. When Our command comes and the earth gushes forth, take pairs of every species and your family, except those against whom the Word has already gone forth. Do not plead with Me for the wrong-doers; they will be drowned. When you embark on the Ark, say, "Praise be to God, who has saved us from the wrong-doers." When you and those with you are safely on the Ark, say: "Praise be to God, who saved us from the wrongdoers." And when you disembark, say: "O my Lord, let me land with Your blessing, for You are the best to enable us to land." Indeed, there are signs in this for people to understand, as We continually test humanity. After them, We raised another generation and sent them a messenger from among themselves, saying, "Worship God; you have no other god but Him. Will you not fear Him?" The leaders of his people, who disbelieved and denied the Hereafter, and whom We had blessed with the good things of this life, said, "He is just a man like you, eating and drinking as you do. If you follow a man like yourselves, you will surely be lost. Does he promise that when you die and become dust and bones, you will be brought forth again? Far-fetched is what you are promised! There is nothing but our life in this world; we die and we live, and we will not be resurrected. He is just a man who has invented a lie against God, and we will not believe in him." The prophet said, "O my Lord, help me, for they accuse me of falsehood." God replied, "In a little while, they will surely be sorry." Then the Blast overtook them justly, and We made them like debris. So away with the people who do wrong! After them, We raised other generations. No people can hasten their term, nor can they delay it. We sent our messengers in succession; every time a messenger came to a people, they accused him of falsehood. So We made them follow one another in punishment and made them stories. So away with people who do not believe! Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and clear authority to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they behaved arrogantly and were an insolent people. They said, "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves, while their people are subject to us?" So they denied them and became of those who were destroyed. We gave Moses the Book so that they might receive guidance. We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign and gave them shelter on high ground, affording rest and security with springs. O messengers, enjoy good and pure things and work righteousness, for I am well-acquainted with all that you do. This community of yours is a single community, and I am your Lord, so fear Me. But people have divided their religion into sects, each rejoicing in what they have. So leave them in their confused ignorance for a time. Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and sons, We are hastening to them with good things? No, they do not understand. Those who live in awe of their Lord, who believe in His signs, who do not associate partners with Him, and who give charity with hearts full of fear because they will return to their Lord, these are the ones who hasten in every good work and are foremost in them. We do not place a burden on any soul greater than it can bear. We have a record that clearly shows the truth, and no one will be wronged. But their hearts are in confused ignorance, and they continue with their deeds. When We seize those who enjoyed the good things of this world with punishment, they will cry out in supplication. But it will be said, "Do not cry out for help today; you will not be helped by Us." "My signs were recited to you, but you turned away in arrogance, talking nonsense about the Quran as if it were fables told at night. Do they not ponder over the Word of God, or has something new come to them that did not come to their ancestors? Or do they not recognize their Messenger, so they deny him? Or do they say, 'He is possessed'? No, he has brought them the truth, but most of them hate the truth. If the truth had followed their desires, the heavens and the earth and everything in them would have been corrupted. But We have sent them their reminder, and they turn away from it. Do you ask them for any recompense? The recompense of your Lord is best, for He is the best provider. You call them to the straight path, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from that path. If We had mercy on them and removed their distress, they would persist in their transgression, wandering blindly. We have already inflicted punishment on them, but they did not humble themselves to their Lord, nor did they pray. When We open a gate of severe punishment for them, they will be plunged into despair. It is He who created for you hearing, sight, and understanding, yet you give little thanks. He has multiplied you through the earth, and to Him, you will be gathered back. He gives life and death, and He controls the alternation of night and day. Do you not understand? They say things similar to what the ancients said: 'When we die and become dust and bones, will we really be raised up again?' They say, 'This has been promised to us and our ancestors before; these are just tales of the ancients.' Say, 'To whom does the earth and everything in it belong, if you know?' They will say, 'To God.' Say, 'Will you not then receive admonition?' Say, 'Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Throne Supreme?' They will say, 'They belong to God.' Say, 'Will you not then be filled with awe?' Say, 'Who is it in whose hands is the governance of all things, who protects all but is not protected by any?' They will say, 'It belongs to God.' Say, 'Then how are you deluded?' We have sent them the truth, but they practice falsehood. God has not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him. If there were many gods, each would have taken away what he created, and some would have lorded over others. Glory to God, He is free from what they attribute to Him. He knows everything. God knows everything, both seen and unseen, and is far above the partners they attribute to Him. Say, "My Lord, if You show me what they are warned about, do not place me among the wrongdoers." We are fully capable of showing you what We have promised them. Repel evil with what is best; We are aware of what they say. Say, "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the suggestions of the evil ones, and I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they come near me." When death comes to one of them, they will say, "My Lord, send me back so I can do good in what I neglected." But no, it is just a word they say. Behind them is a barrier until the Day they are raised up. When the Trumpet is blown, there will be no relationships between them that day, nor will they ask about one another. Those whose good deeds are heavy will be successful, but those whose deeds are light will have lost their souls and will abide in Hell. The fire will burn their faces, and they will be in severe affliction. God will say, "Were not My signs recited to you, and you treated them as falsehood?" They will reply, "Our misfortune overwhelmed us, and we went astray. Our Lord, bring us out of this; if we return to evil, then we are truly wrongdoers." God will say, "Be driven into it and do not speak to Me." There was a group of My servants who prayed, "Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who show mercy." But you ridiculed them until you forgot My message while laughing at them. Today, I have rewarded them for their patience; they are the ones who have achieved bliss. God will ask, "How many years did you stay on earth?" They will say, "We stayed a day or part of a day; ask those who keep count." God will say, "You stayed but a little, if only you knew. Did you think We created you in jest and that you would not be brought back to Us?" Exalted be God, the True King. There is no god but Him, the Lord of the Throne of Honor. Whoever invokes another god besides God has no proof, and their reckoning is with their Lord. Disbelievers will not succeed. Say, "My Lord, forgive and have mercy, for You are the Best of those who show mercy." 

Chapter 24: The Light (Al-Noor)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This is a chapter We have revealed and made obligatory, with clear signs so you may take heed. The woman and man guilty of adultery or fornication should each be flogged with a hundred stripes. Do not let compassion move you in their case if you believe in God and the Last Day.Let a group of believers witness their punishment. An adulterer should only marry an adulteress or an idolatress, and an adulteress should only marry an adulterer or an idolater. This is forbidden to believers. If someone accuses honorable women without providing four witnesses, they should be flogged with eighty stripes and their testimony should never be accepted again, as they are wicked transgressors. However, if they repent and change their ways, God is forgiving and merciful. For those who accuse their spouses without any evidence except their own, their testimony can be accepted if they swear four times by God that they are telling the truth. The fifth oath should invoke God's curse on themselves if they are lying. This process can also be used by the accused spouse to avert punishment by swearing four times that the accusation is false and invoking God's wrath on themselves if the accuser is truthful. If it weren't for God's grace and mercy, a severe penalty would have befallen you for your hasty actions. Those who spread slander among believers will face a grievous penalty in this life and the Hereafter. God knows, and you do not. Believers should not follow Satan's footsteps, as he commands shameful and wrong actions. Without God's grace and mercy, none of you would be pure, but God purifies whom He pleases. God is all-hearing and all-knowing. Those blessed with grace and means should not swear against helping their kin, the needy, and those who have left their homes for God's cause. They should forgive and overlook, as they would want God to forgive them. God is forgiving and merciful. Those who slander chaste, believing women are cursed in this life and the Hereafter and will face a grievous penalty. On the Day of Judgment, people's tongues, hands, and feet will testify against them about their actions. On that day, God will give everyone their due, and they will realize that God is the ultimate truth. Impure women are for impure men, and pure women are for pure men. Those who are pure are not affected by what others say; they will receive forgiveness and honorable provisions. Believers, do not enter houses other than your own without permission and greeting those inside. If no one is home, do not enter until you have permission. If you are asked to leave, do so, as it is purer for you. God knows everything you do. It is not wrong to enter uninhabited houses that serve some purpose for you. God knows what you reveal and what you conceal. Tell believing men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty; this will make them purer. God is aware of all their actions. Tell believing women to lower their gaze, guard their modesty, and not display their beauty except what is apparent. They should cover their chests and not reveal their beauty except to their husbands, fathers, husbands' fathers, sons, husbands' sons, brothers, brothers' sons, sisters' sons, their women, their slaves, male attendants who lack vigor, or children who do not understand women's hidden aspects. They should not stamp their feet to reveal their hidden ornaments. All believers should turn to God to attain success. Marry those among you who are single or the virtuous ones among your slaves. If they are poor, God will provide for them out of His grace. God is all-encompassing and all-knowing. Those who cannot afford to marry should remain chaste until God provides for them. If your slaves seek a contract for freedom, grant it if you see any good in them and give them some of God's wealth. Do not force your slave girls into prostitution if they desire chastity. If they are compelled, God is forgiving and merciful to them. We have sent down clear revelations to you, examples from those who passed away before you, and admonitions for those who fear God. God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. His Light is like a niche with a lamp inside, the lamp enclosed in glass, shining like a brilliant star. It is lit from a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor the west, whose oil almost glows even without being touched by fire. Light upon light. God guides to His Light whom He wills and sets forth parables for people. God knows all things. In houses that God has permitted to be honored, His name is celebrated morning and evening. These are places where people are not distracted by trade or commerce from remembering God, performing regular prayers, and giving charity. They fear the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed. God will reward them for their best deeds and increase their rewards out of His grace. He provides for whom He wills without measure. For those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert, appearing as water to the thirsty but turning out to be nothing. They will find God there, who will settle their account swiftly. Their state is like deep darkness in a vast ocean, covered by waves and clouds, where they can hardly see their hands. Without God's light, there is no light. All beings in the heavens and on earth, including birds with outspread wings, celebrate God's praises. Each knows its mode of prayer and praise, and God is aware of all they do. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Him is the final return. God moves the clouds gently, then joins them together, forming heaps from which rain emerges. He sends down hail from the sky, striking whom He wills and turning it away from whom He wills. The flash of His lightning almost blinds the sight. God alternates night and day, providing a lesson for those who see. God has created every living creature from water. Some creep on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some on four. God creates what He wills and has power over all things. He has sent down clear signs, guiding whom He wills to a straight path. Some people say they believe in God and His messenger and claim to obey, but then they turn away. They are not true believers. When summoned to God and His messenger for judgment, some decline to come. If the right is on their side, they come willingly. Is there a disease in their hearts, or do they doubt, or fear that God and His messenger will be unjust? No, they are the wrongdoers. True believers respond to God and His messenger by saying, "We hear and we obey," and they are the successful ones. Those who obey God and His messenger, fear God, and do right will be victorious. Some swear their strongest oaths by God that if commanded, they would leave their homes. Say, "Do not swear; obedience is more reasonable. God is well aware of what you do." Don't swear; reasonable obedience is what is desired. God knows what you do. Say: 'Obey God and the Messenger. If you turn away, he is only responsible for his duty, and you for yours. If you obey him, you will be rightly guided. The Messenger's duty is only to convey the clear message.' God has promised those who believe and do good deeds that He will grant them authority on earth, just as He did for those before them. He will establish their religion and replace their fear with security. They will worship Him alone and not associate anything with Him. Those who reject faith after this are rebellious. Establish regular prayer, give charity, and obey the Messenger so that you may receive mercy. Don't think that disbelievers can escape God's plan on earth; their abode is the Fire, a terrible refuge. Believers, let those under your care and children who haven't reached puberty ask for permission to enter your presence at three times: before morning prayer, during midday rest, and after night prayer. These are your times of privacy. Outside these times, it is not wrong for you or them to move about attending to each other. God makes His signs clear to you; He is full of knowledge and wisdom. When children reach puberty, let them ask for permission as those before them did. God makes His signs clear to you; He is full of knowledge and wisdom. Elderly women past the prospect of marriage can lay aside their outer garments without showing off their beauty, but it is better for them to be modest. God sees and knows all things. There is no blame on the blind, the lame, the sick, or yourselves if you eat in your own houses or those of your relatives or friends. There is no sin whether you eat together or separately. When you enter houses, greet each other with a greeting of blessing and purity from God. God makes His signs clear to you so that you may understand. True believers believe in God and His Messenger. When they are with him on a matter requiring collective action, they do not leave without asking for his permission. Those who ask for permission believe in God and His Messenger. If they ask for leave for some business, give permission to those you will and ask God for their forgiveness. God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Do not consider the Messenger's summons among yourselves like a call to one another. God knows those who slip away under some excuse. Let those who oppose the Messenger's order beware, lest a trial or a grievous penalty befall them. Do not treat the Messenger's call to you as if it were just any ordinary call. God knows those who sneak away, hiding themselves. Let those who oppose his orders be cautious, lest they face a trial or a severe punishment. Remember, everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God. He knows your intentions and actions. One day, you will be brought back to Him, and He will reveal the truth of what you did. God is all-knowing. 

Chapter 25: AL-FURQAN (THE CRITERION)

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion to His servant, as a warning to all people. He owns the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He has no son and no partner in His rule. He created everything and determined its measure. Yet, people have taken other gods besidesThey said, "These are just ancient tales he has written down, and they are read to him morning and evening." Say, "The Qur'an was sent down by Him who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. He is always Forgiving and Merciful." They say, "What kind of messenger is this who eats food and walks in the markets? Why hasn't an angel been sent down to him to warn with him?" Or, "Why hasn't a treasure been given to him, or why doesn't he have a garden to enjoy?" The wicked say, "You are following a man who is bewitched." See what kinds of comparisons they make for you! They have gone astray and cannot find the right path. Blessed is He who, if He wills, can give you better things than these—gardens with rivers flowing beneath and palaces to live in. But they deny the Hour (of Judgment). For those who deny the Hour, We have prepared a blazing fire. When it sees them from a distance, they will hear its fury and raging sigh. When they are thrown into a narrow place in it, chained together, they will plead for destruction. They will be told, "Do not plead for one destruction, but plead for many destructions!" Say, "Is that better, or the eternal garden promised to the righteous? That will be their reward and destination. They will have everything they desire there, living forever. This is a promise from your Lord that must be fulfilled." On the day He gathers them and those they worship besides God, He will ask, "Was it you who led these My servants astray, or did they stray from the path themselves?" They will say, "Glory to You! It was not for us to take any protectors besides You. But You gave them and their fathers good things until they forgot the message and became lost." God will say, "Now they have proven you liars in what you say. You cannot avert the penalty nor get help." And whoever among you does wrong, We will make him taste a severe punishment. The messengers We sent before you were all men who ate food and walked through the streets. We have always sent messengers who ate food and walked in the markets. We made some of you a test for others to see if you would be patient. Your Lord sees everything. Those who don't fear meeting Us say, "Why aren't angels sent to us, or why don't we see our Lord?" They are arrogant and insolent. On the day they see the angels, there will be no joy for the sinners. The angels will say, "There is a barrier forbidden to you." We will turn their deeds into scattered dust. The companions of the Garden will have a better place to stay and rest. On the day the heavens are split with clouds and angels descend, the true dominion will belong to the Most Merciful. It will be a hard day for disbelievers. The wrongdoer will bite his hands and say, "I wish I had taken the right path with the Messenger! Woe to me! I wish I hadn't taken that person as a friend! He led me astray from the message after it had come to me. Satan is a traitor to man." The Messenger will say, "O my Lord! My people have abandoned this Qur'an." We have made enemies for every prophet among the sinners, but your Lord is enough as a guide and helper. Those who reject faith say, "Why isn't the Qur'an revealed all at once?" We revealed it gradually to strengthen your heart. They bring arguments, but We reveal the truth and the best explanation. Those who will be gathered to Hell on their faces are in the worst plight and most astray. We gave Moses the Book and appointed his brother Aaron as his helper. We commanded them to go to the people who rejected Our signs, and We destroyed those people completely. The people of Noah, when they rejected the messengers, were drowned and made a sign for mankind. We have prepared a grievous penalty for wrongdoers. We also destroyed 'Ad, Thamud, the Companions of the Rass, and many generations between them. We set forth parables and examples for each, and each was utterly annihilated. The unbelievers must have passed by the town that was rained with evil. Did they not see it? They do not fear the Resurrection. When they see you, they mock, saying, "Is this the one whom God has sent as a messenger?" They almost led us away from our gods if we hadn't been steadfast. They will know who is most misled when they see the penalty. Have you seen the one who takes his own desires as his god? Can you be a guardian over him? Most of them do not listen or understand; they are like cattle, but even more astray. Have you not seen how your Lord extends the shadow? If He wanted, He could make it stay still, but He made the sun its guide. Then, He gradually draws it back to Himself. He is the One who made the night a covering for you, sleep a rest, and the day a time to rise again. He sends the winds as good news before His mercy, and He sends down pure water from the sky to give life to a dead land and to quench the thirst of many creatures, including humans and animals. We distribute the water among them so they may remember and be grateful, but most people are ungrateful. If We wanted, We could have sent a warner to every town. So, do not obey the disbelievers but strive against them with the Qur'an. He is the One who let the two seas flow freely, one sweet and palatable, the other salty and bitter, and He placed a barrier between them. He created humans from water and established relationships of lineage and marriage. Yet, they worship things besides God that can neither benefit nor harm them. The disbeliever is always against his Lord. We sent you, Muhammad, only to give good news and warnings. Say, 'I ask no reward from you except that whoever wills may take a path to his Lord.' Trust in the Ever-Living who never dies and celebrate His praise. He is fully aware of His servants' faults. He created the heavens and the earth and everything in between in six days and is firmly established on the Throne. When it is said to them, 'Prostrate to the Most Gracious,' they ask, 'What is the Most Gracious?' and it increases their aversion. Blessed is He who made constellations in the sky and placed a lamp and a moon giving light. He made the night and day follow each other for those who wish to remember or be grateful. The servants of the Most Gracious walk on the earth humbly, and when the ignorant address them, they say, 'Peace.' They spend the night in adoration of their Lord, prostrating and standing. They pray, 'Our Lord, avert from us the punishment of Hell, for its punishment is a grievous affliction. It is an evil abode and place to rest.' They are neither extravagant nor stingy when they spend but hold a just balance. They do not invoke any other god besides God, do not kill unjustly, and do not commit fornication. Whoever does this will face punishment, but those who repent, believe, and do righteous deeds will have their evil deeds changed into good by God, who is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Those who repent, believe, and do good deeds will have their past wrongs transformed into good deeds by God, who is always forgiving and merciful. Whoever repents and does good has truly turned to God with sincere repentance. Those who avoid falsehood and pass by frivolity with dignity, and who, when reminded of their Lord's signs, do not ignore them, are praised. They pray for righteous spouses and offspring, and for the strength to lead a righteous life. These individuals will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven for their patience and will be greeted with peace. Say to the disbelievers: "My Lord would not care for you if you did not call on Him, but since you have rejected the truth, judgment will come." 

Chapter 26: The Poets

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. These are verses of the clear Book. You may grieve that they do not believe. If We willed, We could send down a sign from the sky that would force them to believe. But whenever a new message comes from the Most Gracious, they turn away. They have rejected the truth, but soon they will know the reality of what they mocked. Do they not see how many noble things We have produced on the earth? There is a sign in this, but most do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. When your Lord called Moses, saying, "Go to the wrongdoing people, the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear God?" Moses said, "My Lord, I fear they will deny me, and my chest will tighten, and my speech will not be fluent. So, send Aaron with me. They also have a charge against me, and I fear they may kill me." God said, "By no means! Go, both of you, with Our signs. We are with you, listening." "Go to Pharaoh and say, 'We are messengers from the Lord of the worlds. Let the Children of Israel go with us.'" Pharaoh said, "Did we not raise you among us as a child? And you stayed with us for many years. And you did that deed of yours, and you are ungrateful." Moses said, "I did it when I was astray. So, I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord granted me wisdom and made me one of the messengers. And is this the favor you remind me of, that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?" Pharaoh asked, "What is the Lord of the worlds?" Moses replied, "The Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, if you are certain." Pharaoh said to those around him, "Do you not hear?" Moses continued, "Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers." Pharaoh said, "Your messenger who has been sent to you is surely mad." Moses said, "The Lord of the East and the West and everything between them, if you understand." Pharaoh said, "If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly imprison you!" Moses replied, "Even if I show you something clear and convincing?" Pharaoh challenged, "Show it then, if you are truthful!" So...Moses threw his staff, and it turned into a visible serpent. He also drew out his hand, and it appeared white to all onlookers. Pharaoh said to his chiefs, "This is indeed a skilled magician. His plan is to drive you out of your land with his magic. What do you advise?" They suggested, "Keep him and his brother in suspense and send heralds to gather all the skilled magicians." So the magicians were gathered on an appointed day, and the people were told to assemble. The magicians asked Pharaoh, "Will we have a reward if we win?" Pharaoh assured them, "Yes, and you will be close to me." Moses then said to them, "Throw what you are going to throw!" They threw their ropes and rods, claiming, "By Pharaoh's might, we will surely win!" But when Moses threw his staff, it swallowed up all their falsehoods. The magicians fell down in prostration, declaring, "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron." Pharaoh, furious, said, "You believe in Him before I give you permission? He must be your leader who taught you sorcery! I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you all!" The magicians responded, "No matter! We will return to our Lord. We hope our Lord will forgive our faults and make us among the foremost believers."

By inspiration, God told Moses, "Travel by night with My servants; you will be pursued." Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities, saying, "These Israelites are a small band, but they are enraged against us. We are a multitude, well-prepared." So they pursued the Israelites at sunrise. When the two groups saw each other, Moses' people said, "We are sure to be overtaken." Moses reassured them, "By no means! My Lord is with me; He will guide me." Then God inspired Moses to strike the sea with his staff. The sea parted, and each part became like a huge, firm mass. The Israelites crossed safely, but the pursuing Egyptians were drowned. This is a sign, but most do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

Recite to them the story of Abraham. He asked his father and his people, "What do you worship?" They replied, "We worship idols and are devoted to them." Abraham questioned, "Do they listen to you when you call on them? Can they benefit or harm you?" They replied, "No, but we follow what our ancestors did." Abraham said, "Do you see what you and your ancestors have been worshipping? They are enemies to me, except the Lord of the Worlds, who created me and guides me, who gives me food and drink, and who heals me when I am sick. He will cause me to die and then bring me back to life, and I hope He will forgive my faults on the Day of Judgment." Abraham prayed, "O my Lord, grant me wisdom and join me with the righteous. Give me an honorable mention among later generations and make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss. Forgive my father, for he is among those who have gone astray. Do not disgrace me on the Day when everyone will be raised up, the Day when neither wealth nor children will be of any benefit, except for those who come to God with a pure heart."

On that Day, the Garden will be brought near to the righteous, and Hell will be in full view of those who went astray. It will be said to them, "Where are the gods you used to worship besides God? Can they help you or help themselves?" They will be thrown into the Fire, along with those who led them astray and the followers of Iblis. They will argue among themselves, saying, "By God, we were clearly in error when we equated you with the Lord of the Worlds. It was the guilty ones who misled us. Now we have no intercessors or any true friends. If only we could return to life, we would be among the believers." Indeed, there is a sign in this, but most people do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

The people of Noah rejected the messengers. When their brother Noah said to them, "Will you not fear God? I am a trustworthy messenger to you, so fear God and obey me. I do not ask you for any reward; my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. So fear God and obey me." They said, "Should we believe in you when the lowest people follow you?" Noah replied, "What do I know about what they do? Their account is only with my Lord, if you could understand. I am not here to drive away the believers; I am only a plain warner." They threatened, "If you do not stop, O Noah, you will be stoned to death." Noah prayed, "O my Lord, my people have rejected me. Judge between me and them openly, and deliver me and the believers with me." So We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned the rest. Indeed, there is a sign in this, but most people do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

The people of 'Ad rejected the messengers. When their brother Hud said to them, "Will you not fear God? I am a trustworthy messenger to you, so fear God and obey me. I do not ask for any reward; my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. So fear God and obey me." Hud continued, "I don't ask for any reward from you; my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Do you build monuments on every high place just for show? Do you construct strong buildings hoping to live forever? When you act, do you do so with absolute power like tyrants? Fear God and obey me. Be mindful of Him who has given you all that you know, including cattle, children, gardens, and springs. I fear for you the punishment of a Great Day." They responded, "It doesn't matter whether you warn us or not; this is just an old tradition. We won't be punished." So they rejected him, and We destroyed them. Indeed, there is a sign in this, but most people do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

The people of Thamud also rejected the messengers. Their brother Salih said to them, "Will you not fear God? I am a trustworthy messenger to you, so fear God and obey me. I don't ask for any reward from you; my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Will you be left secure in your gardens, springs, fields, and palm trees? You carve houses out of mountains with great skill. But fear God and obey me. Do not follow those who are extravagant and spread corruption in the land." They said, "You are just one of the bewitched. You are a mortal like us. Bring us a sign if you are truthful." Salih said, "Here is a she-camel; she has the right to drink, and you have the right to drink on appointed days. Do not harm her, or the punishment of a Great Day will seize you." But they hamstrung her and regretted it. The punishment seized them. Indeed, there is a sign in this, but most people do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

The people of Lot also rejected the messengers. Their brother Lot said to them, "Will you not fear God? I am a trustworthy messenger to you, so fear God and obey me. I don't ask for any reward from you; my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Do you approach males and leave the wives your Lord created for you? You are a people exceeding limits." They said, "If you don't stop, Lot, you will be cast out." Lot replied, "I detest your actions. My Lord, save me and my family from what they do." So We saved him and his family, except an old woman who stayed behind. Then We destroyed the rest and rained down on them a shower of brimstone. Indeed, there is a sign in this, but most people do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

The people of Midian also denied the messengers. Shu'aib said to them, "Will you not fear God? I am a trustworthy messenger to you, so fear God and obey me. I don't ask for any reward from you; my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Give just measure and do not cheat others. Weigh with accurate scales and do not withhold what is due to people. Do not commit evil or spread corruption in the land. Fear Him who created you and the generations before you." They replied, "You are just one of the bewitched. You are a mortal like us, and we think you are a liar. If you are truthful, make a piece of the sky fall on us." Shu'aib said, "My Lord knows best what you do." But they rejected him, and the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them. Indeed, there is a sign in this, but most people do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

This is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds, brought down by the Faithful Spirit to your heart, so you may warn in clear Arabic language. It is also mentioned in the scriptures of former peoples. Is it not a sign to them that the learned among the Children of Israel recognize it? If We had revealed it to a non-Arab and he had recited it to them, they would not have believed in it. Thus, We make it enter the hearts of the guilty. They will not believe in it until they see the grievous punishment, which will come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive it. Then they will say, "Can we be given more time?" Do they wish to hasten Our punishment? Have you considered if We let them enjoy themselves for years, and then the punishment they were promised comes to them, it will not benefit them at all. We never destroyed a population without sending its warners as a reminder, and We are never unjust. The devils did not bring down this revelation; it is not suitable for them, nor are they able to do so. They are far removed from even hearing it. So do not call upon any other god with God, or you will be among those punished. Warn your nearest relatives and be kind to the believers who follow you. If they disobey you, say, "I am free of what you do." Put your trust in the Mighty, the Merciful, who sees you when you stand up to pray and your movements among those who prostrate themselves. He is the Hearer, the Knower. Shall I inform you on whom the devils descend? They descend on every lying, wicked person who listens eagerly, but most of them are liars. As for poets, the erring follow them. Do you not see that they wander distracted in every valley and say what they do not do?The people of Midian also rejected the messengers. Shu'aib told them, "Won't you fear God? I am a trustworthy messenger to you, so fear God and obey me. I don't ask for any reward from you; my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Give fair measure and don't cheat others. Weigh with accurate scales and don't withhold what is due to people. Don't commit evil or spread corruption in the land. Fear Him who created you and the generations before you." They replied, "You are just one of the bewitched. You are a mortal like us, and we think you are a liar. If you are truthful, make a piece of the sky fall on us." Shu'aib said, "My Lord knows best what you do." But they rejected him, and the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them. Indeed, there is a sign in this, but most people do not believe. Your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

Except those who believe, work righteousness, remember God often, and defend themselves after they are wronged. Those who do wrong will soon know what a great reversal they will face! But those who believe, do good works, remember God much, and defend themselves after being wronged will be saved. Those who act unjustly will know to what final place they will turn back.

Chapter 27: AL-NAML (THE ANT, THE ANTS)
Total Verses: 93
Revealed At: Mecca

In the name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. These are verses of the Qur'an, a book that makes things clear; a guide and glad tidings for the believers, who establish regular prayers, give in regular charity, and have full assurance of the hereafter. As for those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have made their deeds pleasing in their eyes, so they wander about in distraction. They will face a grievous penalty, and in the hereafter, they will be the greatest losers. As for you, the Qur'an is bestowed upon you from the presence of One who is Wise and All-Knowing.

Remember when Moses said to his family, "I perceive a fire; soon I will bring you some information or a burning brand to light our fuel, so you may warm yourselves." But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard: "Blessed are those in the fire and those around it. Glory to God, the Lord of the Worlds! O Moses! Verily, I am God, the Exalted in Might, the Wise!" "Now throw your rod!" But when he saw it moving like a snake, he turned back in retreat and did not return. "O Moses! Fear not; truly, in My presence, messengers have no fear. But if anyone has done wrong and then substituted good for evil, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." "Now put your hand into your bosom, and it will come forth white without harm. These are among the nine signs you will take to Pharaoh and his people, for they are a rebellious people." But when Our signs came to them, they said, "This is sorcery manifest!" And they rejected those signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their souls were convinced of them. So see what was the end of those who acted corruptly!

We gave knowledge to David and Solomon, and they both said, "Praise be to God, Who has favored us above many of His believing servants!" Solomon was David's heir and said, "O people! We have been taught the speech of birds, and on us has been bestowed a little of all things. This is indeed a manifest grace from God." Solomon's armies of jinn, men, and birds were gathered before him, and they were kept in order and ranks. When they came to a valley of ants, one of the ants said, "O ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you without knowing it." Solomon smiled, amused at her speech, and said, "O my Lord! Order me to be grateful for Your favors, which You have bestowed on me and my parents, and to do righteousness that will please You. Admit me, by Your grace, to the ranks of Your righteous servants."

He took a muster of the birds and said, "Why do I not see the hoopoe? Is he among the absentees? I will certainly punish him severely or execute him unless he brings me a clear reason for his absence." But the hoopoe did not tarry long and said, "I have discovered something you do not know. I come to you from Sheba with true tidings. I found a woman ruling over them, provided with every requisite, and she has a magnificent throne." "I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given everything, including a magnificent throne. I saw her and her people worshipping the sun instead of God. Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing to them and has led them away from the right path, so they are not guided. They do not worship God, who reveals what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you hide and what you reveal. God, there is no god but Him, the Lord of the Tremendous Throne."

Solomon said, "We will see if you are telling the truth or lying. Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then step back and see what they respond." The Queen of Sheba said, "O chiefs! A noble letter has been delivered to me. It is from Solomon, and it says, 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Do not be arrogant against me, but come to me in submission.'" She asked her chiefs for advice, saying she never makes a decision without consulting them. They replied, "We are strong and ready for war, but the decision is yours, so consider what you will command." She said, "When kings enter a country, they ruin it and make the noblest of its people the lowest. But I will send him a gift and see what response my messengers bring back."

When the messengers came to Solomon, he said, "Do you offer me wealth? What God has given me is better than what He has given you. You are the ones who rejoice in your gift. Go back to them. We will come to them with forces they cannot resist, and we will drive them out in disgrace, and they will be humbled." Solomon then asked his chiefs, "Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?" An 'Ifrit among the jinn said, "I will bring it to you before you rise from your council. I am strong and trustworthy for this task." Another who had knowledge of the Book said, "I will bring it to you in the blink of an eye." When Solomon saw the throne placed before him, he said, "This is by the grace of my Lord, to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful, it is for their own good, and whoever is ungrateful, my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Supreme in Honor."

Solomon then said, "Disguise her throne so we may see if she recognizes it or if she is not rightly guided." When she arrived, she was asked, "Is this your throne?" She replied, "It looks like it." Solomon said, "We were given knowledge before her, and we have submitted to God." What she worshipped besides God had hindered her, for she came from a disbelieving people. She was then asked to enter the palace. When she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and bared her legs. Solomon said, "It is a hall made smooth with glass." She said, "My Lord! I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to God, the Lord of the Worlds."

We sent to the Thamud their brother Salih, urging them to worship God. However, they split into two opposing groups. Salih asked them, "Why do you seek evil over good? Ask God for forgiveness so you may receive mercy." They blamed their misfortunes on Salih and his followers, but he told them their fate was determined by God and that they were being tested. In the city, there were nine men who caused trouble and refused to reform. They plotted to attack Salih and his family at night and then deny any involvement. However, God also had a plan, and they were unaware of it. Ultimately, their plot led to their own destruction, leaving their homes in ruins as a sign for those who understand. God saved those who believed and practiced righteousness.

Lot was also sent as a messenger, warning his people against committing shameful acts. He questioned why they pursued men instead of women, calling them ignorant. The people wanted to expel Lot and his followers for wanting to remain pure. God saved Lot and his family, except his wife.Pharaoh and his followers were arrogant and unjust, thinking they would not be held accountable. So, We seized them and threw them into the sea. Look at the fate of those who did wrong! We made them leaders who invite to the Fire, and on the Day of Judgment, they will find no help. In this world, they were followed by a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection, they will be among the despised. We revealed the Book to Moses after destroying earlier generations, to provide insight, guidance, and mercy so that people might take heed. You (Muhammad) were not on the western side when We decreed the command to Moses, nor were you among the witnesses. But We raised many generations, and their lives prolonged. You were not dwelling among the people of Midian, reciting Our verses to them, but We were sending messengers. Nor were you at the side of Mount Tur when We called out to Moses. But it is a mercy from your Lord so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, that they may remember. Otherwise, if a disaster should strike them for what their hands have sent forth, they might say, "Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could follow Your signs and be among the believers?" But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "Why has he not been given the like of what was given to Moses?" Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before? They said, "Two kinds of magic supporting each other," and they said, "We disbelieve in both." Say, "Then bring a Book from God which is a better guide than these two, that I may follow it, if you are truthful." But if they do not respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from God? Indeed, God does not guide the wrongdoing people. We have conveyed the Word to them so they may remember. Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it believe in it. When it is recited to them, they say, "We believe in it. Indeed, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, we were Muslims before it." They will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and because they repel evil with good and spend from what We have provided them. When they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, "For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. Peace be upon you; we seek not the ignorant." Indeed, you do not guide whom you like, but God guides whom He wills, and He is most knowing of the rightly guided. They say, "If we were to follow the guidance with you, we would be swept from our land." Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from Us? But most of them do not know. And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in its way of living, and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly. And it is We who were the inheritors. And your Lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were reformers. And if your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind one community; but they will not cease to differ, except whom your Lord has given mercy, and for that He created them. But the word of your Lord is to be fulfilled that, "I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together." And each story We relate to you from the news of the messengers is that by which We make firm your heart. And there has come to you, in this, the truth and an instruction and a reminder for the believers. Say to those who do not believe, "Work according to your position; indeed, we are working. And wait; indeed, we are waiting." And to God belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and to Him will be returned the matter, all of it, so worship Him and rely upon Him. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do.
