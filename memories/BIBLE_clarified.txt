**The Old Testament: Genesis**

**Chapter 1: The Creation**

1. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
2. The earth was formless and empty, with darkness over the deep waters, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
3. God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
4. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
5. God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." There was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

6. God said, "Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water."
7. So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.
8. God called the vault "sky." There was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

9. God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.
10. God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters He called "seas." And God saw that it was good.
11. Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.
12. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
13. There was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

14. God said, "Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,
15. and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so.
16. God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
17. God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,
18. to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
19. There was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.

20. God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky."
21. So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
22. God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."
23. There was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

24. God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.
25. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

26. Then God said, "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."
27. So God created mankind in His own image, in the image of God He created them; male and female He created them.
28. God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground."
29. Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
30. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food." And it was so.
31. God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. There was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.

**Chapter 2: The Seventh Day, God Rests**

1. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
2. By the seventh day, God had finished the work He had been doing; so on the seventh day, He rested from all His work.
3. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it He rested from all the work of creating that He had done.

**Chapter 2: The Creation of Man and Woman**

4. This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.
5. Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground,
6. but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
7. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

8. Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there He put the man He had formed.
9. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
10. A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.
11. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
12. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.)
13. The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.
14. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

15. The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
16. And the Lord God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;
17. but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die."

18. The Lord God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
19. Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
20. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky, and all the wild animals. But for Adam, no suitable helper was found.
21. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, He took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.
22. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib He had taken out of the man, and He brought her to the man.
23. The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man."
24. That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.
25. Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

**Chapter 3: The Fall**

1. Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
2. The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,
3. but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"
4. "You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman.
5. "For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
6. When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
7. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

8. Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as He was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
9. But the Lord God called to the man, "Where are you?"
10. He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."
11. And He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
12. The man said, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."
13. Then the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."

14. So the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
15. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."

16. To the woman He said, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."

17. To Adam He said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.
18. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
19. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."God told Adam, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree I commanded you not to eat from, the ground is cursed because of you. You will have to work hard all your life to get food from it. It will produce thorns and thistles, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food until you return to the ground, for from it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you will return."

Adam named his wife Eve because she would become the mother of all the living. The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. Then the Lord God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever." So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. After He drove the man out, He placed cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.

Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Abel. Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. In time, Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord, and Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering, He did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.

Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."

Cain said to Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"

The Lord said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."

Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."

But the Lord said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. So Cain went out from the Lord's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

Cain had a wife, and she gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. Enoch had a son named Irad, who was the father of Mehujael. Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. His brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.

Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."

Adam and Eve had another son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him." Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time, people began to call on the name of the Lord.

This is the written account of Adam's family line. When God created mankind, He made them in the likeness of God. He created them male and female and blessed them. And He named them "Mankind" when they were created. When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image, and he named him Seth. After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.

Seth lived 105 years and became the father of Enosh. After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.

Enosh lived 90 years and became the father of Kenan. After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.

Kenan lived 70 years and became the father of Mahalalel. After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.

Mahalalel lived 65 years and became the father of Jared. After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.

Jared lived 162 years and became the father of Enoch. After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.

Enoch lived 65 years and became the father of Methuselah. After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more because God took him away.

Methuselah lived 187 years and became the father of Lamech. After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.

Lamech lived 182 years and had a son. He named him Noah and said, "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed." After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.

After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. Then the Lord said, "My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be 120 years."

The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.

The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The Lord regretted that He had made human beings on the earth, and His heart was deeply troubled. So the Lord said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds, and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them." But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle, and upper decks. I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal, and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive."Noah was instructed by God to bring pairs of every kind of animal into the ark to keep them alive. He was also told to gather enough food for his family and the animals. Noah did everything as God commanded.

God then told Noah to enter the ark with his family because He found Noah righteous. Noah was to take seven pairs of every clean animal and one pair of every unclean animal, as well as seven pairs of every kind of bird, to ensure their survival. God warned that in seven days, He would send rain for forty days and nights to destroy all living things on earth.

Noah, who was 600 years old at the time, entered the ark with his family and the animals. After seven days, the floodwaters came. The rain fell for forty days and nights, and the waters rose, lifting the ark high above the earth. The floodwaters covered even the highest mountains by more than twenty feet. Every living thing on land perished, except for Noah and those with him in the ark. The floodwaters remained for 150 days.

God remembered Noah and all the animals in the ark. He sent a wind to recede the waters, and the rain stopped. After 150 days, the waters began to go down, and the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. The waters continued to recede, and by the tenth month, the tops of the mountains were visible.

After forty more days, Noah sent out a raven, which flew back and forth until the waters dried up. He then sent out a dove, but it found no place to rest and returned to the ark. After seven days, Noah sent the dove out again, and it returned with an olive leaf, indicating the waters had receded. He waited another seven days and sent the dove out again, and it did not return.

In the 601st year of Noah's life, the waters dried up. God told Noah to leave the ark with his family and the animals so they could multiply on the earth. Noah built an altar and offered sacrifices to God, who promised never to curse the ground again or destroy all living things as He had done.

God blessed Noah and his sons, telling them to be fruitful and multiply. He established a covenant with them, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again. The rainbow was given as a sign of this covenant.

Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, repopulated the earth. Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard. One day, he became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent. Ham saw his father's nakedness and told his brothers, who covered Noah without looking at him. When Noah awoke, he cursed Ham's son Canaan and blessed Shem and Japheth.

Noah lived 350 years after the flood, reaching a total of 950 years before he died.Noah lived for 950 years and then passed away. 

After the flood, Noah's sons—Shem, Ham, and Japheth—had children. Japheth's descendants included Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. Gomer's sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. Javan's sons were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. These families spread out into their own lands, each with its own language and nation.

Ham's descendants were Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. Cush's sons included Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah. Raamah's sons were Sheba and Dedan. Cush also fathered Nimrod, who became a mighty hunter and established his kingdom in Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh in Shinar. From there, Asshur went out and built Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen, which became a great city. Mizraim's descendants included Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim. Canaan's descendants included Sidon (his firstborn), Heth, and the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. The Canaanite families spread out, with their territory extending from Sidon to Gerar, Gaza, Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Lasha.

Shem, the ancestor of all the children of Eber and the brother of Japheth, had children too. Shem's descendants included Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. Aram's sons were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Arphaxad fathered Salah, who fathered Eber. Eber had two sons: Peleg (named because the earth was divided in his time) and Joktan. Joktan's sons included Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. They lived from Mesha to Sephar in the eastern mountains. These were the families of Shem, each with its own language and nation.

The whole earth initially had one language. As people moved eastward, they settled in Shinar and decided to build a city and a tower reaching to the heavens to make a name for themselves and avoid being scattered. God saw their city and tower and decided to confuse their language so they couldn't understand each other. This led to the people being scattered across the earth, and the city was named Babel because of the confusion of languages.

Shem's lineage continued with Arphaxad, who fathered Salah, who fathered Eber. Eber's son Peleg fathered Reu, who fathered Serug, who fathered Nahor, who fathered Terah. Terah had three sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran fathered Lot but died in Ur of the Chaldees, his birthplace. Abram and Nahor married; Abram's wife was Sarai, and Nahor's wife was Milcah, Haran's daughter. Sarai was barren and had no children.

Terah took Abram, Lot, and Sarai from Ur to go to Canaan but settled in Haran, where he died at 205 years old. God told Abram to leave his country and family for a land He would show him, promising to make Abram a great nation and bless him. Abram obeyed, taking Sarai, Lot, and all their possessions to Canaan. They traveled through the land to Sichem and the plain of Moreh, where God promised the land to Abram's descendants. Abram built an altar there and then moved to a mountain east of Bethel, where he built another altar and called on the Lord.

A famine forced Abram to go to Egypt. Fearing for his life because of Sarai's beauty, he asked her to say she was his sister. Pharaoh's officials saw Sarai and took her to Pharaoh's house, treating Abram well for her sake. But God plagued Pharaoh's house because of Sarai, leading Pharaoh to confront Abram. Pharaoh returned Sarai and sent them away with all their possessions.

Abram left Egypt with Sarai, Lot, and all their wealth, traveling back to Bethel, where he had first built an altar and called on the Lord. Abram and Lot had so much livestock that the land couldn't support them both, leading to conflicts between their herdsmen.Abram and Lot had so much livestock that the land couldn't support them both, leading to conflicts between their herdsmen. Abram suggested they separate to avoid strife, offering Lot the choice of land. Lot chose the well-watered plain of Jordan and moved east, while Abram stayed in Canaan. God then promised Abram that all the land he could see would belong to his descendants forever, and they would be as numerous as the dust of the earth. Abram moved to Hebron and built an altar to the Lord.

During this time, several kings, including Chedorlaomer of Elam, waged war against the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities. After twelve years of serving Chedorlaomer, these cities rebelled. In the ensuing battle, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and their cities were plundered. Lot, who lived in Sodom, was captured along with his possessions.

When Abram heard that Lot had been taken, he gathered 318 trained men from his household and pursued the captors. He divided his forces and attacked at night, rescuing Lot and recovering all the goods and people taken. After the victory, Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, blessed Abram and offered him bread and wine. Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.

The king of Sodom offered Abram the recovered goods, but Abram refused, not wanting anyone to say they had made him rich. Instead, he allowed his allies to take their share.

Later, God appeared to Abram in a vision, promising to be his shield and great reward. Abram expressed concern about being childless, but God assured him that his own offspring would be his heir. God took Abram outside and told him to count the stars, promising that his descendants would be just as numerous. Abram believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.

God then made a covenant with Abram, promising him the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates. He instructed Abram to prepare a sacrifice, and as Abram fell into a deep sleep, God revealed that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land for 400 years but would eventually return with great wealth. A smoking firepot and a blazing torch passed between the pieces of the sacrifice, symbolizing God's covenant with Abram.

Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne any children, so she gave her Egyptian maid, Hagar, to Abram as a wife. Hagar conceived, but this caused tension between her and Sarai. Hagar fled, but an angel of the Lord found her and instructed her to return and submit to Sarai. The angel promised that Hagar's descendants would be too numerous to count and that she would bear a son named Ishmael. Hagar returned and bore Abram a son when he was 86 years old.

When Abram was 99, the Lord appeared to him again, reaffirming His covenant and promising to multiply Abram's descendants.God spoke to Abram, saying, "My covenant is with you, and you will be the father of many nations. Your name will no longer be Abram but Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you very fruitful; nations and kings will come from you. I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants. I will give you and your descendants the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession, and I will be their God."

God continued, "You must keep my covenant, you and your descendants. Every male among you must be circumcised as a sign of the covenant. This includes those born in your household or bought with money. Any uncircumcised male will be cut off from his people for breaking my covenant."

God also said, "Your wife Sarai will now be called Sarah. I will bless her and give you a son by her. She will be the mother of nations, and kings will come from her." Abraham laughed and thought, "Can a child be born to a man who is 100 years old? Can Sarah bear a child at 90?" He said to God, "If only Ishmael could live under your blessing!" But God replied, "Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him and his descendants. As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will bless him, make him fruitful, and greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. But my covenant will be with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year."

God finished speaking and left Abraham. Abraham then circumcised his son Ishmael and all the males in his household, as God had commanded. Abraham was 99 years old, and Ishmael was 13 when they were circumcised.

One day, the Lord appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre. Abraham was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day when he saw three men standing nearby. He hurried to meet them and bowed low to the ground. He said, "If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass by your servant. Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. Let me get you something to eat so you can be refreshed and then go on your way." The men agreed.

Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quick, get three measures of the finest flour and bake some bread." Then he ran to the herd, selected a tender calf, and gave it to a servant who prepared it. He brought curds, milk, and the prepared calf and set these before the men. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.

The men asked, "Where is your wife Sarah?" Abraham replied, "There, in the tent." One of them said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son." Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself and thought, "After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?"

Then the Lord said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' Is anything too hard for the Lord? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son." Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, "I did not laugh." But he said, "Yes, you did laugh."

When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. Then the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him."

Then the Lord said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know."

The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the Lord. Abraham approached him and said, "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"

The Lord said, "If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake."

Then Abraham spoke up again: "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?" The Lord said, "If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it."

Once again he spoke to him, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it."

Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?" He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."

Abraham said, "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?" He said, "For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it."

Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?" He answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it."

When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.

Two angels arrived in Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. "My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning." "No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square." But Lot insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.

Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."

Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."

"Get out of our way," they replied. "This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.

The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here."The angels told Lot, "We are here to destroy this place because the outcry against its people has reached the Lord, and He has sent us to destroy it." Lot went to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, and said, "Get up and leave this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.

At dawn, the angels urged Lot, "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished." When Lot hesitated, the angels grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the Lord was merciful to them. As soon as they had brought them out, one of the angels said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!"

But Lot said to them, "No, my lords, please! Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared."

The angel said to him, "Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it." (That is why the town was called Zoar.)

By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord out of the heavens. Thus He overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land. But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.

Early the next morning, Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord. He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham, and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.

Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. One day, the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth. Let's get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father."

That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. The next day, the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I slept with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father." So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again, he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.

So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today. The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.

Abraham moved south to the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while, he stayed in Gerar. Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman."

Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands."

Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die."

Early the next morning, Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done." And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"

Abraham replied, "I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"

Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. And Abimelech said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like."

To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."

Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so they could have children again, for the Lord had kept all the women in Abimelech's household from conceiving because of Abraham's wife Sarah.

Now the Lord was gracious to Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what He had promised. Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him. When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.

Sarah said, "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me." And she added, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."

The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned, Abraham held a great feast. But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, and she said to Abraham, "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."

The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. But God said to him, "Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring."

Early the next morning, Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there, she began to sob.

God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."

Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.

At that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his forces, said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do. Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you."

Abraham said, "I swear it."

Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized. But Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today." So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty.Abraham set aside seven ewe lambs from his flock. Abimelech asked him, "Why have you set these seven ewe lambs apart?" Abraham replied, "These seven lambs are a witness that I dug this well." So, they named the place Beersheba because they both swore an oath there. They made a covenant at Beersheba, and then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, returned to the land of the Philistines. Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God. Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for many days.

Some time later, God tested Abraham. He called out to him, "Abraham!" and Abraham replied, "Here I am." God said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you." Early the next morning, Abraham got up, saddled his donkey, and took two of his servants and his son Isaac. He cut enough wood for the burnt offering and set out for the place God had told him about. On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. He told his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then come back to you."

Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on Isaac, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, Isaac spoke up and said, "Father?" Abraham replied, "Yes, my son?" Isaac asked, "The fire and wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.

When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied. "Do not lay a hand on the boy," the angel said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."

Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called that place "The Lord Will Provide." And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided."

The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time and said, "I swear by myself, declares the Lord, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, and through your offspring, all nations on earth will be blessed because you have obeyed me."

Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba, where Abraham stayed. 

After these events, Abraham was told that Milcah had also borne children to his brother Nahor: Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Nahor, Abraham's brother. His concubine, Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

Sarah lived to be 127 years old. She died in Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said, "I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead."

The Hittites replied to Abraham, "Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead." Abraham bowed down before the people of the land and said to them, "If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you."

Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people, and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. "No, my lord," he said. "Listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead."

Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land and he said to Ephron in their hearing, "Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there." Ephron answered Abraham, "Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."

Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants. So Ephron's field in Machpelah near Mamre—the field with its cave and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city. Afterward, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan. The field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.

Abraham was now very old, and the Lord had blessed him in every way. He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh. I want you to swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac."

The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?" "Make sure that you do not take my son back there," Abraham said. "The Lord, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land'—he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there." So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.

Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor. He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. Then he prayed, "Lord, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. May it be that when I say to a young woman, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too'—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this, I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."

Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor. The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again. The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar." "Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink." So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.The man watched her in silence, wondering if the Lord had made his journey successful. When the camels finished drinking, he gave her a gold earring and two gold bracelets. He asked, "Whose daughter are you? Is there room in your father's house for us to stay?" She replied, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor. We have plenty of straw and feed, and room to lodge." The man bowed and worshipped the Lord, thanking Him for leading him to his master's relatives. Rebekah ran to tell her family. Her brother Laban saw the jewelry and heard her story, so he went to the man at the well and invited him in, saying, "Come, blessed of the Lord. Why stand outside? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels." The man entered, unloaded the camels, and provided straw and water for them and for washing his feet and those of his men. Food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told my mission." Laban said, "Speak on."

The man explained, "I am Abraham's servant. The Lord has greatly blessed my master, making him wealthy with flocks, herds, silver, gold, servants, camels, and donkeys. Sarah, my master's wife, bore him a son in her old age, and he has given everything to him. My master made me swear not to take a wife for his son from the Canaanites but to go to his family and find a wife there. I asked what if the woman wouldn't come back with me, and he said the Lord would send His angel to make my journey successful. If she wouldn't come, I would be free from the oath. Today, I prayed at the well, asking the Lord to show me the right woman by her offering water to me and my camels. Before I finished praying, Rebekah came and did just that. When I asked her whose daughter she was, she said Bethuel's, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore. I gave her the jewelry and worshipped the Lord for leading me to my master's relatives. Now, if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; if not, let me know so I can decide what to do."

Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the Lord; we cannot say anything bad or good. Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the Lord has directed." When Abraham's servant heard this, he bowed to the ground and worshipped the Lord. He brought out silver, gold, and clothing, giving them to Rebekah and also precious gifts to her brother and mother. They ate, drank, and stayed the night. In the morning, he asked to be sent back to his master. Rebekah's family asked for her to stay ten more days, but he insisted on leaving immediately since the Lord had made his journey successful. They called Rebekah and asked if she would go with the man, and she agreed. They blessed her, saying, "Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands and may your descendants possess the gates of their enemies." Rebekah and her maids mounted the camels and followed the man.

Isaac was in the field meditating when he saw the camels approaching. Rebekah saw Isaac and asked the servant who he was. The servant replied, "He is my master." She covered herself with a veil. The servant told Isaac everything that had happened. Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent, and she became his wife. He loved her, and she comforted him after his mother's death.

Abraham took another wife, Keturah, who bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. These were the descendants of Keturah. Abraham gave everything he owned to Isaac but gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from Isaac to the east.

Abraham lived 175 years and died at a good old age, full of years. His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre, where Abraham had buried Sarah. After Abraham's death, God blessed Isaac, who lived near the well Lahairoi.

These are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian bore to Abraham. The names of Ishmael's sons, listed by their names and clans, are Nebajoth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These were the sons of Ishmael, and they became twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps. Ishmael lived 137 years, then died and was gathered to his people. His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, near Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. They lived in hostility toward all their relatives.

These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham fathered Isaac, who was 40 years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean. Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer, and Rebekah became pregnant. The babies jostled within her, and she asked the Lord why this was happening. The Lord said, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from within you. One people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger." When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys. The first came out red and hairy, and they named him Esau. His brother came out with his hand grasping Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.

The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents. Isaac loved Esau because he enjoyed eating the wild game Esau brought, but Rebekah loved Jacob. One day, Jacob was cooking some stew when Esau came in from the open country, famished. Esau said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!"Esau was also called Edom. Jacob then asked Esau to sell him his birthright. Esau, feeling like he was about to die from hunger, agreed, seeing no value in his birthright at that moment. Jacob made Esau swear to it, and Esau sold his birthright to Jacob. Jacob then gave Esau bread and lentil stew, which Esau ate and drank before leaving, showing his disregard for his birthright.

A famine struck the land, different from the one during Abraham's time. Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar. The Lord appeared to Isaac, instructing him not to go to Egypt but to stay in the land He would show him. God promised to bless Isaac and his descendants, giving them all these lands and fulfilling the oath He made to Abraham. God assured Isaac that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars and that all nations would be blessed through them because Abraham obeyed God's commands.

Isaac stayed in Gerar. When the men there asked about his wife, he said she was his sister, fearing they might kill him for Rebekah because she was beautiful. After a long time, Abimelech saw Isaac caressing Rebekah and realized she was his wife. Abimelech confronted Isaac, who admitted his fear of being killed. Abimelech rebuked Isaac, warning that someone might have taken Rebekah, bringing guilt upon them. Abimelech then ordered his people not to harm Isaac or his wife.

Isaac planted crops in that land and reaped a hundredfold because the Lord blessed him. He became very wealthy, with many flocks, herds, and servants, which made the Philistines envious. They filled all the wells that Abraham's servants had dug with earth. Abimelech asked Isaac to leave because he had become too powerful. Isaac moved to the Valley of Gerar and reopened the wells that had been dug during Abraham's time, naming them as his father had.

Isaac's servants found a well of fresh water in the valley, but the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, claiming the water. Isaac named the well Esek because of the dispute. They dug another well, and there was another quarrel, so he named it Sitnah. Isaac moved on and dug another well, and this time there was no quarrel. He named it Rehoboth, saying the Lord had given them room to flourish in the land.

Isaac went to Beersheba, where the Lord appeared to him that night, reaffirming His promise to bless and multiply Isaac's descendants for Abraham's sake. Isaac built an altar there, called on the Lord's name, and pitched his tent. His servants dug a well there.

Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar with his advisor Ahuzzath and the commander of his army, Phicol. Isaac asked why they came, given that they had sent him away. They replied that they saw the Lord was with Isaac and wanted to make a peace treaty, ensuring no harm would come to them. Isaac prepared a feast, and they ate and drank. The next morning, they swore an oath to each other, and Isaac sent them away in peace. That same day, Isaac's servants reported finding water, and he named the well Shebah, which is why the city is called Beersheba to this day.

Esau was 40 years old when he married Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite. These marriages were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.

When Isaac was old and his eyesight failing, he called Esau, his eldest son, and asked him to hunt some game and prepare a meal so that Isaac could bless him before he died. Rebekah overheard this and instructed Jacob to fetch two young goats so she could prepare a meal for Isaac, allowing Jacob to receive the blessing instead. Jacob was concerned that Isaac would recognize him as a deceiver because Esau was hairy and he was not. Rebekah assured him and took responsibility for any curse that might come. She dressed Jacob in Esau's clothes and covered his hands and neck with goat skins to mimic Esau's hairiness. Jacob brought the meal to Isaac, who, despite recognizing Jacob's voice, was convinced by the feel of his hands and the smell of his clothes that it was Esau. Isaac blessed Jacob, giving him the dew of heaven, the richness of the earth, and dominion over his brothers.

Just after Jacob left, Esau returned from hunting and prepared a meal for Isaac. When Esau presented it, Isaac realized he had been deceived and had already given the blessing to Jacob. Esau pleaded for a blessing, but Isaac could only offer a lesser one, foretelling that Esau would live by the sword and serve his brother but would eventually break free.Esau cried out, "Haven't you saved any blessing for me?" Isaac replied, "I have made Jacob your master and given him all his brothers as servants. I've sustained him with grain and wine. What can I do for you now, my son?" Esau pleaded, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too!" And Esau wept loudly.

Isaac answered, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness and the dew of heaven above. You will live by the sword and serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck."

Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He thought, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob." When Rebekah was told what Esau had said, she sent for Jacob and warned him, "Your brother Esau is planning to kill you. Flee to my brother Laban in Haran and stay with him until Esau's anger subsides. When he forgets what you did, I'll send for you. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"

Rebekah then said to Isaac, "I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of them, my life will not be worth living." So Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and instructed him, "Do not marry a Canaanite woman. Go to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother's father Bethuel. Marry one of the daughters of your uncle Laban. May God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful, and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples. May He give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham." Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.

Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan Aram to find a wife, and that Jacob had obeyed his parents. Realizing how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father, Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, in addition to the wives he already had.

Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. He stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. He dreamed of a ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it. The Lord stood above it and said, "I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, spreading out to the west, east, north, and south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised."

Jacob awoke and thought, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it." He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven." Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it. He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz. Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey, providing me with food and clothes so that I return safely to my father's household, then the Lord will be my God. This stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me, I will give you a tenth."

Jacob continued his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples. He saw a well in the field with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. A large stone covered the mouth of the well. When all the flocks were gathered, the stone would be rolled away, and the sheep watered. Jacob asked the shepherds, "Where are you from?" They replied, "We are from Haran." He asked, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's grandson?" They answered, "Yes, we know him." Jacob inquired, "Is he well?" They said, "Yes, and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."

Jacob told them, "The sun is still high; it's not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture." They replied, "We can't until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep." While he was still talking with them, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherd. When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the well's mouth and watered his uncle's sheep. Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud. He told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.

As soon as Laban heard about Jacob, his sister's son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him to his home. There Jacob told him all these things. Then Laban said to him, "You are my own flesh and blood." Jacob stayed with him for a whole month.

Laban said to Jacob, "Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be." Now Laban had two daughters; the older was Leah, and the younger was Rachel. Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, "I'll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel." Laban agreed, saying, "It's better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me." So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.

Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her." So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast. But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her. Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant. When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?" Laban replied, "It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one. Finish this daughter's bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work." And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant. Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.

When the Lord saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless. Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, "It is because the Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now." She conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, "Because the Lord heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too." So she named him Simeon. Again she conceived and gave birth to a son. She said, "Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons." So he was named Levi. She conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, "This time I will praise the Lord." So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.

When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I'll die!" Jacob became angry with her and said, "Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?" Then she said, "Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her." So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her, and she became pregnant and bore him a son.Rachel said, "God has judged me and heard my plea, giving me a son." She named him Dan. Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again and bore Jacob another son. Rachel said, "I have struggled greatly with my sister and won," naming him Naphtali.

When Leah saw she had stopped bearing children, she gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. Zilpah bore Jacob a son, and Leah named him Gad, saying, "A troop is coming." Zilpah bore another son, and Leah named him Asher, saying, "I am happy, for women will call me blessed."

During the wheat harvest, Reuben found mandrakes and brought them to Leah. Rachel asked Leah for some mandrakes. Leah replied, "Isn't it enough you took my husband? Now you want my son's mandrakes too?" Rachel said, "Jacob can sleep with you tonight in exchange for the mandrakes." That evening, Leah told Jacob, "You must sleep with me tonight; I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." Jacob slept with her, and God listened to Leah. She conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son, naming him Issachar, saying, "God has rewarded me for giving my maid to my husband."

Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son, naming him Zebulun, saying, "God has given me a good gift; now my husband will honor me because I have borne him six sons." Later, she bore a daughter named Dinah.

God remembered Rachel and listened to her, allowing her to conceive. She bore a son and said, "God has taken away my disgrace," naming him Joseph, saying, "May the Lord add another son to me."

After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob asked Laban to let him return to his homeland with his wives and children. Laban, realizing he had been blessed because of Jacob, asked him to name his wages. Jacob reminded Laban of his hard work and how Laban's wealth had increased because of him. Jacob proposed to continue tending Laban's flocks if he could keep the speckled and spotted animals as his wages. Laban agreed.

Jacob separated the speckled and spotted animals and used a breeding technique involving peeled branches to ensure the strongest animals were speckled and spotted. As a result, Jacob's flocks grew stronger and more numerous than Laban's.

Jacob's wealth increased significantly, causing Laban's sons to become envious. Jacob noticed Laban's attitude toward him had changed. God told Jacob to return to his homeland, promising to be with him. Jacob explained the situation to Rachel and Leah, who agreed to leave with him, as they felt their father had treated them unfairly.

Jacob gathered his family and possessions and left without telling Laban. Rachel stole her father's household gods. Laban pursued them, but God warned him in a dream not to harm Jacob. When Laban caught up with Jacob, he accused him of stealing his daughters and gods. Jacob, unaware Rachel had taken the gods, allowed Laban to search their tents. Rachel hid the gods and claimed she couldn't rise because of her period, so Laban didn't find them.

Jacob confronted Laban about his mistreatment and reminded him of his faithful service. They made a covenant, setting up a pillar as a witness, and agreed not to harm each other. Laban kissed his daughters and grandchildren goodbye and returned home.Jacob continued, "For twenty years I've been with you. Your sheep and goats never miscarried, and I didn't eat any rams from your flock. If an animal was killed by wild beasts, I bore the loss myself. You demanded compensation from me whether it was stolen by day or night. I endured scorching heat by day and freezing cold by night, often losing sleep. I worked for you for fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. If it weren't for the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God saw my hardship and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night."

Laban replied, "These daughters are my daughters, these children are my children, and these flocks are my flocks. Everything you see is mine. But what can I do today about my daughters or the children they have borne? Let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."

Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. He told his relatives to gather stones, and they made a heap and ate there by the heap. Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed. It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other. If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."

Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me. This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you, and you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me. May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the fear of his father Isaac. He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.

Early the next morning, Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.

Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim.

Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. He instructed them, "This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'"

When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him." In great fear and distress, Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well. He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape."

Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, LORD, you who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,' I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps. Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children. But you have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'"

He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds."

He instructed the one in the lead, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?' then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"

He also instructed the second, the third, and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me." So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.

That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak."

But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."

The man asked him, "What is your name?"

"Jacob," he answered.

Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome."

Jacob said, "Please tell me your name."

But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there.

So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared." The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.

Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants. He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.

But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked.

Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant."

Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down. Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.

Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?"

"To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said.

But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."

"No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.

Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you."

But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."

Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you."

"But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."

So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.

After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent. There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.

Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land. When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her. His heart was drawn to Dinah, daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.Shechem, deeply in love with Dinah, spoke to his father Hamor, asking him to arrange a marriage with her. When Jacob heard that Shechem had violated his daughter, he remained silent until his sons returned from the fields. Hamor approached Jacob to discuss the matter, and Jacob's sons, upon hearing what happened, were outraged.

Hamor proposed that their families intermarry and live together in peace. Shechem offered to pay any bride price for Dinah. Jacob's sons deceitfully agreed, on the condition that all the men in Shechem's city be circumcised. Hamor and Shechem agreed and convinced the men of their city to comply.

On the third day, while the men were still in pain from the circumcision, Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi attacked the city, killing all the males, including Hamor and Shechem. They rescued Dinah and plundered the city, taking livestock, wealth, women, and children.

Jacob rebuked Simeon and Levi, fearing retaliation from neighboring tribes. They defended their actions, arguing that their sister should not be treated like a prostitute.

God then instructed Jacob to move to Bethel and build an altar. Jacob told his household to discard their foreign gods and purify themselves. They journeyed to Bethel, where Jacob built an altar and named the place El Bethel. God appeared to Jacob again, reaffirming his new name, Israel, and promising that nations and kings would descend from him.

Rachel, Jacob's wife, went into labor and gave birth to Benjamin but died during childbirth. Jacob buried her and set up a pillar on her grave. Israel (Jacob) continued his journey, and his son Reuben committed a grave sin by sleeping with Bilhah, Jacob's concubine.

Jacob's twelve sons were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. Jacob reunited with his father Isaac in Hebron, where Isaac later died and was buried by his sons Esau and Jacob.

Esau's descendants settled in the hill country of Seir, becoming the Edomites. Esau's sons included Eliphaz, Reuel, Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. The descendants of Esau became leaders and established their own clans in Edom.The descendants of Seir in the land of Edom included Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. Lotan's children were Hori and Hemam, and his sister was Timna. Shobal's children were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. Zibeon's children were Ajah and Anah, the latter of whom discovered mules in the wilderness while tending his father's donkeys. Anah's children were Dishon and Aholibamah. Dishon's children were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. Ezer's children were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. Dishan's children were Uz and Aran. These were the leaders of the Horites: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan, who ruled in the land of Seir.

Before any king ruled over the Israelites, the kings of Edom were Bela son of Beor, who ruled in Dinhabah; Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah; Husham from the land of the Temanites; Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in Moab and ruled in Avith; Samlah from Masrekah; Saul from Rehoboth by the river; Baalhanan son of Achbor; and Hadar, who ruled in Pau, with his wife Mehetabel, daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Mezahab.

The leaders of Esau's descendants, according to their families and locations, were Timnah, Alvah, Jetheth, Aholibamah, Elah, Pinon, Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, Magdiel, and Iram. These were the leaders of Edom, the descendants of Esau, who lived in their respective territories.

Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, where his father had been a foreigner. Joseph, at seventeen, was tending the flock with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph reported their misdeeds to their father. Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more than his other children because he was born in his old age, and he made Joseph a special coat of many colors. This favoritism caused Joseph's brothers to hate him and speak harshly to him.

Joseph had a dream and shared it with his brothers, which made them hate him even more. In the dream, they were binding sheaves in the field, and Joseph's sheaf stood upright while their sheaves bowed down to it. His brothers asked if he intended to rule over them and hated him even more for his dreams and words. Joseph had another dream where the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed down to him. When he told this dream to his father and brothers, his father rebuked him, asking if they were all to bow down to him. His brothers envied him, but his father pondered the dream.

Joseph's brothers went to graze their father's flock in Shechem. Israel sent Joseph to check on them and report back. Joseph found them in Dothan after a man directed him there. When his brothers saw him approaching, they plotted to kill him, calling him "the dreamer." Reuben intervened, suggesting they throw Joseph into a pit instead of killing him, intending to rescue him later. They stripped Joseph of his coat and threw him into an empty pit.

As they ate, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, carrying spices, balm, and myrrh to Egypt. Judah suggested selling Joseph to the Ishmaelites instead of killing him, as he was their brother. The brothers agreed and sold Joseph for twenty pieces of silver. The Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt. Reuben returned to the pit and, finding Joseph gone, tore his clothes in distress. The brothers dipped Joseph's coat in goat's blood and sent it to their father, who recognized it and believed a wild animal had killed Joseph. Jacob mourned deeply, refusing to be comforted, saying he would mourn until he joined Joseph in the grave. Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.

At that time, Judah left his brothers and stayed with a man named Hirah in Adullam. Judah married a Canaanite woman named Shuah, and they had three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Judah arranged a marriage for Er with a woman named Tamar. However, Er was wicked in the Lord's sight, and the Lord put him to death. Judah then told Onan to marry Tamar and produce offspring for his brother. Onan, knowing the offspring would not be his, spilled his semen on the ground to avoid providing offspring for his brother. This displeased the Lord, so He put Onan to death as well. Judah told Tamar to live as a widow in her father's house until Shelah grew up, fearing he might die too. Tamar obeyed and lived in her father's house.

After some time, Judah's wife Shuah died. After mourning, Judah went to Timnath to shear his sheep, accompanied by his friend Hirah. Tamar, hearing this, disguised herself as a prostitute and sat by the road to Timnath, as she saw that Shelah had grown up but she had not been given to him as a wife. Judah saw her, thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face, and propositioned her. She asked for a pledge until he sent her a young goat. He gave her his signet, bracelets, and staff. They slept together, and she conceived. Tamar then returned home, removing her disguise and resuming her widow's garments. Judah later sent the goat through his friend Hirah to retrieve his pledge, but Hirah could not find her.Judah's friend, the Adullamite, went to retrieve the pledge from the woman but couldn't find her. He asked the locals about the prostitute who had been by the roadside, but they said there was no such woman. When he reported back to Judah, Judah decided to let her keep the items to avoid further embarrassment, acknowledging that he had sent the goat but she wasn't found.

About three months later, Judah was informed that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had acted as a prostitute and was pregnant. Judah ordered her to be brought out and burned. As she was being brought out, Tamar sent a message to Judah, revealing that she was pregnant by the man who owned the signet, bracelets, and staff she had. Judah recognized them and admitted that she was more righteous than he was because he had not given her to his son Shelah. He did not sleep with her again.

When Tamar gave birth, she had twins. During the delivery, one baby put out his hand, and the midwife tied a scarlet thread around it, declaring him the firstborn. However, he pulled his hand back, and his brother came out first. The midwife exclaimed at the unexpected turn of events and named him Perez. The baby with the scarlet thread was born afterward and was named Zerah.

Meanwhile, Joseph was taken to Egypt and sold to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard. The Lord was with Joseph, and he prospered in Potiphar's house. Potiphar saw that the Lord was with Joseph and made him the overseer of his household, entrusting him with everything he owned. Because of Joseph, the Lord blessed Potiphar's house and fields. Potiphar left everything in Joseph's care, only concerning himself with the food he ate. Joseph was handsome and well-built.

After some time, Potiphar's wife tried to seduce Joseph, but he refused, explaining that he couldn't betray his master or sin against God. Despite her daily attempts, Joseph did not give in. One day, when Joseph was alone in the house, she grabbed his garment and demanded he sleep with her. Joseph fled, leaving his garment in her hand. She then accused Joseph of trying to assault her, showing the garment as evidence. When Potiphar heard her story, he was furious and had Joseph imprisoned.

Even in prison, the Lord was with Joseph, showing him mercy and granting him favor with the prison warden. The warden put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners and everything that happened there. The warden trusted Joseph completely because the Lord made Joseph successful in all he did.

Sometime later, Pharaoh's chief butler and chief baker offended him and were imprisoned in the same place as Joseph. The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to attend to them. Both men had dreams on the same night, and Joseph noticed their distress the next morning. When they explained that they had no one to interpret their dreams, Joseph told them that interpretations belong to God and asked them to share their dreams.

The chief butler described his dream of a vine with three branches that budded, blossomed, and produced ripe grapes. He pressed the grapes into Pharaoh's cup and handed it to Pharaoh. Joseph interpreted the dream, saying the three branches represented three days, and within three days, Pharaoh would restore the butler to his position. Joseph asked the butler to remember him and mention him to Pharaoh to help get him out of prison, explaining that he had been wrongfully imprisoned.

Seeing the favorable interpretation, the chief baker shared his dream of three baskets of baked goods on his head, with birds eating from the top basket. Joseph interpreted that the three baskets also represented three days, but in three days, Pharaoh would execute the baker, and birds would eat his flesh.

On Pharaoh's birthday, he held a feast and restored the chief butler to his position but executed the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted. However, the chief butler forgot about Joseph.

Two years later, Pharaoh had a dream where he stood by the river, and seven healthy cows came out to graze. Then, seven thin, ugly cows came out and ate the healthy cows. Pharaoh woke up but fell asleep again and dreamed of seven healthy ears of corn on one stalk, followed by seven thin ears scorched by the east wind. The thin ears swallowed the healthy ones. Pharaoh woke up troubled and called for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt, but none could interpret his dreams.

The chief butler then remembered Joseph and told Pharaoh about him.Joseph was quickly brought out of the dungeon. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to see Pharaoh. Pharaoh told Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I've heard you can understand dreams and interpret them." Joseph replied, "I can't do it, but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires."

Pharaoh then described his dream to Joseph: "I was standing by the river, and seven healthy, well-fed cows came out and grazed in the meadow. Then, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came out of the river and stood beside the healthy cows. The thin cows ate the healthy ones, but even after eating them, they looked just as bad as before. Then I woke up. In my second dream, I saw seven full, good ears of corn growing on one stalk. After them, seven thin ears, scorched by the east wind, sprouted and swallowed the good ears. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me."

Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Both dreams mean the same thing. God is showing Pharaoh what He is about to do. The seven healthy cows and the seven good ears of corn represent seven years of abundance. The seven thin cows and the seven scorched ears of corn represent seven years of famine. There will be seven years of great abundance in Egypt, followed by seven years of severe famine that will consume the land. The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and He will do it soon.

"Therefore, Pharaoh should look for a wise and discerning man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners to take a fifth of the harvest during the seven years of abundance. They should collect all the food of these good years and store up the grain under Pharaoh's authority, to be kept in the cities for food. This food will be a reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine."

Pharaoh and all his officials approved of Joseph's plan. Pharaoh said to his officials, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?" Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you."

Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt." Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and people shouted before him, "Make way!" Thus, he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.

Pharaoh told Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word, no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt." Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. Joseph traveled throughout Egypt.

Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. During the seven years of abundance, the land produced plentifully. Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city, he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it. Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.

Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh, saying, "It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household." The second son he named Ephraim, saying, "It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering."

The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt, there was food. When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you."

When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt. And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph because the famine was severe everywhere.

When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you just keep looking at each other? I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die." Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him. So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also.

Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked.

"From the land of Canaan," they replied, "to buy food."

Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected."

"No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have come to buy food. We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies."

"No!" he said to them. "You have come to see where our land is unprotected."

But they replied, "Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more."

Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told you: You are spies! And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!" And he put them all in custody for three days.

On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God: If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households. But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die." This they proceeded to do.

They said to one another, "Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that's why this distress has come upon us."

Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood." They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.

He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes. Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man's silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them, they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.

At the place where they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack. "My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack." Their hearts sank, and they turned to each other trembling and said, "What is this that God has done to us?"

When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said, "The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land. But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies. We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.' Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, 'This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go. But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.'"Joseph's brothers returned home and told their father, Jacob, everything that had happened. They explained that the man in charge of Egypt, who was actually Joseph, had accused them of being spies and demanded they bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to prove their honesty. Jacob was distressed, feeling he had already lost Joseph and Simeon, and now feared losing Benjamin too. Reuben offered to take responsibility for Benjamin, even pledging his own sons' lives if he failed to bring Benjamin back safely. Jacob reluctantly agreed, sending gifts and double the money to Egypt, hoping for mercy.

When the brothers returned to Egypt with Benjamin, Joseph saw them and arranged for them to dine at his house. The brothers were afraid, thinking they were in trouble because of the money found in their sacks. They explained the situation to Joseph's steward, who reassured them and brought Simeon out to join them. Joseph, deeply moved upon seeing Benjamin, had to leave the room to weep. He then composed himself and joined them for the meal, seating them according to their ages and giving Benjamin a portion five times larger than the others.

The next morning, Joseph instructed his steward to fill their sacks with food and secretly place his silver cup in Benjamin's sack. After they left, Joseph sent his steward to confront them about the "stolen" cup. The brothers were shocked and offered to become Joseph's slaves if the cup was found with any of them. When the cup was discovered in Benjamin's sack, they tore their clothes in despair and returned to Joseph's house. Judah pleaded with Joseph, explaining their father's deep attachment to Benjamin and the devastating impact it would have on him if Benjamin did not return.Judah continued to plead with Joseph, explaining that he had promised their father to take full responsibility for Benjamin. He offered to stay as a slave in Benjamin's place, fearing the heartbreak it would cause their father if Benjamin did not return.

Joseph could no longer contain his emotions and ordered everyone else to leave the room. He revealed his identity to his brothers, weeping so loudly that even the Egyptians and Pharaoh's household heard him. Joseph asked if their father was still alive, but his brothers were too shocked to respond. He reassured them, explaining that it was God's plan for him to be in Egypt to save lives during the famine.

Joseph instructed his brothers to return quickly to their father and bring him and their families to Egypt, where they would be provided for during the remaining years of famine. He embraced Benjamin and wept, and then kissed and wept with all his brothers, who finally spoke with him.

News of Joseph's brothers' arrival reached Pharaoh, who was pleased and instructed Joseph to bring his family to Egypt. Pharaoh promised them the best land and provisions for their journey. Joseph gave his brothers wagons, supplies, and new clothes, with extra gifts for Benjamin and their father. He sent them off, reminding them not to quarrel on the way.

When the brothers returned to Canaan and told Jacob that Joseph was alive and ruling Egypt, he was initially in disbelief. But when he saw the wagons and heard Joseph's message, his spirit revived, and he decided to go see Joseph before he died.

Jacob, also known as Israel, set out for Egypt with his entire family and possessions. God spoke to him in a vision, reassuring him not to fear going to Egypt, as He would make Jacob's descendants a great nation there and bring them back again. Jacob's sons carried him, their children, and their wives in the wagons provided by Pharaoh.

They arrived in Egypt with all their livestock and belongings. Joseph went to meet his father in Goshen, and they embraced and wept. Jacob expressed his contentment at seeing Joseph alive. Joseph then informed Pharaoh about his family's arrival and their occupation as shepherds, which was detested by the Egyptians, ensuring they would live separately in Goshen.

Joseph presented some of his brothers to Pharaoh, who asked about their occupation. They explained they were shepherds seeking pasture due to the famine in Canaan. Pharaoh welcomed them and offered them the best land in Egypt, even suggesting they oversee his own livestock if they were capable.

Joseph brought Jacob to meet Pharaoh, who asked about his age. Jacob replied that he was 130 years old and that his life had been difficult compared to his ancestors.Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left his presence. Joseph settled his family in the best part of Egypt, as Pharaoh had commanded, and provided them with food. The famine was severe, and there was no bread in the land. Joseph collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan in exchange for grain and brought it to Pharaoh's house. When the money ran out, the Egyptians asked Joseph for bread, offering their livestock in exchange. Joseph agreed and provided them with food for their animals.

The following year, the people, having no money or livestock left, offered themselves and their land to Pharaoh in exchange for food. Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh, except for the priests' land, which was provided for by Pharaoh. Joseph then gave the people seed to plant, with the agreement that they would give one-fifth of their harvest to Pharaoh and keep the rest for themselves.

The people were grateful and agreed to be Pharaoh's servants. Joseph established this as a law in Egypt, which remained in place. Meanwhile, Jacob's family thrived in Goshen, growing in number and wealth. Jacob lived in Egypt for 17 years, reaching the age of 147.

As Jacob's death approached, he asked Joseph to promise to bury him in Canaan with his ancestors. Joseph agreed and swore to do so. Later, when Jacob fell ill, Joseph brought his sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to see him. Jacob blessed them, claiming them as his own, and recounted God's promise to make his descendants a great nation.

Jacob blessed Joseph's sons, placing his right hand on the younger Ephraim's head, despite Joseph's attempt to correct him. Jacob explained that Ephraim would become greater than Manasseh. He then blessed Joseph and his descendants, promising God's continued presence and eventual return to Canaan.

Before his death, Jacob called his sons together to tell them what would happen in the future. He addressed each son, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and prophesied their destinies.Jacob blessed his sons, giving each a unique blessing. He then instructed them to bury him in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, in Canaan, where Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah were buried. After giving these instructions, Jacob passed away. Joseph mourned deeply, had his father embalmed, and the Egyptians mourned for seventy days.

After the mourning period, Joseph asked Pharaoh for permission to bury his father in Canaan, as promised. Pharaoh agreed, and Joseph, along with a large entourage, went to Canaan to bury Jacob. They mourned for seven days at the threshing floor of Atad, which was observed by the Canaanites.

Jacob's sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, as he had instructed. After the burial, Joseph and his brothers returned to Egypt. Joseph's brothers, fearing retribution for their past wrongs, asked for forgiveness. Joseph reassured them, saying that although they intended harm, God used it for good to save many lives. He promised to take care of them and their families.

Joseph lived in Egypt for 110 years, seeing his descendants to the third generation. Before his death, he reminded his brothers of God's promise to bring them out of Egypt and asked them to carry his bones with them when they left. Joseph died, was embalmed, and placed in a coffin in Egypt.

The descendants of Jacob, now called the Israelites, grew in number and strength in Egypt. A new Pharaoh, who did not know Joseph, saw them as a threat and enslaved them, forcing them to build cities and work under harsh conditions. Despite the oppression, the Israelites continued to multiply.

Pharaoh ordered the Hebrew midwives to kill all newborn Hebrew boys, but they disobeyed, fearing God. When questioned, they explained that Hebrew women gave birth before they arrived. God blessed the midwives for their actions, and the Israelites continued to grow.

Pharaoh then commanded all his people to throw every newborn Hebrew boy into the Nile River. During this time, a Levite woman gave birth to a son and hid him for three months. When she could no longer hide him, she placed him in a basket and set it among the reeds by the riverbank. The baby's sister watched from a distance.

Pharaoh's daughter found the basket, felt compassion for the crying baby, and recognized him as a Hebrew child. The baby's sister offered to find a Hebrew woman to nurse him, and Pharaoh's daughter agreed. The baby's mother was brought to nurse him, and later, he was adopted by Pharaoh's daughter and named Moses, meaning "drawn out of the water."

When Moses grew up, he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew and killed the Egyptian, hiding the body in the sand. The next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting and tried to intervene, but they questioned his authority and mentioned the murder. Fearing for his life, Moses fled to Midian, where he sat by a well.Moses was sitting by a well when the priest of Midian's seven daughters came to draw water for their father's flock. Some shepherds tried to drive them away, but Moses stood up, helped them, and watered their flock. When the daughters returned home early, their father, Reuel, asked why. They explained that an Egyptian had helped them. Reuel asked them to invite Moses to eat with them. Moses agreed to stay with Reuel and married his daughter Zipporah. They had a son named Gershom, meaning "I have been a stranger in a foreign land."

Over time, the king of Egypt died, and the Israelites groaned under their slavery, crying out for help. God heard their cries and remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He looked upon the Israelites and was concerned for them.

Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, when he led the flock to Horeb, the mountain of God. There, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a burning bush that was not consumed by the fire. Moses approached to see this strange sight, and God called to him from the bush, instructing him to remove his sandals because he was standing on holy ground. God introduced Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.

God told Moses that He had seen the suffering of His people in Egypt and heard their cries. He planned to rescue them from the Egyptians and bring them to a land flowing with milk and honey, the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. God commanded Moses to go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses questioned his ability to do this, but God assured him that He would be with him and that the sign of their success would be their worship of God on that mountain.

Moses asked what he should say if the Israelites asked for God's name. God replied, "I AM WHO I AM," instructing Moses to tell them that "I AM" had sent him. God further instructed Moses to tell the Israelites that the Lord, the God of their ancestors, had appeared to him and promised to bring them out of Egypt to a prosperous land. God assured Moses that the elders of Israel would listen to him and that they should request a three-day journey into the wilderness to worship God. God warned that Pharaoh would not let them go easily, but He would perform wonders in Egypt, and eventually, Pharaoh would let them go. The Israelites would leave with favor from the Egyptians, taking valuable items with them.

Moses expressed doubt that the Israelites would believe him, so God gave him signs to perform: turning his staff into a serpent and back, making his hand leprous and then healing it, and turning river water into blood. Moses still hesitated, citing his lack of eloquence. God reassured him that He would help him speak and teach him what to say. When Moses continued to resist, God appointed his brother Aaron to speak for him, promising to guide both of them.

Moses returned to Jethro and asked to go back to Egypt to see if his people were still alive. Jethro gave his blessing. God instructed Moses to perform the wonders before Pharaoh but warned that He would harden Pharaoh's heart. God told Moses to tell Pharaoh that Israel was His firstborn son and to let them go, or He would kill Pharaoh's firstborn son.

On the way to Egypt, God sought to kill Moses, but Zipporah circumcised their son and touched Moses' feet with the foreskin, saving his life. God then instructed Aaron to meet Moses in the wilderness. They reunited, and Moses shared God's message and signs. Together, they gathered the elders of Israel, and Aaron conveyed God's words and performed the signs. The people believed and worshipped when they heard that God had seen their suffering.

Moses and Aaron then approached Pharaoh, relaying God's command to let the Israelites go to hold a feast in the wilderness.Pharaoh responded, "Who is the LORD that I should obey Him and let Israel go? I don't know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go." Moses and Aaron replied, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or He may strike us with plagues or the sword." 

Pharaoh retorted, "Why are you distracting the people from their work? Get back to your labor!" He then commanded the taskmasters and foremen, "Do not supply the people with straw for making bricks. Let them gather their own straw, but require them to make the same number of bricks as before. They are lazy; that's why they are asking to go and sacrifice to their God. Make the work harder for them so they keep working and pay no attention to lies."

The taskmasters and foremen told the people, "Pharaoh says, 'I will not give you straw. Go and find your own straw wherever you can, but your work quota will not be reduced.'" So the people scattered throughout Egypt to gather stubble to use as straw. The taskmasters kept pressing them, "Complete your daily quota of bricks, just as when you had straw." The Israelite foremen, appointed by Pharaoh's taskmasters, were beaten and asked, "Why haven't you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"

The Israelite foremen went to Pharaoh and pleaded, "Why are you treating your servants this way? No straw is given to us, yet we are told to make bricks. Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people." Pharaoh replied, "You are lazy! That's why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.' Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."

The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You must not reduce the number of bricks required each day." When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting for them. They said, "May the LORD judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."

Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why did you send me? Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."

Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. Because of my mighty hand, he will let them go; because of my mighty hand, he will drive them out of his country." God also said to Moses, "I am the LORD. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself fully known to them. I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners. Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.

"Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'"

Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor. Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country." But Moses said to the LORD, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?"

Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. These were the heads of their families: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben. The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon. These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years. The sons of Gershon by clans: Libni and Shimei. The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records. Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans. Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan.

It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions." They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron.

Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt, he said to him, "I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you." But Moses said to the LORD, "Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"

Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country. But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt, he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites. And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it."

Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them. Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.

The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miracle,' then say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,' and it will become a snake." So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake. Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts: Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs. Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.

Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. Then say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened. This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood. The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.'"

The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs'—and they will turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels of wood and stone." Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded.Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. Aaron raised his staff and struck the waters of the Nile in front of Pharaoh and his officials, turning the water into blood. The fish died, the river smelled terrible, and the Egyptians couldn't drink the water. Magicians of Egypt did the same with their spells, and Pharaoh's heart remained stubborn. He ignored Moses and Aaron and went back to his palace. The Egyptians had to dig around the river for drinking water. Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.

The LORD told Moses to go to Pharaoh and say, "Let my people go so they can worship me. If you refuse, I will plague your land with frogs. The Nile will teem with frogs that will come into your palace, your bedroom, your bed, the houses of your officials, and your people, even into your ovens and kneading bowls." The LORD instructed Moses to tell Aaron to stretch out his hand with his staff over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the land. The magicians did the same with their spells, bringing more frogs.

Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and pleaded, "Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD." Moses asked Pharaoh to set the time for the frogs to be removed, and Pharaoh said, "Tomorrow." Moses agreed, saying it would be done so Pharaoh would know there is no one like the LORD. The frogs died in the houses, courtyards, and fields, and the Egyptians piled them into heaps, making the land reek. But when Pharaoh saw relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.

The LORD then told Moses to tell Aaron to stretch out his staff and strike the dust of the ground, and it became gnats throughout Egypt. The magicians tried to produce gnats with their spells but couldn't. They told Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." Yet Pharaoh's heart was hard, and he wouldn't listen.

The LORD told Moses to rise early and confront Pharaoh as he went to the water, saying, "Let my people go so they can worship me. If you don't, I will send swarms of flies on you, your officials, your people, and your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and the ground will be covered with them. But I will spare the region of Goshen, where my people live; no flies will be there. This will show that I, the LORD, am in this land. I will make a distinction between my people and your people."

The LORD did as he said, and dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and the houses of his officials, ruining the land. Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land." Moses replied, "That wouldn't be right. The sacrifices we offer to the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their sight, won't they stone us? We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us."

Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me." Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. But Pharaoh must not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD." Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD, and the LORD did as Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh, his officials, and his people; not a single fly remained. But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and would not let the people go.

The LORD told Moses to go to Pharaoh and say, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'Let my people go so they may worship me. If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats. But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.'"

The LORD set a time and said, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land." The next day, the LORD did it: all the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding, and he would not let the people go.

The LORD told Moses and Aaron to take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh. It would become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, causing festering boils on people and animals. They did as the LORD commanded, and boils broke out on the Egyptians and their animals. The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils, and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so he wouldn't listen to Moses and Aaron.

The LORD told Moses to get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh, and say, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'Let my people go so they may worship me, or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you, your officials, and your people, so you may know there is no one like me in all the earth. For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go. Therefore, at this time tomorrow, I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now. Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.'"

Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and livestock inside. But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.

The LORD told Moses to stretch out his hand toward the sky so that hail would fall all over Egypt—on people, animals, and everything growing in the fields. When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. The LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt; hail fell, and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. Throughout Egypt, hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree. The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.

Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "This time I have sinned. The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong. Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't have to stay any longer."Moses replied, "As soon as I leave the city, I will pray to the LORD, and the thunder and hail will stop so that you may know the earth belongs to the LORD. But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God." The flax and barley were destroyed because they were in season, but the wheat and spelt were not destroyed because they ripen later.

Moses left Pharaoh, prayed to the LORD, and the thunder, hail, and rain stopped. When Pharaoh saw this, he sinned again and hardened his heart, as did his officials. Pharaoh's heart remained hard, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.

The LORD told Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs among them. This is so you can tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt with the Egyptians and performed my signs among them, so you may know that I am the LORD."

Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go so they may worship me. If you refuse, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. They will cover the ground so that it cannot be seen and will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree growing in your fields. They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land until now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.

Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go so they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?" Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But tell me who will be going."

Moses answered, "We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."

Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly, you are bent on evil. No! Have only the men go and worship the LORD, since that's what you have been asking for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.

The LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail." So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts; they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.

Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me." Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD. The LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left anywhere in Egypt. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.

Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt." So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.

Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."

But Moses said, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God. Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there, we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD."

But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go. Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face, you will die."

"Just as you say," Moses replied. "I will never appear before you again."

The LORD had said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely. Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold." (The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by the people.)

So Moses said, "This is what the LORD says: 'About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. But among the Israelites, not a dog will bark at any person or animal.' Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that, I will leave." Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.

The LORD had said to Moses, "Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt." Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.

The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, "This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household. If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, taking into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats. Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs, and internal organs. Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover.

"On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD. The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.

"This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD—a lasting ordinance. For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do.""On the first day of the festival, you can only do the work necessary to prepare food. You must celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread because it was on this day that I brought your people out of Egypt. This is a lasting tradition for all generations. From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day, you must eat bread without yeast. For seven days, no yeast should be found in your homes. Anyone who eats anything with yeast during this time will be cut off from the community of Israel, whether they are a foreigner or a native-born. Eat nothing with yeast; wherever you live, eat unleavened bread."

Moses then called all the elders of Israel and instructed them to select a lamb for their families and slaughter it for the Passover. He told them to take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood collected in a basin, and smear it on the top and sides of the doorframes of their houses. No one should leave their house until morning. The LORD will pass through Egypt to strike down the Egyptians, but when He sees the blood on the doorframes, He will pass over that house and not allow the destroyer to enter and strike you down. This is a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.

When you enter the land the LORD has promised to give you, you must continue to observe this ceremony. When your children ask, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?' tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when He struck down the Egyptians.' Then the people bowed down and worshipped. The Israelites did just as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.

At midnight, the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock. Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead. Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and said, 'Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested. Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.'

The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country, saying, 'Otherwise, we will all die!' So the people took their dough before the yeast was added and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing. The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.

The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. Many other people went up with them, along with large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.

The Israelites had lived in Egypt for 430 years. At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD's divisions left Egypt. Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.

The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 'These are the regulations for the Passover meal: No foreigner may eat it. Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him, but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it. It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones. The whole community of Israel must celebrate it. A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the LORD's Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it. The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.'

All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. And on that very day, the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.

The LORD said to Moses, 'Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.'

Then Moses said to the people, 'Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast. Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving. When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites—the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe this ceremony in this month: For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD. Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders. On that day tell your son, 'I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.' This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand. You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.

After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors, you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD. Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons. In days to come, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.' And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.'

When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, 'If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.' So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle. Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, 'God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.'

After leaving Succoth, they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.

Then the LORD said to Moses, 'Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.' And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.' So the Israelites did this.

When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, 'What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!' So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly."The Egyptians chased after the Israelites with all of Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and army, catching up to them by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon. When the Israelites saw the Egyptians approaching, they were terrified and cried out to the LORD. They complained to Moses, asking why he brought them out of Egypt to die in the wilderness, saying it would have been better to stay and serve the Egyptians.

Moses reassured them, telling them not to be afraid and to stand firm, as the LORD would deliver them. He said they would never see the Egyptians again. The LORD would fight for them, and they only needed to be still.

The LORD instructed Moses to tell the Israelites to move forward. He told Moses to lift his staff and stretch his hand over the sea to divide the waters so the Israelites could walk through on dry ground. The LORD said He would harden the hearts of the Egyptians so they would follow, and He would gain glory through Pharaoh and his army.

The angel of God, who had been leading the Israelites, moved behind them, and the pillar of cloud also moved to the rear, standing between the Egyptian and Israelite camps. Throughout the night, the cloud brought darkness to one side and light to the other, preventing the two groups from coming near each other.

Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind, turning it into dry land. The waters were divided, and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides. The Egyptians pursued them, but the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud, causing confusion among the Egyptians. He made the wheels of their chariots come off, making it difficult for them to drive. The Egyptians realized the LORD was fighting for the Israelites and tried to flee.

The LORD told Moses to stretch his hand over the sea again, and the waters returned, covering the chariots, horsemen, and the entire army of Pharaoh. Not one of them survived. The Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides. That day, the LORD saved Israel from the Egyptians, and the Israelites saw the Egyptians dead on the shore. They witnessed the LORD's great power and feared Him, putting their trust in the LORD and in Moses, His servant.

Moses and the Israelites sang a song to the LORD, praising Him for His triumph. They sang about the LORD being their strength and salvation, and how He had thrown Pharaoh's chariots and army into the sea. They praised the LORD's power and how He had defeated their enemies. They sang about the LORD's greatness and how He led His redeemed people to His holy dwelling. They declared that the LORD would reign forever.

Miriam, the prophetess and sister of Aaron, took a tambourine, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing. Miriam sang, "Sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea."

Moses led the Israelites from the Red Sea into the Desert of Shur. For three days, they traveled without finding water. When they reached Marah, they couldn't drink the water because it was bitter. The people grumbled against Moses, asking what they would drink. Moses cried out to the LORD, who showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. There, the LORD made a decree and a law for them and tested them. He said if they listened to Him and did what was right, He would not bring on them any of the diseases He brought on the Egyptians, for He is the LORD who heals them.

They then came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the water. The Israelites set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving Egypt. The whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron, wishing they had died in Egypt where they had plenty to eat, rather than being brought into the desert to starve.

The LORD told Moses He would rain down bread from heaven for the people. Each day, the people were to gather enough for that day, and on the sixth day, they were to gather twice as much. Moses and Aaron told the Israelites that in the evening, they would know it was the LORD who brought them out of Egypt, and in the morning, they would see the glory of the LORD because He had heard their grumbling. Moses said their grumbling was not against him and Aaron, but against the LORD.

Moses instructed Aaron to tell the whole community to come before the LORD, for He had heard their grumbling. As Aaron spoke, they looked toward the desert, and the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. The LORD told Moses He had heard the grumbling of the Israelites and would provide them with meat in the evening and bread in the morning so they would know He is the LORD their God.In the evening, quails came and covered the camp, and in the morning, there was dew around the camp. When the dew evaporated, it left behind a small, round substance, like frost on the ground. The Israelites saw it and asked each other what it was, as they didn't know. Moses told them it was the bread the LORD had given them to eat. He instructed them to gather as much as they needed, about an omer per person, for everyone in their tents. The Israelites did as instructed, some gathering more, some less. When they measured it, those who gathered much had no excess, and those who gathered little had no shortage; everyone had just enough.

Moses told them not to keep any of it until morning, but some didn't listen and kept it, and it bred worms and smelled bad. Moses was angry with them. They gathered it every morning, each person as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted. On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much, two omers per person, and the leaders reported this to Moses. He told them this was what the LORD had said: the next day was a holy Sabbath, so they should bake and boil what they needed and save the rest for the next morning. They did as Moses instructed, and it didn't smell or have worms. Moses told them to eat it that day because it was the Sabbath, and they wouldn't find any in the field. They were to gather it for six days, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there would be none. Some people went out to gather on the seventh day but found none. The LORD asked Moses how long they would refuse to keep His commands and instructions. He reminded them that the LORD had given them the Sabbath and provided enough bread for two days on the sixth day, so they should stay in their places on the seventh day. The people rested on the seventh day.

The Israelites called the bread "manna." It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. Moses said the LORD commanded them to keep an omer of it for future generations to see the bread He provided in the wilderness after bringing them out of Egypt. Moses told Aaron to take a jar, put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept for future generations. Aaron did as the LORD commanded Moses and placed it before the Testimony to be kept. The Israelites ate manna for forty years until they reached the border of Canaan. An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.

The whole Israelite community traveled from the Desert of Sin, moving from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water to drink. The people quarreled with Moses, demanding water. Moses asked why they were quarreling with him and testing the LORD. The people were thirsty and complained against Moses, accusing him of bringing them out of Egypt to die of thirst. Moses cried out to the LORD, asking what to do with the people, as they were almost ready to stone him. The LORD told Moses to go ahead of the people with some of the elders and take the staff he used to strike the Nile. The LORD said He would stand before Moses by the rock at Horeb, and Moses was to strike the rock, and water would come out for the people to drink. Moses did this in the sight of the elders, and he named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, asking if He was among them or not.

Then the Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. Moses told Joshua to choose some men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Moses said he would stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in his hand. Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but when he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one on each side, so his hands remained steady until sunset. Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. The LORD told Moses to write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and to make sure Joshua heard it because He would completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven. Moses built an altar and called it "The LORD is my Banner." He said, "Because hands were lifted up against the throne of the LORD, the LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation."

When Jethro, the priest of Midian and Moses' father-in-law, heard about everything God had done for Moses and His people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt, he took Moses' wife Zipporah, whom Moses had sent back, and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, "I have become a foreigner in a foreign land," and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my helper; He saved me from the sword of Pharaoh." Jethro, along with Moses' wife and sons, came to Moses in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God. Jethro sent word to Moses, saying he was coming with Moses' wife and her two sons. Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. They greeted each other and went into the tent. Moses told Jethro about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them. Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians. He said, "Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for He did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly." Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.

The next day, Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening. When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, "What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?" Moses answered, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will. Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and instructions." Moses' father-in-law replied, "What you are doing is not good. You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. Listen now to me, and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to Him. Teach them His decrees and instructions and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave. But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter because they will share it with you. If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied." Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.Moses allowed his father-in-law to leave, and he went back to his own land. In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt, they arrived in the Sinai wilderness. They set up camp in front of Mount Sinai. Moses went up the mountain to God, and the LORD called to him, saying, "Tell the Israelites: You saw what I did to the Egyptians and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now, if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, you will be my treasured possession among all people, for the whole earth is mine. You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."

Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak. The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.

The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said. The LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, 'Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death. They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.' Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain."

After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. Then he said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations."

On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently. As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and the voice of God answered him.

The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up, and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish. Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."

Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai because you yourself warned us, 'Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'"

The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them." So Moses went down to the people and told them.

And God spoke all these words:

"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

"You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.

"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

"Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.

"You shall not murder.

"You shall not commit adultery.

"You shall not steal.

"You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.

"You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."

When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance and said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die."

Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning."

The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was. The LORD said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites this: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven. Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.

"Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you. If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it. And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.'

"These are the laws you are to set before them:

"If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything. If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.

"But if the servant declares, 'I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,' then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.

"If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do. If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners because he has broken faith with her. If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing, and marital rights. If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.

"Anyone who strikes a person with a fatal blow is to be put to death. However, if it is not done intentionally, but God lets it happen, they are to flee to a place I will designate. But if anyone schemes and kills someone deliberately, that person is to be taken from my altar and put to death.

"Anyone who attacks their father or mother is to be put to death.

"Anyone who kidnaps someone is to be put to death, whether the victim has been sold or is still in the kidnapper's possession.

"Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.

"If people quarrel and one person hits another with a stone or with their fist and the victim does not die but is confined to bed, the one who struck the blow will not be held liable if the other can get up and walk around outside with a staff; however, the guilty party must pay the injured person for any loss of time and see that the victim is completely healed.

"Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.

"If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

"An owner who hits a male or female slave in the eye and destroys it must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye."If someone knocks out the tooth of a male or female servant, the servant must be set free to compensate for the loss. If an ox gores a man or woman to death, the ox must be stoned, and its meat must not be eaten, but the owner will not be held responsible. However, if the ox was known to be dangerous and the owner did not keep it confined, and it kills someone, both the ox and the owner must be put to death. If a ransom is imposed on the owner, they must pay whatever is demanded to redeem their life. This applies whether the ox gores a son or daughter. If the ox gores a servant, the owner must pay the servant's master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox must be stoned.

If someone opens or digs a pit and fails to cover it, and an ox or donkey falls into it, the person responsible must compensate the animal's owner, and the dead animal will belong to them. If one person's ox injures another's so that it dies, they must sell the live ox and divide the money and the dead animal equally. If it was known that the ox had a habit of goring and the owner did not keep it confined, the owner must pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will belong to them.

If someone steals an ox or sheep and slaughters or sells it, they must repay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep. If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that they die, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed. But if it happens after sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed. A thief must make full restitution; if they have nothing, they must be sold to pay for their theft. If the stolen animal is found alive in their possession—whether ox, donkey, or sheep—they must pay back double.

If someone lets their livestock graze in another person's field or vineyard, they must make restitution from the best of their own field or vineyard. If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes so that it burns stacks of grain or standing grain or the whole field, the one who started the fire must make restitution.

If someone gives their neighbor money or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbor's house, the thief, if caught, must pay back double. If the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether they have taken their neighbor's property. In all cases of illegal possession of an ox, donkey, sheep, garment, or any other lost property about which someone says, 'This is mine,' both parties are to bring their cases before the judges. The one whom the judges declare guilty must pay back double to the other.

If someone gives a neighbor a donkey, ox, sheep, or any other animal to care for and it dies or is injured or is taken away while no one is looking, the issue between them will be settled by the taking of an oath before the LORD that the neighbor did not lay hands on the other person's property. The owner is to accept this, and no restitution is required. But if the animal was stolen from the neighbor, restitution must be made to the owner. If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal, the neighbor shall bring in the remains as evidence and shall not be required to pay for the torn animal.

If someone borrows an animal from their neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, they must make restitution. But if the owner is with the animal, the borrower will not have to pay. If the animal was hired, the money paid for the hire covers the loss.

If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she will become his wife. If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins.

Do not allow a sorceress to live. Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal is to be put to death. Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the LORD must be destroyed.

Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt. Do not take advantage of the widow or the fatherless. If you do and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry. My anger will be aroused, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.

If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal; charge no interest. If you take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset, because that cloak is the only covering your neighbor has. What else can they sleep in? When they cry out to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.

Do not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people. Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats. You must give me the firstborn of your sons. Do the same with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but give them to me on the eighth day.

You are to be my holy people. So do not eat the meat of an animal torn by wild beasts; throw it to the dogs.

Do not spread false reports. Do not help a guilty person by being a malicious witness. Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd, and do not show favoritism to a poor person in a lawsuit.

If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to return it. If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; be sure to help them with it.

Do not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits. Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent or honest person to death, for I will not acquit the guilty.

Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the innocent.

Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners because you were foreigners in Egypt.

For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops, but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals may eat what is left. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.

Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed.

Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.

Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me. Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread; for seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt. No one is to appear before me empty-handed.

Celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the firstfruits of the crops you sow in your field. Celebrate the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in your crops from the field. Three times a year all the men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD.

Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast. The fat of my festival offerings must not be kept until morning.

Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God.

Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.

See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him. If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you. My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out. Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces. Worship the LORD your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you, and none will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full life span.

I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run. I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites out of your way. But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you. Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.

I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you. Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods. Do not let them live in your land, or they will cause you to sin against me, because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you.""Do not worship their gods, as it will lead you astray. The Lord then instructed Moses to come up the mountain with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel to worship from a distance. Only Moses was to approach the Lord; the others were not to come near, and the people were not to go up with him.

Moses relayed all the Lord's words and laws to the people, who responded in unison, 'We will do everything the Lord has said.' Moses wrote down everything the Lord had said. Early the next morning, he built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel. He sent young Israelite men to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice young bulls as fellowship offerings to the Lord. Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he splashed against the altar. He then read the Book of the Covenant to the people, who responded, 'We will do everything the Lord has said; we will obey.' Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, 'This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.'

Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky. But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank.

The Lord said to Moses, 'Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.' Then Moses set out with Joshua his aide, and Moses went up on the mountain of God. He said to the elders, 'Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute can go to them.' When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the Lord called to Moses from within the cloud. To the Israelites, the glory of the Lord looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain. Then Moses entered the cloud as he went up on the mountain, and he stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

The Lord said to Moses, 'Tell the Israelites to bring me an offering. You are to receive the offering for me from everyone whose heart prompts them to give. These are the offerings you are to receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze; blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair; ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather; acacia wood; olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them. Make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.

They are to make an ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it. Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other. Then make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it. The poles are to remain in the rings of this ark; they are not to be removed. Then put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law, which I will give you.

Make an atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. And make two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover. Make one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; make the cherubim of one piece with the cover, at the two ends. The cherubim are to have their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the cover. Place the cover on top of the ark and put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law that I will give you. There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the covenant law, I will meet with you and give you all my commands for the Israelites.

Make a table of acacia wood—two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. Overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it. Also make around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim. Make four gold rings for the table and fasten them to the four corners, where the four legs are. The rings are to be close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table. Make the poles of acacia wood, overlay them with gold, and carry the table with them. And make its plates and dishes of pure gold, as well as its pitchers and bowls for the pouring out of offerings. Put the bread of the Presence on this table to be before me at all times.

Make a lampstand of pure gold. Hammer out its base and shaft, and make its flower-like cups, buds, and blossoms of one piece with them. Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other. Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand. And on the lampstand, there are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms. One bud shall be under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all. The buds and branches shall all be of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold. Then make its seven lamps and set them up on it so that they light the space in front of it. Its wick trimmers and trays are to be of pure gold. A talent of pure gold is to be used for the lampstand and all these accessories. See that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.

Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by a skilled worker. All the curtains are to be the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide. Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five. Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same with the end curtain in the other set. Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other. Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a unit.

Make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether. All eleven curtains are to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. Join five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent. Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set. Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to fasten the tent together as a unit. As for the additional length of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over is to hang down at the rear of the tabernacle. The tent curtains will be a cubit longer on both sides; what is left will hang over the sides of the tabernacle so as to cover it. Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather.

Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle. Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide."Each board should be ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. Each board will have two tenons to fit together. Make twenty boards for the south side of the tabernacle, with forty silver bases—two bases under each board. For the north side, make twenty boards and forty silver bases. For the west side, make six boards, plus two boards for the corners. These corner boards will be joined at both the top and bottom with a single ring. There will be eight boards in total for the west side, with sixteen silver bases—two bases under each board.

Make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle, five for the boards on the other side, and five for the boards on the west side. The central crossbar will run from end to end at the middle of the boards. Overlay the boards with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Overlay the crossbars with gold as well. Set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.

Make a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker. Hang it on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold, standing on four silver bases. Hang the curtain under the clasps and place the Ark of the Covenant behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. Place the atonement cover on the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place. Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and the lampstand opposite it on the south side.

Make a curtain for the entrance to the tent, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer. Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain and overlay them with gold. Their hooks shall be of gold, and you shall cast five bronze bases for them.

Make an altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar is to be square, and three cubits high. Make a horn at each of the four corners, all of one piece with the altar, and overlay the altar with bronze. Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots to remove the ashes, and its shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks, and firepans. Make a bronze grating, a network, and a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the network. Put it under the ledge of the altar so that it is halfway up the altar. Make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze. The poles are to be inserted into the rings so they will be on two sides of the altar when it is carried. Make the altar hollow, out of boards. It is to be made just as you were shown on the mountain.

Make a courtyard for the tabernacle. The south side shall be a hundred cubits long and is to have curtains of finely twisted linen, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. The north side shall also be a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. The west end of the courtyard shall be fifty cubits wide and have curtains, with ten posts and ten bases. On the east end, the courtyard shall be fifty cubits wide. The curtains on one side of the entrance shall be fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases, and the curtains on the other side shall also be fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases.

For the entrance to the courtyard, provide a curtain twenty cubits long, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer—with four posts and four bases. All the posts around the courtyard are to have silver bands and hooks, and bronze bases. The courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with curtains of finely twisted linen five cubits high, and with bronze bases. All the other articles used in the service of the tabernacle, including all the tent pegs for it and those for the courtyard, are to be of bronze.

Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually. In the tent of meeting, outside the curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant, Aaron and his sons are to keep the lamps burning before the Lord from evening till morning. This is to be a lasting ordinance among the Israelites for the generations to come.

Have Aaron your brother brought to you from among the Israelites, along with his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, so they may serve me as priests. Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron to give him dignity and honor. Tell all the skilled workers to whom I have given wisdom in such matters that they are to make garments for Aaron, for his consecration, so he may serve me as priest. These are the garments they are to make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to make these sacred garments for your brother Aaron and his sons so they may serve me as priests. Have them use gold, and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.

Make the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen—the work of skilled hands. It is to have two shoulder pieces attached to two of its corners, so it can be fastened. Its skillfully woven waistband is to be like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen. Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel in the order of their birth—six names on one stone and the remaining six on the other. Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree settings and fasten them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear the names on his shoulders as a memorial before the Lord. Make gold filigree settings and two braided chains of pure gold, like a rope, and attach the chains to the settings.

Fashion a breastpiece for making decisions—the work of skilled hands. Make it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. It is to be square—a span long and a span wide—and folded double. Then mount four rows of precious stones on it. The first row shall be carnelian, chrysolite, and beryl; the second row shall be turquoise, lapis lazuli, and emerald; the third row shall be jacinth, agate, and amethyst; the fourth row shall be topaz, onyx, and jasper. Mount them in gold filigree settings. There are to be twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.Attach the breastplate to the ephod using blue cords, ensuring it stays securely in place. Aaron will carry the names of the Israelites on the breastplate over his heart when he enters the holy place, serving as a continual reminder before the Lord. Place the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate for making decisions, and they will also be over Aaron's heart when he goes before the Lord.

Make the robe of the ephod entirely blue, with an opening at the top reinforced to prevent tearing. Decorate the hem with alternating pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and gold bells. Aaron will wear this robe when he ministers, and the sound of the bells will be heard when he enters and exits the holy place, ensuring he does not die.

Craft a plate of pure gold and engrave it with "HOLINESS TO THE LORD." Attach it to the front of Aaron's turban with a blue cord. This plate will be on Aaron's forehead, symbolizing that he bears the responsibility for the sacred offerings of the Israelites, ensuring their acceptance before the Lord.

Embroider a tunic of fine linen, make a turban of fine linen, and a sash with needlework. For Aaron's sons, make tunics, sashes, and headbands for dignity and honor. Dress Aaron and his sons in these garments, anoint and consecrate them, so they may serve as priests. Provide them with linen undergarments to cover their bodies from waist to thigh, to be worn whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar, to avoid guilt and death. This is a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.

To consecrate them as priests, take a young bull and two unblemished rams, along with unleavened bread, cakes mixed with oil, and wafers anointed with oil, all made from wheat flour. Place them in a basket and present them with the bull and the two rams. Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water. Dress Aaron in the tunic, robe of the ephod, ephod, and breastplate, and fasten the ephod's waistband around him. Place the turban on his head and attach the holy crown to the turban. Anoint him by pouring oil on his head.

Bring his sons forward, dress them in tunics, and fasten sashes and headbands on them. The priesthood will be theirs by a lasting ordinance. Consecrate Aaron and his sons by bringing a bull to the tent of meeting. Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head, and you will slaughter it before the Lord. Apply some of its blood to the altar's horns and pour the rest at the base. Burn the bull's fat, liver, kidneys, and the fat covering them on the altar, but burn the flesh, hide, and offal outside the camp as a sin offering.

Take one ram, and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head. Slaughter it, sprinkle its blood on the altar, and cut it into pieces, washing the internal organs and legs. Burn the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering to the Lord, a pleasing aroma.

Take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head. Slaughter it, apply its blood to Aaron's right ear lobe, right thumb, and right big toe, and do the same for his sons. Sprinkle the altar with its blood. Mix some altar blood with anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron, his garments, and his sons and their garments, consecrating them.

Take the ram's fat, fat tail, internal fat, liver, kidneys, and right thigh, along with a loaf, cake, and wafer from the basket of unleavened bread before the Lord. Place these in Aaron's and his sons' hands and wave them before the Lord as a wave offering. Then burn them on the altar as a burnt offering to the Lord, a pleasing aroma.

Take the breast of Aaron's ordination ram and wave it before the Lord as a wave offering; it will be your share. Consecrate the wave offering breast and the heave offering thigh from the ordination ram, as they are for Aaron and his sons. This will be a lasting ordinance for the Israelites, as it is a contribution from their peace offerings to the Lord.

Aaron's sacred garments will be passed down to his descendants, who will wear them for seven days when they are anointed and ordained. Cook the ordination ram's meat in a holy place, and Aaron and his sons will eat it along with the bread from the basket at the tent of meeting entrance. They will eat these offerings, which were used to make atonement and consecrate them, but no outsider may eat them as they are holy. If any meat or bread is left until morning, burn it; it must not be eaten as it is holy.

Follow these instructions for Aaron and his sons' ordination, taking seven days to consecrate them. Each day, offer a bull as a sin offering to make atonement, purify the altar, and anoint it to consecrate it. For seven days, make atonement for the altar and consecrate it, making it most holy. Whatever touches the altar will be holy.

Offer two one-year-old lambs daily on the altar, one in the morning and one at twilight. With the morning lamb, offer a tenth of an ephah of flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer the second lamb at twilight with the same grain and drink offerings as in the morning, as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. This will be a regular burnt offering for generations to come at the tent of meeting entrance before the Lord, where He will meet and speak with you. The tent of meeting will be consecrated by His glory, and He will consecrate the tent, the altar, and Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. He will dwell among the Israelites and be their God, and they will know that He is the Lord their God who brought them out of Egypt to dwell among them.Make an altar of acacia wood. It should be square, one cubit long and one cubit wide, and two cubits high, with horns on its corners. Cover it with pure gold on the top, sides, and horns, and make a gold molding around it. Create two gold rings beneath the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles for carrying it. Make the poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold. Place the altar in front of the curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant, where I will meet with you.

Aaron must burn fragrant incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps, and again at twilight when he lights the lamps. This incense offering must continue for generations. Do not offer any unauthorized incense, burnt offering, grain offering, or drink offering on this altar. Once a year, Aaron must make atonement on its horns with the blood of the sin offering, making atonement for it throughout generations. It is most holy to the Lord.

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "When you take a census of the Israelites, each person must pay a ransom for their life to the Lord to avoid a plague. Each person counted must give half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs. Everyone twenty years old or older must give this offering to the Lord. The rich should not give more, and the poor should not give less than half a shekel. Use this atonement money for the service of the Tent of Meeting, as a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord, to make atonement for their lives."

The Lord also instructed Moses to make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and fill it with water. Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet with water from it whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister, to avoid death. This is a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.

The Lord spoke to Moses again, saying, "Take the finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, 250 shekels of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane, 500 shekels of cassia, all according to the sanctuary shekel, and a hin of olive oil. Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a blend of fragrant spices, the work of a perfumer. Use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Covenant, the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand. Consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy. Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve as priests. Tell the Israelites, 'This will be my sacred anointing oil for generations to come. Do not pour it on anyone else's body and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred. Anyone who makes perfume like it or puts it on someone who is not a priest must be cut off from their people.'"

The Lord said to Moses, "Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha, galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts, and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred. Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the Ark of the Covenant in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the Lord. Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people."

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all kinds of skills—to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver, and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts. Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also, I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you: the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand—and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests, and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you."

The Lord said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for generations to come, so you may know that I am the Lord, who makes you holy. Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death; those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people. For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death. The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for generations to come as a lasting covenant. It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'"

When the Lord finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.

When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."

Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons, and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me." So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron. He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."

When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the Lord." So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward, they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.

Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.' I have seen these people," the Lord said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people. Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."

But Moses sought the favor of the Lord his God. "Lord," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'""Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you promised, 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all this land I have spoken of, and they will inherit it forever.'" So the Lord changed His mind about the disaster He had planned to bring on His people.

Moses then turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. The tablets were inscribed on both sides, front and back. They were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.

When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp." But Moses replied, "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."

As soon as Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. He took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.

Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?" Aaron answered, "Do not be angry, my lord. You know how prone these people are to evil. They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.' So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"

Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the Lord, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.

Then he said to them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'" The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."

The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin." So Moses went back to the Lord and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."

The Lord replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book. Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin." And the Lord struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.

Then the Lord said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way."

When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments. For the Lord had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.'" So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.

Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the "tent of meeting." Anyone inquiring of the Lord would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp. And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent. As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the Lord spoke with Moses. Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent. The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.

Moses said to the Lord, "You have been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name and you have found favor with me.' If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people."

The Lord replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."

Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?"

And the Lord said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name."

Then Moses said, "Now show me your glory."

And the Lord said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live."

Then the Lord said, "There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."

The Lord said to Moses, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain. No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain."

So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the Lord had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the Lord. And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion, and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation."

Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped. "Lord," he said, "if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."

Then the Lord said: "I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the Lord, will do for you. Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you. Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles. Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices. And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.

"Do not make any idols.

"Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt."Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread as I commanded you, in the month of Abib, because that is when you came out of Egypt. Every firstborn male animal belongs to me, whether it's an ox or a sheep. You must redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you don't, you must break its neck. You must also redeem all your firstborn sons. No one should appear before me empty-handed.

Work for six days, but rest on the seventh day, even during plowing and harvest. Observe the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year. Three times a year, all your men must appear before the Lord, the God of Israel. I will drive out nations before you and expand your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times a year.

Do not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything containing yeast, and do not let the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning. Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.

The Lord said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel." Moses was there with the Lord for forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water, and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.

When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was unaware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them, so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them. Afterward, all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.

When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face. But whenever he entered the Lord's presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the Lord.

Moses gathered the whole Israelite community and said to them, "These are the things the Lord has commanded you to do: For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death. Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day."

Moses said to the whole Israelite community, "This is what the Lord has commanded: From what you have, take an offering for the Lord. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the Lord an offering of gold, silver, and bronze; blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair; ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather; acacia wood; olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.

All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the Lord has commanded: the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases; the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it; the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence; the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps, and oil for the light; the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle; the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes; the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests."

Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses' presence, and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the Lord for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments. All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings, and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the Lord. Everyone who had blue, purple, or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red, or other durable leather brought them. Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the Lord, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it. Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun—blue, purple, or scarlet yarn or fine linen. And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair. The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the Lord freewill offerings for all the work the Lord through Moses had commanded them to do.

Then Moses said to the Israelites, "See, the Lord has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver, and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts. And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others. He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers.

So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person to whom the Lord has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the Lord has commanded." Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the Lord had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work. They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning. So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing and said to Moses, "The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the Lord commanded to be done."

Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: "No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." And so the people were restrained from bringing more, because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.

All the skilled workers among them made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands. All the curtains were the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide. They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five. Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set. They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other. Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.

They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether. All eleven curtains were the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set. Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set. They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.Bezalel made a covering for the tent from ram skins dyed red, with an additional covering of badger skins on top. He constructed the tabernacle's framework from acacia wood, with each board standing upright. Each board was ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide, with two tenons for fitting them together. He made twenty boards for the south side, with forty silver bases—two bases for each board. The same was done for the north side. For the west side, he made six boards and two additional boards for the corners, all joined together with gold rings and overlaid with gold. He also made five crossbars of acacia wood for each side of the tabernacle, overlaid with gold, with gold rings to hold them.

Bezalel crafted a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, with cherubim skillfully woven into it. He made four pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold, with gold hooks and silver bases. For the entrance to the tent, he made a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, with five pillars overlaid with gold and bronze bases.

Bezalel also made the Ark of the Covenant from acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold inside and out, with a gold molding around it. It had four gold rings for carrying poles, also made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold. The atonement cover was made of pure gold, with two cherubim hammered out of gold at each end, facing each other with wings spread upward.

He made the table of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold, with a gold molding around it. It had four gold rings for the carrying poles, also made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold. He made all the utensils for the table from pure gold.

The lampstand was made of pure gold, with a central shaft and six branches, three on each side. Each branch had three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms. The lampstand and its accessories, including the wick trimmers and trays, were made from a talent of pure gold.

Bezalel made the altar of incense from acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold, with a gold molding around it. It had two gold rings for carrying poles, also made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold. He made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense.

He made the altar of burnt offering from acacia wood, overlaid with bronze, with a bronze grating and four bronze rings for carrying poles. The poles were made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze. The basin for washing was made of bronze, from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

Bezalel made the courtyard with fine linen curtains, with twenty bronze bases and silver hooks and bands for the south and north sides. The west side had fifty cubits of curtains with ten bronze bases and silver hooks and bands. The east side had fifty cubits of curtains, with fifteen cubits on each side of the entrance, each with three bronze bases and silver hooks and bands. The entrance curtain was made of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, with four bronze bases and silver hooks and bands.

All the pegs for the tabernacle and the surrounding courtyard were made of bronze. The total amount of gold used for the work was 29 talents and 730 shekels, and the silver from the community was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, each person contributing a half shekel.The total number of men aged twenty and above was 603,550. From the hundred talents of silver, they made the bases for the sanctuary and the veil, with each base weighing a talent. The remaining 1,775 shekels of silver were used to make hooks for the pillars, overlay their tops, and make bands. The bronze from the offerings amounted to 70 talents and 2,400 shekels, which were used to make the bases for the entrance to the tent, the bronze altar and its grating, and all the utensils for the altar. They also made the bases for the surrounding courtyard and the gate, as well as all the pegs for the tabernacle and the courtyard.

From blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, they made garments for service in the holy place and the sacred garments for Aaron, as the LORD commanded Moses. The ephod was made of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen. They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut it into strands to work into the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen. They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached at its two corners. The waistband was made in the same way, with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, as the LORD commanded Moses. They mounted onyx stones in gold settings, engraved with the names of the sons of Israel, and fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as a memorial.

The breastpiece was made with the same materials and craftsmanship as the ephod. It was square and doubled, a span long and a span wide. They mounted four rows of precious stones on it: the first row was a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl; the second row was a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald; the third row was a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; the fourth row was a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. Each stone was set in gold filigree and engraved with the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. They made braided chains of pure gold for the breastpiece and attached them to gold rings at the corners of the breastpiece. The other ends of the chains were fastened to the shoulder pieces of the ephod.

They made additional gold rings and attached them to the lower corners of the breastpiece and the ephod, tying the breastpiece to the ephod with a blue cord so it would not come loose. The robe of the ephod was made entirely of blue cloth, with an opening in the center like a collar, reinforced to prevent tearing. They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe, with gold bells between them. The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem, as the LORD commanded Moses.

They made tunics of fine linen for Aaron and his sons, a turban of fine linen, linen headbands, and undergarments of finely twisted linen. The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, embroidered with needlework, as the LORD commanded Moses. They made the plate of the sacred diadem out of pure gold and engraved on it "HOLY TO THE LORD." They fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the LORD commanded Moses.

All the work for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed as the LORD commanded Moses. The Israelites brought everything to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases; the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of another durable leather, and the shielding curtain; the ark of the covenant law with its poles and the atonement cover; the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence; the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the olive oil for the light; the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; and all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting; the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests.

The Israelites did all the work just as the LORD commanded Moses. Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD had commanded. So Moses blessed them.

The LORD then instructed Moses to set up the tabernacle on the first day of the first month. He was to place the ark of the covenant law in it and shield the ark with the curtain. He was to bring in the table and set out what belongs on it, bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps. The gold altar of incense was to be placed in front of the ark of the covenant law, and the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle was to be hung. The altar of burnt offering was to be placed in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting. The basin was to be placed between the tent of meeting and the altar and filled with water. The courtyard was to be set up around it, and the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard was to be hung.

Moses was to take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it, consecrating it and all its furnishings. The altar of burnt offering and all its utensils were to be anointed and consecrated, making the altar most holy. The basin and its stand were to be anointed and consecrated. Moses was to bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting, wash them with water, dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint and consecrate him so he could serve as priest. Aaron's sons were to be dressed in tunics, anointed, and consecrated to serve as priests. This anointing would be a lasting priesthood for generations to come.

Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded. On the first day of the first month of the second year, the tabernacle was set up. Moses set up the tabernacle, laid its bases, set up its frames, inserted its crossbars, and set up its posts. He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded. He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark, and put the atonement cover over it. He brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain to shield the ark of the covenant law, as the LORD commanded. He placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded. He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded. He placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded. He hung the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. He set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded.Moses placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, filling it with water for washing. Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet there whenever they entered the tent or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded. Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar, and hung the curtain at the entrance. With this, Moses completed the work.

A cloud then covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. Moses couldn't enter the tent because the cloud and the LORD's glory filled it. Whenever the cloud lifted from the tabernacle, the Israelites would continue their journey. If the cloud didn't lift, they stayed put until it did. The cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, visible to all the Israelites throughout their travels.

The LORD called to Moses from the tent of meeting and said, "Tell the Israelites: When anyone brings an offering to the LORD, it should be from the herd or flock. If it's a burnt offering from the herd, it must be a male without defect, offered voluntarily at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The person must lay their hand on the animal's head, and it will be accepted to make atonement for them. They must slaughter the bull before the LORD, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will bring the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The burnt offering must be skinned and cut into pieces. Aaron's sons will put fire on the altar and arrange wood on it. They will arrange the pieces, including the head and fat, on the wood burning on the altar. The internal organs and legs must be washed with water, and the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.

If the offering is from the flock, either sheep or goats, it must be a male without defect. It should be slaughtered on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron's sons will splash its blood against the sides of the altar. The offering must be cut into pieces, and the priest will arrange them, including the head and fat, on the wood burning on the altar. The internal organs and legs must be washed with water, and the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.

If the offering is a bird, it should be a turtledove or young pigeon. The priest will bring it to the altar, wring off its head, and burn it on the altar. Its blood will be drained on the side of the altar. The crop and feathers will be removed and thrown on the east side of the altar, where the ashes are. The bird will be torn open by its wings without being divided, and the priest will burn it on the wood burning on the altar as a burnt offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.

When someone brings a grain offering to the LORD, it should be fine flour with oil and frankincense. They will bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests, who will take a handful of the flour and oil with all the frankincense and burn it on the altar as a memorial portion, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.

If the grain offering is baked in an oven, it should be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. If it is prepared on a griddle, it should be fine flour mixed with oil, broken into pieces, and oil poured on it. If it is cooked in a pan, it should be made of fine flour with oil. The grain offering should be brought to the LORD and presented to the priest, who will take it to the altar. The priest will take a memorial portion and burn it on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.

No grain offering brought to the LORD should be made with yeast, for no yeast or honey should be burned as an offering to the LORD. Offerings of firstfruits can be brought to the LORD, but they should not be burned on the altar as a pleasing aroma. Every grain offering should be seasoned with salt, symbolizing the covenant with God. Do not leave the salt of the covenant out of your grain offerings; add salt to all your offerings.

If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, offer crushed heads of new grain roasted in the fire. Put oil and frankincense on it, and the priest will burn the memorial portion on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.

If someone offers a fellowship offering to the LORD, whether from the herd or flock, it must be without defect. They must lay their hand on the animal's head and slaughter it at the entrance of the tent of meeting. Aaron's sons will splash its blood against the sides of the altar. The person must present the fat covering the internal organs, the kidneys, and the long lobe of the liver. Aaron's sons will burn these on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to the LORD. If the offering is a goat, the same procedure applies. The fat belongs to the LORD and should not be eaten. This is a lasting ordinance for generations to come, wherever you live: do not eat any fat or blood.

The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "Tell the Israelites: If anyone sins unintentionally against any of the LORD's commands, they must bring a young bull without defect as a sin offering. They must bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, lay their hand on its head, and slaughter it before the LORD. The anointed priest will take some of the bull's blood into the tent of meeting, dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the curtain of the sanctuary."The priest will put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tent of meeting. He will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tent of meeting. He will remove all the fat from the bull, including the fat covering the internal organs, the kidneys, and the long lobe of the liver, and burn it on the altar. The rest of the bull, including its skin, flesh, head, legs, internal organs, and dung, will be taken outside the camp to a clean place where the ashes are dumped and burned on a wood fire.

If the entire community of Israel sins unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, but they realize their guilt later, they must offer a young bull as a sin offering. The elders of the community will lay their hands on the bull's head before the LORD, and it will be slaughtered. The anointed priest will take some of the bull's blood into the tent of meeting, dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the curtain. He will put some of the blood on the horns of the altar and pour out the rest at the base of the altar of burnt offering. He will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar, just as he did with the previous bull. The priest will then take the rest of the bull outside the camp and burn it as a sin offering for the community.

When a leader sins unintentionally against any of the LORD's commands and realizes his guilt, he must bring a male goat without defect as a sin offering. He will lay his hand on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering. The priest will take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, pouring out the rest at the base of the altar. He will burn all the fat on the altar, just as with the peace offerings. The priest will make atonement for the leader's sin, and he will be forgiven.

If any member of the community sins unintentionally and realizes their guilt, they must bring a female goat without defect as a sin offering. They will lay their hand on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering. The priest will take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, pouring out the rest at the base of the altar. He will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar, just as with the peace offerings. The priest will make atonement for the person's sin, and they will be forgiven.

If someone brings a lamb as a sin offering, it must be a female without defect. They will lay their hand on the lamb's head and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering. The priest will take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, pouring out the rest at the base of the altar. He will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar, just as with the peace offerings. The priest will make atonement for the person's sin, and they will be forgiven.

If someone hears a public charge to testify and they do not speak up, they will bear the consequences of their sin. If someone touches anything unclean, whether it is the carcass of an unclean animal or human uncleanness, and it is hidden from them, they are guilty. If someone swears thoughtlessly to do anything, whether good or evil, and it is hidden from them, they are guilty when they realize it. When someone is guilty in any of these matters, they must confess their sin and bring a female lamb or goat as a sin offering. The priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.

If they cannot afford a lamb, they must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. The priest will offer the sin offering first, wringing off its head but not severing it completely, and sprinkle some of the blood on the side of the altar. The rest of the blood will be drained at the base of the altar. The second bird will be offered as a burnt offering according to the regulations. The priest will make atonement for the person's sin, and they will be forgiven.

If they cannot afford two birds, they must bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. They must not put oil or frankincense on it, as it is a sin offering. The priest will take a handful of the flour as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar. The priest will make atonement for the person's sin, and they will be forgiven. The rest of the flour will belong to the priest, just like the grain offering.

If someone sins unintentionally in regard to any of the LORD's holy things, they must bring a ram without defect and the equivalent value in silver as a guilt offering. They must make restitution for what they have failed to do and add a fifth of the value to it, giving it to the priest. The priest will make atonement with the ram, and they will be forgiven.

If someone sins and does something forbidden by the LORD's commands, even if they are unaware of it, they are guilty and must bear the consequences. They must bring a ram without defect as a guilt offering. The priest will make atonement for the person's unintentional sin, and they will be forgiven. This is a guilt offering, as they have certainly committed a trespass against the LORD.

If someone sins by deceiving a neighbor about something entrusted to them, stolen, or found, or if they swear falsely about any such sin, they must make restitution in full, adding a fifth of the value to it, and give it to the owner on the day they present their guilt offering. They must bring a ram without defect as a guilt offering to the LORD. The priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.If someone commits a sin and needs to make amends, they must bring a ram from their flock as a guilt offering to the priest. The priest will make atonement for them before the LORD, and they will be forgiven for any wrongdoing.

The LORD spoke to Moses, instructing him to tell Aaron and his sons about the regulations for burnt offerings. The burnt offering must remain on the altar's fire all night until morning, and the fire must be kept burning. The priest will wear his linen garments and remove the ashes from the burnt offering, placing them beside the altar. He will then change his clothes and take the ashes outside the camp to a clean place. The fire on the altar must be kept burning continuously; it must not go out. Every morning, the priest will add wood to the fire, arrange the burnt offering, and burn the fat of the peace offerings on it. The fire must always be kept burning on the altar; it must never go out.

The regulations for the grain offering are as follows: Aaron's sons will present it before the LORD at the altar. The priest will take a handful of fine flour, oil, and all the frankincense from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as a memorial portion, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. Aaron and his sons will eat the remainder of the grain offering as unleavened bread in a holy place, within the courtyard of the tent of meeting. It must not be baked with yeast, as it is a portion of the offerings made by fire to the LORD, and it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. All male descendants of Aaron may eat it. This is a lasting ordinance for generations to come regarding the offerings made by fire to the LORD. Anyone who touches these offerings must be holy.

The LORD spoke to Moses, instructing him about the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the LORD on the day of their anointing: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half in the morning and half in the evening. It must be prepared with oil on a griddle and brought in well-mixed. The grain offering must be broken into pieces and offered as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. The priest who is anointed to succeed Aaron must offer it. This is a lasting ordinance; the entire grain offering must be burned and not eaten.

The LORD spoke to Moses about the regulations for the sin offering: It must be slaughtered in the same place as the burnt offering before the LORD, and it is most holy. The priest who offers it for sin will eat it in a holy place, within the courtyard of the tent of meeting. Anything that touches the flesh of the sin offering will become holy. If any of its blood is splashed on a garment, it must be washed in a holy place. A clay pot used to cook the sin offering must be broken, but if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot must be scoured and rinsed with water. Any male among the priests may eat it, as it is most holy. However, no sin offering whose blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place may be eaten; it must be burned.

The regulations for the guilt offering are as follows: It is most holy and must be slaughtered in the same place as the burnt offering. The priest will sprinkle its blood around the altar and offer all its fat, including the fat tail, the fat covering the internal organs, the kidneys, and the liver. The priest will burn these on the altar as a guilt offering. Every male among the priests may eat it in a holy place, as it is most holy. The same law applies to both the sin offering and the guilt offering; the priest who makes atonement with them will have a share. The priest who offers a burnt offering for anyone may keep the hide of the burnt offering. Every grain offering baked in an oven, cooked in a pan, or on a griddle belongs to the priest who offers it. All grain offerings, whether mixed with oil or dry, belong equally to all of Aaron's sons.

The regulations for the peace offering are as follows: If it is offered as a thanksgiving, it must be accompanied by unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour well-mixed with oil. Along with these cakes, leavened bread must be presented with the peace offering of thanksgiving. One of each kind of bread must be presented as a wave offering to the LORD and will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering. The meat of the peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the same day it is offered; none of it may be left until morning. If the peace offering is a vow or a voluntary offering, it may be eaten on the day it is offered and the next day, but any remaining meat on the third day must be burned. If any meat of the peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, and the person who offers it will not be credited; it will be considered impure, and anyone who eats it will bear the consequences of their sin. Any meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned. Anyone who is clean may eat the meat, but anyone who is unclean and eats the meat of the peace offering will be cut off from their people. Anyone who touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and then eats the meat of the peace offering, will be cut off from their people.

The LORD spoke to Moses, instructing him to tell the Israelites not to eat any fat from cattle, sheep, or goats. The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for other purposes, but it must not be eaten. Anyone who eats the fat of an animal presented as an offering made by fire to the LORD will be cut off from their people. The Israelites must not eat any blood, whether from birds or animals, in any of their dwellings. Anyone who eats any blood will be cut off from their people.

The LORD spoke to Moses, instructing him to tell the Israelites that anyone who offers a peace offering to the LORD must bring part of it as their sacrifice to the LORD. They must bring the fat with the breast, which will be waved as a wave offering before the LORD. The priest will burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons. The right thigh must be given to the priest as a contribution from the peace offerings. The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the peace offerings will have the right thigh as his share. The breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed are taken from the Israelites' peace offerings and given to Aaron and his sons as a perpetual share from the Israelites.

This is the portion of the offerings made by fire to the LORD that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests. The LORD commanded the Israelites to give this portion to them on the day they were anointed, as a perpetual share for generations to come.

These are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering, which the LORD gave to Moses on Mount Sinai when he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai.

The LORD spoke to Moses, instructing him to take Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread, and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Moses did as the LORD commanded, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting.Moses addressed the congregation, saying, "This is what the LORD has commanded us to do." He then brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water. Moses dressed Aaron in the coat, girdle, robe, and ephod, securing the ephod with its decorative belt. He placed the breastplate on Aaron, inserting the Urim and Thummim, and set the turban on his head, attaching the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD had instructed.

Moses anointed the tabernacle and everything in it with oil, sprinkling the altar seven times to consecrate it. He poured the anointing oil on Aaron's head to sanctify him. Moses also dressed Aaron's sons in coats, girdles, and caps, as the LORD commanded.

Next, Moses brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. Moses slaughtered it, applied its blood to the altar's horns, and poured the rest at the altar's base to purify it. He burned the fat, kidneys, and liver lobe on the altar, but the bull's hide, flesh, and dung were burned outside the camp.

Moses then brought the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. After slaughtering it, Moses sprinkled its blood around the altar, cut the ram into pieces, and burned the head, pieces, and fat. He washed the internal organs and legs with water and burned the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.

Moses brought the second ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. Moses slaughtered it and applied its blood to Aaron's right ear, thumb, and big toe, and did the same for Aaron's sons. He sprinkled the blood around the altar and took the fat, kidneys, liver lobe, and right shoulder, along with unleavened bread, oiled bread, and a wafer from the basket before the LORD. Moses placed these in Aaron's and his sons' hands and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD, then burned them on the altar.

Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering, as his portion from the ram of consecration. He sprinkled anointing oil and blood from the altar on Aaron and his sons, consecrating them and their garments. Moses instructed Aaron and his sons to boil the meat at the tabernacle entrance and eat it with the bread from the consecration basket, burning any leftovers.

They were to stay at the tabernacle entrance for seven days, completing their consecration, as the LORD commanded. Aaron and his sons followed all the LORD's instructions given through Moses.

On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel. He instructed Aaron to offer a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, before the LORD. The Israelites were to bring a goat for a sin offering, a calf and lamb for a burnt offering, and a bull and ram for peace offerings, along with a grain offering mixed with oil, as the LORD would appear to them that day.

The congregation brought these offerings to the tabernacle, and Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded, and His glory will appear to you." Aaron offered the sin offering and burnt offering for himself, then for the people, as instructed. He also offered the peace offerings, and Aaron's sons presented the blood, which he sprinkled around the altar. Aaron lifted his hands, blessed the people, and came down from offering the sacrifices.

Moses and Aaron entered the tabernacle, then came out and blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all. Fire came from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and fat on the altar, causing the people to shout and fall on their faces.

Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to His command, and fire from the LORD consumed them. Moses told Aaron that the LORD had said He would be sanctified and glorified by those who approach Him, and Aaron remained silent. Moses instructed Mishael and Elzaphan to carry Nadab and Abihu's bodies outside the camp.

Moses told Aaron and his remaining sons not to mourn publicly, lest they die and bring wrath upon the people, but to let the whole house of Israel mourn the LORD's burning. They were not to leave the tabernacle entrance, as the LORD's anointing oil was upon them, and they obeyed.

The LORD instructed Aaron not to drink wine or strong drink when entering the tabernacle, to distinguish between holy and unholy, clean and unclean, and to teach the Israelites all the LORD's statutes given through Moses.Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, were instructed to eat the remaining grain offering without yeast beside the altar, as it was considered most holy. They were to eat it in a holy place because it was their share of the offerings made by fire to the LORD. They were also to eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering in a clean place, along with their sons and daughters, as these were their due portions from the peace offerings of the Israelites.

Moses then checked on the goat of the sin offering and found it had been burned. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, asking why they had not eaten the sin offering in the holy place as commanded, since it was most holy and given to them to bear the iniquity of the congregation and make atonement for them before the LORD. Aaron explained that they had offered their sin and burnt offerings before the LORD, but given the day's events, he questioned if it would have been acceptable to eat the sin offering. Moses was satisfied with Aaron's explanation.

The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, instructing them to tell the Israelites which animals they could eat. They could eat any animal that has a split hoof and chews the cud. However, they were not to eat animals like the camel, the coney, the hare, and the pig, as they were considered unclean. They were also instructed not to eat any sea creatures without fins and scales, as these were deemed an abomination.

Certain birds were also listed as unclean and not to be eaten, including the eagle, vulture, raven, owl, and others. Additionally, all flying insects that walk on all fours were considered unclean, except for those that have jointed legs for hopping, like locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers.

Anyone who touched the carcasses of these unclean animals would be unclean until evening and must wash their clothes. The same applied to anyone who carried their carcasses. Specific instructions were given for handling the carcasses of unclean animals, including breaking any earthen vessels they fell into and washing any wooden vessels.

The LORD also gave instructions regarding the purification of women after childbirth. A woman who gave birth to a son would be unclean for seven days and must be purified for thirty-three days. If she gave birth to a daughter, she would be unclean for two weeks and must be purified for sixty-six days. After the days of purification, she was to bring a lamb and a young pigeon or turtledove for a burnt offering and a sin offering to the priest, who would make atonement for her.

The LORD also provided guidelines for identifying and handling skin diseases, such as leprosy. If a person had a suspicious skin condition, they were to be brought to Aaron or one of his sons, the priests, who would examine the condition and determine if it was leprosy. If the condition was deeper than the skin and the hair in the affected area had turned white, it was considered leprosy, and the person would be pronounced unclean. If the condition was not deeper than the skin and the hair had not turned white, the person would be isolated for further observation.If someone has a skin condition that might be leprosy, the priest will examine them. If the condition hasn't spread after seven days, the person will be isolated for another seven days. If it still hasn't spread, the person is considered clean and must wash their clothes. However, if the condition spreads, the person is declared unclean.

If the skin condition is deeper than the skin and the hair in the area has turned white, it is leprosy, and the person is unclean. If the condition covers the entire body but turns white, the person is clean. If raw flesh appears, the person is unclean.

For boils that heal but leave a white or reddish spot, the priest will check if the spot is deeper than the skin and if the hair has turned white. If so, it is leprosy. If not, the person is isolated for seven days. If the spot spreads, the person is unclean. If it doesn't, the person is clean.

For burns that leave a white or reddish spot, the priest will check if the spot is deeper than the skin and if the hair has turned white. If so, it is leprosy. If not, the person is isolated for seven days. If the spot spreads, the person is unclean. If it doesn't, the person is clean.

If someone has a sore on their head or beard, the priest will check if it is deeper than the skin and if there is yellow hair. If so, it is leprosy. If not, the person is isolated for seven days. If the sore spreads, the person is unclean. If it doesn't, the person is clean.

If someone has white spots on their skin, the priest will check if they are darkish white. If so, it is just a freckle, and the person is clean.

If someone is bald, they are clean. If there is a reddish-white sore on the bald area, it is leprosy, and the person is unclean. The person must wear torn clothes, keep their head uncovered, cover their mouth, and shout "Unclean, unclean." They must live outside the camp.

If a garment has a greenish or reddish spot, it must be shown to the priest. If the spot spreads, the garment is unclean and must be burned. If the spot doesn't spread, the garment is washed and isolated for seven days. If the spot remains, the garment is unclean and must be burned. If the spot fades, the garment is washed again and is clean.

For the cleansing of a leper, the priest will take two live birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop. One bird is killed over running water. The living bird, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop are dipped in the blood of the killed bird. The blood is sprinkled on the person seven times, and the living bird is released. The person must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe in water to be clean.On the seventh day, the person must shave off all their hair, including their head, beard, and eyebrows. They must wash their clothes and bathe in water to be considered clean. On the eighth day, they need to bring two male lambs without defects, one year-old female lamb without defects, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil. The priest will present the person and these offerings before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle.

The priest will take one male lamb and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, waving them before the Lord. The lamb will be slaughtered in the holy place where sin and burnt offerings are killed. The priest will then take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right ear, right thumb, and right big toe of the person being cleansed. The priest will also pour some oil into his left hand, dip his right finger in it, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord. The remaining oil will be applied to the right ear, right thumb, and right big toe of the person, on top of the blood from the guilt offering. The rest of the oil will be poured on the person's head to make atonement.

The priest will then offer a sin offering to make atonement for the person's uncleanness, followed by the burnt offering and grain offering. If the person is poor and cannot afford these offerings, they can bring one male lamb for a guilt offering, one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil. They should also bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. The priest will follow the same procedure for these offerings.

If a house shows signs of mold, the owner must report it to the priest, who will inspect the house. If the mold is found in the walls, the house will be closed for seven days. If the mold spreads, the affected stones will be removed and discarded outside the city. The house will be scraped and replastered. If the mold reappears, the house will be declared unclean and demolished. If the mold does not spread, the house will be declared clean after a cleansing ritual involving two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop.

For any discharge from the body, the person is considered unclean. Anything they touch, sit on, or lie on becomes unclean. Anyone who touches them or their belongings must wash their clothes, bathe, and remain unclean until evening. If the person with the discharge spits on someone, that person must also wash their clothes, bathe, and remain unclean until evening. Any earthenware touched by the unclean person must be broken, and wooden items must be rinsed in water. After the discharge stops, the person must wait seven days, wash their clothes, bathe in running water, and bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest for a sin offering and a burnt offering.If a man has a discharge, he must be cleansed before the Lord. If a man has an emission of semen, he must wash his entire body with water and remain unclean until evening. Any clothing or leather that comes into contact with the semen must also be washed and remain unclean until evening. If a man and woman have sexual relations, they must both bathe in water and remain unclean until evening.

If a woman has her menstrual period, she is considered unclean for seven days. Anyone who touches her during this time will be unclean until evening. Anything she lies or sits on during her period will also be unclean. Anyone who touches her bed or anything she sits on must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. If a man has sexual relations with her during her period, he will be unclean for seven days, and any bed he lies on will be unclean.

If a woman has a discharge of blood outside of her menstrual period, she will be unclean for the duration of the discharge, just as during her period. Anything she lies or sits on will be unclean. Anyone who touches these things must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. Once she is cleansed from her discharge, she must wait seven days, then bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle. The priest will offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for her before the Lord.

This is how the Israelites are to be separated from their uncleanness so they do not defile the Tabernacle. These are the regulations for anyone with a discharge, anyone who has an emission of semen, a woman during her menstrual period, and anyone who touches them.

The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron's two sons, who died when they approached the Lord. The Lord instructed Moses to tell Aaron not to enter the Most Holy Place behind the curtain whenever he chooses, or he will die, because the Lord appears in the cloud over the atonement cover. Aaron must bring a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. He must wear the sacred linen tunic, linen undergarments, linen sash, and linen turban. He must bathe himself with water before putting them on.

Aaron must take two male goats from the Israelite community for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. He will offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household. He will then take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle. He will cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the Lord and the other for the scapegoat. The goat chosen for the Lord will be sacrificed as a sin offering, while the scapegoat will be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement and sent into the wilderness.

Aaron will then take the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his household. He will take a censer full of burning coals from the altar and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and bring them inside the curtain. He will put the incense on the fire before the Lord, and the smoke will cover the atonement cover above the tablets of the covenant law, so he will not die. He will then sprinkle some of the bull's blood with his finger on the front of the atonement cover and seven times before the atonement cover.

Next, he will slaughter the goat for the people's sin offering and take its blood behind the curtain to do with it as he did with the bull's blood. He will sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it. This will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He will do the same for the Tent of Meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness. No one is to be in the Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household, and the whole community of Israel.

He will then go out to the altar before the Lord and make atonement for it. He will take some of the bull's and goat's blood and put it on all the horns of the altar. He will sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.

When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he will bring forward the live goat. He will lay both hands on the goat's head and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and put them on the goat's head. He will send the goat away into the wilderness in the care of someone appointed for the task. The goat will carry all their sins to a remote place, and the man will release it in the wilderness.

Aaron will then go into the Tent of Meeting, take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and leave them there. He will bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his regular garments. Then he will come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering for the people to make atonement for himself and the people. He will also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.

The man who releases the scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward, he may come into the camp. The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh, and intestines are to be burned. The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward, he may come into the camp.

This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month, you must deny yourselves and do no work—whether native-born or a foreigner residing among you—because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the Lord, you will be clean from all your sins. It is a day of sabbath rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance. The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement. He is to put on the sacred linen garments and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, and for the priests and all the members of the community.

This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites. And it was done, as the Lord commanded Moses.

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: This is what the Lord has commanded: Any Israelite who sacrifices an ox, a lamb, or a goat in the camp or outside of it instead of bringing it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to present it as an offering to the Lord must be considered guilty of bloodshed; they have shed blood and must be cut off from their people. This is so the Israelites will bring their sacrifices they are now making in the open fields to the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to the priest and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings. The priest is to splash the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the Lord."The people of Israel must no longer offer their sacrifices to demons, which they have been following. This rule will last forever for all generations. Tell them that anyone from the house of Israel or any foreigner living among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice must bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle to present it to the Lord. If they don't, they will be cut off from their people.

Anyone from the house of Israel or any foreigner living among them who eats any blood will be opposed by the Lord and cut off from their people. The life of a creature is in its blood, and the blood is given to make atonement for your souls. Therefore, no one among you should eat blood, nor should any foreigner living among you eat blood.

If anyone from the house of Israel or any foreigner living among them hunts and catches an animal or bird that may be eaten, they must drain its blood and cover it with dust. The life of every creature is in its blood, so you must not eat the blood of any creature. Anyone who eats it will be cut off.

Anyone who eats an animal that died naturally or was torn by wild animals, whether they are native-born or a foreigner, must wash their clothes and bathe with water and will be unclean until evening. Then they will be clean. But if they do not wash their clothes and bathe, they will bear their guilt.

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Tell the Israelites: I am the Lord your God. Do not follow the practices of Egypt, where you used to live, or of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees. I am the Lord your God. Keep my statutes and my judgments, and you will live by them. I am the Lord.

No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the Lord. Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; do not have relations with her. Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife; that would dishonor your father. Do not have sexual relations with your sister, whether she is your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether born in the same house or elsewhere. Do not have sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; that would dishonor you. Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father; she is your sister. Do not have sexual relations with your father's sister; she is a close relative of your father. Do not have sexual relations with your mother's sister; she is a close relative of your mother. Do not dishonor your father's brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt. Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife. Do not have sexual relations with your brother's wife; that would dishonor your brother. Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not take your wife's sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is living. Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period. Do not have sexual relations with your neighbor's wife and defile yourself with her. Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the Lord. Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.

Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled. Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants. But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the foreigners residing among you must not do any of these detestable things, for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled. If you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you. Anyone who does any of these detestable things—such persons must be cut off from their people. Keep my requirements and do not follow any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you came, and do not defile yourselves with them. I am the Lord your God."

The Lord said to Moses, "Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy. Each of you must respect your mother and father, and you must observe my Sabbaths. I am the Lord your God. Do not turn to idols or make metal gods for yourselves. I am the Lord your God.

When you sacrifice a fellowship offering to the Lord, sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf. It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it or on the next day; anything left over until the third day must be burned up. If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is impure and will not be accepted. Whoever eats it will be held responsible because they have desecrated what is holy to the Lord; they must be cut off from their people.

When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the Lord your God.

Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not deceive one another. Do not swear falsely by my name and so profane the name of your God. I am the Lord. Do not defraud or rob your neighbor. Do not hold back the wages of a hired worker overnight. Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but fear your God. I am the Lord.

Do not pervert justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly. Do not go about spreading slander among your people. Do not do anything that endangers your neighbor's life. I am the Lord.

Do not hate a fellow Israelite in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in their guilt. Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord.

Keep my decrees. Do not mate different kinds of animals. Do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material. If a man has sexual relations with a woman who is a slave promised to another man but who has not been ransomed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. Yet they are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed. The man, however, must bring a ram to the entrance of the Tabernacle for a guilt offering to the Lord. The priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the Lord for the sin he has committed, and his sin will be forgiven.

When you enter the land and plant any kind of fruit tree, regard its fruit as forbidden. For three years you are to consider it forbidden; it must not be eaten. In the fourth year all its fruit will be holy, an offering of praise to the Lord. But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit. In this way, your harvest will be increased. I am the Lord your God.

Do not eat any meat with the blood still in it. Do not practice divination or seek omens. Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard. Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the Lord. Do not degrade your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will turn to prostitution and be filled with wickedness. Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am the Lord. Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.Respect the elderly and honor them. Show reverence for God. If a foreigner lives among you, treat them as you would a native and love them as yourself, remembering you were once foreigners in Egypt. Use honest measurements and weights. Follow all my laws and decrees.

Anyone who sacrifices their children to Molech must be put to death. If the community ignores this, I will turn against that person and their family. Anyone who consults with spirits or wizards will be cut off from their people. Be holy, for I am the Lord your God.

Anyone who curses their parents must be put to death. Adulterers, those who sleep with their father's wife, daughter-in-law, or same sex, and those who engage in bestiality must be put to death. Incestuous relationships are forbidden and punishable by death or being cut off from the community.

Follow my laws so the land you inhabit does not reject you as it did the previous nations. Distinguish between clean and unclean animals. Be holy because I, the Lord, am holy and have set you apart.

Anyone with a familiar spirit or who is a wizard must be put to death. Priests must not defile themselves by contact with the dead, except for close family. They must not shave their heads, cut their beards, or make cuts on their bodies. They must marry virgins, not prostitutes or divorced women. Priests with physical defects cannot offer sacrifices but can eat the holy food.

Priests must separate themselves from holy things if they are unclean. They must not eat anything that dies naturally or is torn by animals. Only priests and their households can eat holy food.If a priest's daughter marries someone outside the priestly family, she cannot eat the sacred offerings. However, if she becomes a widow or is divorced and has no children, and returns to live with her father, she may eat her father's food. No outsider is allowed to eat it. If someone eats a sacred offering by mistake, they must repay the value plus an additional fifth and give it to the priest. The sacred offerings of the Israelites must not be desecrated, as they are holy to the Lord.

The Lord spoke to Moses, instructing him to tell Aaron and his sons, as well as all the Israelites, that any offering made to the Lord must be a male without defect from cattle, sheep, or goats. Any animal with a defect is not acceptable. Peace offerings must also be without blemish to be accepted. Animals that are blind, injured, or deformed, or have sores, scabs, or other defects, must not be offered to the Lord. 

A bull or lamb with an overgrown or stunted part may be offered as a freewill offering but not for a vow. Animals that are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut must not be offered to the Lord. Offerings from foreigners are not acceptable if they have defects.

The Lord also instructed that when a calf, lamb, or goat is born, it must stay with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day onward, it is acceptable as an offering. Do not slaughter an animal and its offspring on the same day. When offering a thanksgiving sacrifice, it must be eaten on the same day; none should be left until the next day.

The Lord emphasized the importance of keeping His commandments and not desecrating His holy name. He reminded the Israelites that He is the Lord who sanctifies them and brought them out of Egypt.

The Lord spoke to Moses about the appointed festivals, which are holy gatherings. The Sabbath is a day of rest and holy assembly, observed every seventh day. The Passover is on the fourteenth day of the first month, followed by the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days, during which no work is done on the first and seventh days.

When the Israelites enter the promised land and harvest its crops, they must bring the first sheaf to the priest, who will wave it before the Lord. On that day, they must offer a year-old lamb without defect, along with grain and drink offerings. They must not eat any bread or grain until they have made this offering.

The Feast of Weeks is observed seven weeks after the first sheaf is waved. On this day, they must present a new grain offering, including two loaves of bread made with yeast, seven lambs, one young bull, and two rams, along with their grain and drink offerings. A goat is offered as a sin offering, and two lambs as a peace offering. This day is a holy assembly, and no work is done.

During the harvest, the Israelites must leave the edges of their fields and any gleanings for the poor and foreigners.

The first day of the seventh month is a day of rest and trumpet blasts, followed by the Day of Atonement on the tenth day, a day of fasting and rest. Anyone who does not fast or works on this day will be cut off from the community.

The Feast of Tabernacles begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month and lasts for seven days. The first and eighth days are days of rest and holy assemblies. During this festival, the Israelites must live in temporary shelters to remember their ancestors' journey out of Egypt.

The Lord instructed Moses to command the Israelites to bring pure olive oil for the lamps in the tabernacle, ensuring they burn continually.The lamps in the tabernacle must be kept burning from evening until morning before the Lord continuously. This is a lasting ordinance for all generations. The priest will arrange the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord continually.

Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf. Arrange them in two rows, six in each row, on the pure gold table before the Lord. Place pure frankincense on each row as a memorial portion to be burned as an offering made by fire to the Lord. Every Sabbath, the bread is to be set out before the Lord continually, taken from the Israelites as a lasting covenant. Aaron and his sons are to eat it in a holy place, as it is most holy and part of the offerings made by fire to the Lord, a perpetual statute.

An Israelite woman's son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the Israelites and got into a fight with an Israelite man. The woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord and cursed. They brought him to Moses, and his mother's name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. They put him in custody until the Lord's will was made clear to them.

The Lord told Moses to take the blasphemer outside the camp. All who heard him were to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly was to stone him. Moses was to tell the Israelites that anyone who curses their God will bear their sin. Anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord must be put to death; the entire assembly must stone them, whether they are a foreigner or native-born. Anyone who takes a human life must be put to death. Anyone who takes the life of someone's animal must make restitution—life for life. If anyone injures their neighbor, whatever they have done must be done to them: fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The same injury they inflicted must be inflicted on them. Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death. You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the Lord your God.

Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.

The Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the Lord. For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops. But in the seventh year, the land is to have a year of Sabbath rest, a Sabbath to the Lord. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards. Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest. Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year will be food for you—for yourself, your male and female servants, the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you, as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.

Count off seven Sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven Sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years. Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land. Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan. The fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. For it is a Jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.

In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property. If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other. You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops. When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops. Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the Lord your God.

Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land. The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety. You may ask, "What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?" I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.

The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers. Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land. If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold. If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves, they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property. But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property.

Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time, the seller may redeem it. If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer's descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee. But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.

The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess. So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in any town they hold—and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.

If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you. Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you. You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.

If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves. They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors. Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves. Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.

Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.

If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner's clan, they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives may redeem them: an uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves. They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years. If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them. If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly. They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly.

Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee, for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.If someone sells themselves to you, treat them as hired workers, not as slaves. They will work for you until the Year of Jubilee, then they and their children will be freed and return to their family property. Israelites are my servants, whom I freed from Egypt; they must not be sold as slaves. Treat them fairly and with respect.

Do not make idols or set up images to worship. Keep my Sabbaths and respect my sanctuary. If you follow my commands, I will provide rain, fruitful harvests, and safety in your land. You will have plenty to eat and live in peace. I will remove dangerous animals and prevent wars. You will defeat your enemies, and I will bless you with prosperity and a strong covenant.

However, if you disobey, I will bring terror, disease, and sorrow. Your enemies will defeat you, and your efforts will be in vain. If you continue to disobey, I will punish you seven times more severely. Your pride will be broken, and your land will become barren. Wild animals will attack, and your population will dwindle. If you still resist, I will bring more plagues and disasters. Your cities will be destroyed, and you will be scattered among the nations.

If you confess your sins and humble yourselves, I will remember my covenant with your ancestors and restore the land. Even in exile, I will not abandon you completely. I will remember my covenant and be your God.

These are the laws and commands given by the Lord to the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai. If someone makes a vow to dedicate a person to the Lord, the value will be set according to age and gender. If they cannot afford the set value, the priest will determine an appropriate amount based on their ability to pay. If an animal is dedicated to the Lord, it becomes holy and cannot be exchanged. If someone wants to redeem a dedicated house or field, they must add a fifth of its value to the redemption price.If someone dedicates a field to the Lord after the Year of Jubilee, the priest will calculate its value based on the remaining years until the next Jubilee, and the value will be adjusted accordingly. If the person wants to redeem the field, they must add 20% to the estimated value. If they do not redeem it or if it has been sold to someone else, it cannot be redeemed again. During the Jubilee, the field will become holy to the Lord and will belong to the priests.

If someone dedicates a field they bought, not part of their family inheritance, the priest will determine its value up to the next Jubilee. The person must pay this value on that day as a holy offering to the Lord. In the Year of Jubilee, the field will return to the original owner. All valuations will be based on the sanctuary shekel, which is equivalent to twenty gerahs.

The firstborn of animals, which already belong to the Lord, cannot be dedicated. If it is an unclean animal, it can be redeemed at its estimated value plus 20%, or if not redeemed, it will be sold at its estimated value. Anything devoted to the Lord, whether a person, animal, or field, cannot be sold or redeemed; it is most holy to the Lord. No person devoted to destruction can be redeemed; they must be put to death.

A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain or fruit, belongs to the Lord and is holy. If someone wants to redeem any part of their tithe, they must add 20% to its value. Every tenth animal from the herd or flock that passes under the shepherd's rod will be holy to the Lord. No one may pick out the good from the bad or make any substitutions; if they do, both the original animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.

These are the commands the Lord gave Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.

The Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He instructed Moses to take a census of the entire Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one. All men twenty years old or older who could serve in the army were to be counted. Moses and Aaron were to enlist one man from each tribe to help with the census.

The chosen leaders were:
- From Reuben: Elizur son of Shedeur
- From Simeon: Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai
- From Judah: Nahshon son of Amminadab
- From Issachar: Nethaneel son of Zuar
- From Zebulun: Eliab son of Helon
- From Ephraim (Joseph's descendant): Elishama son of Ammihud
- From Manasseh (Joseph's descendant): Gamaliel son of Pedahzur
- From Benjamin: Abidan son of Gideoni
- From Dan: Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai
- From Asher: Pagiel son of Ocran
- From Gad: Eliasaph son of Deuel
- From Naphtali: Ahira son of Enan

These were the leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel. Moses and Aaron took these men, who were named, and assembled the whole community on the first day of the second month. They registered them by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one, from twenty years old and up, as the Lord commanded Moses.

The number of men from each tribe who could serve in the army were:
- Reuben: 46,500
- Simeon: 59,300
- Gad: 45,650
- Judah: 74,600
- Issachar: 54,400
- Zebulun: 57,400
- Ephraim: 40,500
- Manasseh: 32,200
- Benjamin: 35,400
- Dan: 62,700
- Asher: 41,500
- Naphtali: 53,400

These were the men counted by Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel, twelve men in total, each representing their ancestral tribe. The total number of men twenty years old or older who could serve in Israel's army was 603,550.

However, the Levites were not counted along with the other Israelites because the Lord had instructed Moses not to include them. Instead, the Levites were to be in charge of the tabernacle of the covenant law, all its furnishings, and everything belonging to it. They were to carry the tabernacle and all its articles, take care of it, and camp around it. When the tabernacle was to move, the Levites were to take it down, and when it was to be set up, they were to do it. Any unauthorized person who approached it was to be put to death. The Israelites were to set up their tents by divisions, each in their own camp under their standard. The Levites, however, were to camp around the tabernacle of the covenant law so that there would be no wrath on the Israelite community. The Levites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the covenant law.The Israelites followed all the Lord's commands given to Moses. The Lord then instructed Moses and Aaron that each man of Israel should set up camp under their family banner, at a distance around the Tabernacle. 

On the east side, the camp of Judah, led by Nahshon son of Amminadab, would set up first, with 74,600 men. Next to them, the tribe of Issachar, led by Nethaneel son of Zuar, with 54,400 men, and then the tribe of Zebulun, led by Eliab son of Helon, with 57,400 men. The total for the camp of Judah was 186,400 men, and they would lead the march.

On the south side, the camp of Reuben, led by Elizur son of Shedeur, with 46,500 men, followed by the tribe of Simeon, led by Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, with 59,300 men, and the tribe of Gad, led by Eliasaph son of Reuel, with 45,650 men. The total for the camp of Reuben was 151,450 men, and they would march second.

The Tabernacle, carried by the Levites, would be in the middle of the camps as they moved, with each tribe in their designated place.

On the west side, the camp of Ephraim, led by Elishama son of Ammihud, with 40,500 men, followed by the tribe of Manasseh, led by Gamaliel son of Pedahzur, with 32,200 men, and the tribe of Benjamin, led by Abidan son of Gideoni, with 35,400 men. The total for the camp of Ephraim was 108,100 men, and they would march third.

On the north side, the camp of Dan, led by Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai, with 62,700 men, followed by the tribe of Asher, led by Pagiel son of Ocran, with 41,500 men, and the tribe of Naphtali, led by Ahira son of Enan, with 53,400 men. The total for the camp of Dan was 157,600 men, and they would march last.

The total number of men in the Israelite camps was 603,550, not including the Levites, who were not counted as the Lord commanded Moses. The Israelites set up camp and moved according to the Lord's instructions.

The Lord also spoke to Moses about the generations of Aaron and Moses. Aaron's sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord when they offered unauthorized fire, leaving Eleazar and Ithamar to serve as priests.

The Lord instructed Moses to bring the tribe of Levi to assist Aaron. The Levites were to take care of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, and they were given to Aaron and his sons to serve in the priestly duties. Any unauthorized person approaching the Tabernacle would be put to death.

The Lord claimed the Levites as His own, instead of the firstborn of Israel, as He had spared the firstborn during the plague in Egypt. Moses was to count the Levites by their families, from one month old and up.

The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Gershon's sons were Libni and Shimei. Kohath's sons were Amram, Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. The Gershonites, numbering 7,500, camped west of the Tabernacle. Their duties included the Tabernacle's coverings and hangings. The Kohathites, numbering 8,600, camped south of the Tabernacle and were responsible for the sanctuary's holy items. The Merarites, numbering 6,200, camped north of the Tabernacle and took care of its structure and accessories. Eleazar, son of Aaron, oversaw the Levites' duties.Moses, Aaron, and his sons were responsible for the sanctuary and camped on the east side of the Tabernacle. Any unauthorized person approaching the sanctuary would be put to death. The total number of Levites, counted by Moses and Aaron as commanded by the Lord, was 22,000 males from one month old and up.

The Lord instructed Moses to count all the firstborn males of the Israelites from one month old and up. The total number was 22,273. The Lord claimed the Levites and their cattle in place of the firstborn of Israel and their cattle. For the 273 firstborn Israelites exceeding the number of Levites, Moses was to collect five shekels each and give the money to Aaron and his sons. Moses collected 1,365 shekels and gave it to Aaron and his sons as commanded by the Lord.

The Lord then instructed Moses and Aaron to count the Kohathites, a subgroup of the Levites, from ages 30 to 50, who were to work in the Tabernacle. Their duties included handling the most holy items. Aaron and his sons would cover these items before the Kohathites transported them, ensuring they did not touch or see the holy objects directly, lest they die. Eleazar, Aaron's son, was responsible for the oil, incense, daily offerings, and oversight of the Tabernacle.

The Lord also instructed Moses to count the Gershonites, another subgroup of the Levites, from ages 30 to 50. Their duties included carrying the Tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and hangings. Ithamar, Aaron's son, oversaw their work.

Similarly, the Merarites, the third subgroup of the Levites, were counted from ages 30 to 50. They were responsible for the Tabernacle's structure, including boards, bars, pillars, and sockets. Ithamar also oversaw their duties.

The total number of Levites counted for service in the Tabernacle was 8,580. Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel conducted the census as commanded by the Lord.Moses followed the Lord's command and counted each person according to their duties. The Lord then instructed Moses to tell the Israelites to remove anyone with leprosy, any discharge, or anyone who had touched a dead body from the camp to keep it pure. The Israelites obeyed.

The Lord also told Moses that if anyone sins, they must confess and make restitution, adding a fifth of the value, and give it to the wronged person. If the wronged person has no relative, the restitution goes to the Lord and the priest, along with a ram for atonement.

The Lord gave Moses instructions for dealing with a wife suspected of infidelity. The husband would bring her to the priest with an offering. The priest would prepare a bitter water mixture and make the woman take an oath. If she was guilty, the water would cause her harm; if innocent, she would be unharmed and able to conceive.

The Lord also provided guidelines for those taking a Nazarite vow, which included abstaining from wine, not cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with the dead. If they accidentally became defiled, they had to undergo a cleansing process and offer sacrifices.

When the vow period ended, the Nazarite would present offerings, shave their head, and the priest would perform specific rituals. The Lord instructed Moses to have Aaron and his sons bless the Israelites with a special blessing.

On the day Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, the leaders of Israel brought offerings, including six covered wagons and twelve oxen, to be used by the Levites for their service.Moses distributed the wagons and oxen among the Levites according to their duties: two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites, and four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites. The Kohathites received none because they carried the sanctuary items on their shoulders.

Each tribal leader brought offerings for the altar dedication. On the first day, Nahshon from Judah offered a silver plate and bowl filled with fine flour mixed with oil, a gold spoon of incense, a young bull, a ram, a lamb, a goat for a sin offering, and various animals for peace offerings.

On the second day, Nethaneel from Issachar brought similar offerings. Each subsequent day, a different leader from each tribe presented the same types of offerings: silver and gold vessels, fine flour, incense, and various animals for burnt, sin, and peace offerings.

This continued for twelve days, with each leader from the tribes of Zebulun, Reuben, Simeon, Gad, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali offering the same items.

In total, the offerings included twelve silver plates, twelve silver bowls, twelve gold spoons, twelve bulls, twelve rams, twelve lambs, twelve goats for sin offerings, and numerous animals for peace offerings.

After the altar was dedicated, Moses entered the Tabernacle to speak with the Lord and heard His voice from above the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant.The Lord spoke to Moses, instructing him to tell Aaron to light the seven lamps so they shine in front of the lampstand. Aaron did as commanded, lighting the lamps as the Lord had instructed Moses. The lampstand was made of hammered gold, crafted exactly as the Lord had shown Moses.

The Lord then told Moses to purify the Levites. This involved sprinkling them with purifying water, shaving their bodies, and washing their clothes. They were to bring a young bull with a grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and another young bull for a sin offering. Moses was to gather the entire community of Israel, bring the Levites before the Lord, and have the Israelites lay their hands on them. Aaron would then present the Levites as an offering to the Lord, so they could serve Him.

The Levites were to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, offering one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for them. Moses was to present the Levites before Aaron and his sons as an offering to the Lord, separating them from the rest of the Israelites. The Levites would then be dedicated to the Lord and begin their service in the Tabernacle.

The Lord explained that the Levites were His, taken instead of the firstborn of all Israelites. He had sanctified the firstborn on the day He struck down the firstborn in Egypt, but now He had taken the Levites in their place. The Levites were given to Aaron and his sons to serve in the Tabernacle and make atonement for the Israelites, preventing any plague when they approached the sanctuary.

Moses, Aaron, and the Israelites did as the Lord commanded, purifying the Levites and presenting them as an offering. The Levites then began their service in the Tabernacle.

The Lord also instructed Moses that Levites aged 25 to 50 were to serve in the Tabernacle. After 50, they would retire from active service but could assist their fellow Levites in their duties.

The Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, instructing the Israelites to keep the Passover at its appointed time, on the 14th day of the first month. They were to follow all the rites and ceremonies. Some men who were unclean due to contact with a dead body asked Moses if they could still observe Passover. The Lord told Moses that anyone unclean or on a journey could observe Passover on the 14th day of the second month, following the same rules. However, anyone who was clean and not on a journey but failed to observe Passover would be cut off from the community.

On the day the Tabernacle was set up, a cloud covered it, appearing as fire by night. The Israelites followed the cloud's movements, setting up camp when it rested and moving when it lifted. This pattern continued throughout their journey.

The Lord instructed Moses to make two silver trumpets for calling the assembly and signaling the camps to move. When both trumpets were blown, the entire assembly would gather at the Tabernacle. If only one was blown, the leaders would gather. Different signals indicated when the eastern and southern camps should move. The sons of Aaron, the priests, were to blow the trumpets as a lasting ordinance. The trumpets were also to be used in times of war and on special occasions, such as festivals and new moons, to remind the Israelites of the Lord.

On the 20th day of the second month in the second year, the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle, and the Israelites set out from the wilderness of Sinai, following the Lord's command. The camp of Judah, led by Nahshon son of Amminadab, was the first to set out.The leader of the tribe of Issachar was Nethaneel, son of Zuar. The leader of the tribe of Zebulun was Eliab, son of Helon. When the Tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and Merari carried it. The camp of Reuben, led by Elizur, son of Shedeur, set out next. The tribe of Simeon was led by Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai, and the tribe of Gad by Eliasaph, son of Deuel. The Kohathites carried the sanctuary, and the Tabernacle was set up before they arrived.

The camp of Ephraim, led by Elishama, son of Ammihud, set out next, followed by the tribe of Manasseh, led by Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, and the tribe of Benjamin, led by Abidan, son of Gideoni. The camp of Dan, which was the rear guard, was led by Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai. The tribe of Asher was led by Pagiel, son of Ocran, and the tribe of Naphtali by Ahira, son of Enan. This was the order in which the Israelites traveled.

Moses invited Hobab, son of Raguel the Midianite and his father-in-law, to join them on their journey to the land the Lord had promised. Hobab initially refused, wanting to return to his own land and people. Moses urged him to stay, promising that he would share in the blessings the Lord would give them. They traveled for three days, with the Ark of the Covenant leading the way to find a resting place. The cloud of the Lord was over them by day as they traveled.

When the Ark set out, Moses would say, "Rise up, Lord! Scatter your enemies and make those who hate you flee." When it came to rest, he would say, "Return, Lord, to the many thousands of Israel."

The people began to complain, which angered the Lord, and His fire burned among them, consuming some at the outskirts of the camp. The people cried out to Moses, who prayed to the Lord, and the fire died down. The place was named Taberah because the Lord's fire had burned among them.

A mixed group among them began to crave other food, and the Israelites started to complain, reminiscing about the variety of food they had in Egypt. They were tired of the manna, which was like coriander seed and tasted like cakes baked with fresh oil. The manna fell with the dew at night.

Moses heard the people weeping at the entrances of their tents, and the Lord's anger was greatly kindled. Moses was also displeased and asked the Lord why he had been given the burden of all these people. He felt unable to provide meat for them and asked the Lord to relieve him of this burden, even if it meant death.

The Lord instructed Moses to gather seventy elders known to be leaders and officials among the people. The Lord would take some of the spirit that was on Moses and put it on them so they could share the burden. The Lord also promised to provide meat for the people, not just for a day or two, but for a whole month, until they loathed it, because they had rejected the Lord.

Moses questioned how this could be done, given the vast number of people. The Lord assured him that His power was not limited and that Moses would see His word fulfilled. Moses gathered the seventy elders, and the Lord came down in a cloud, took some of the spirit on Moses, and put it on the elders. They prophesied but did not continue to do so.

Two men, Eldad and Medad, who were listed among the elders but had not gone to the Tabernacle, also received the spirit and prophesied in the camp. A young man reported this to Moses, and Joshua, Moses' assistant, asked Moses to stop them. Moses replied that he wished all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put His spirit on them.

A wind from the Lord brought quail from the sea, and they fell around the camp. The people gathered quail all day and night and the next day. While the meat was still between their teeth, the Lord's anger burned against them, and He struck them with a severe plague. The place was named Kibroth Hattaavah because they buried the people who had craved other food. The Israelites then traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.

Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of his Cushite wife. They questioned whether the Lord had spoken only through Moses and not also through them. The Lord heard this and called Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to the Tabernacle. He came down in a pillar of cloud and called Aaron and Miriam forward. The Lord explained that He spoke to prophets through visions and dreams, but with Moses, He spoke face to face. The Lord's anger burned against them, and when the cloud lifted, Miriam was leprous, white as snow. Aaron pleaded with Moses not to hold their sin against them. Moses cried out to the Lord to heal her.Moses cried out to God, "Please heal her!" The Lord responded, "If her father had spit in her face, wouldn't she be in disgrace for seven days? Let her be isolated outside the camp for seven days, and then she can be brought back." So Miriam was isolated outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move until she was brought back. After that, they left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.

The Lord spoke to Moses, instructing him to send men to explore the land of Canaan, which He was giving to the Israelites. Each tribe was to send one leader. Moses followed the Lord's command and sent the leaders from the wilderness of Paran. These were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; from Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; from Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; from Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; from Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; from Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; from Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; from Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; from Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; from Asher, Sethur son of Michael; from Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; and from Gad, Geuel son of Machi. Moses renamed Hoshea son of Nun to Joshua.

Moses sent them to explore Canaan, instructing them to go through the Negev and into the hill country. He told them to observe the land and its people, whether they were strong or weak, few or many, and to assess the quality of the land and the cities, whether they were camps or fortified. He also asked them to bring back some of the fruit of the land, as it was the season for the first ripe grapes.

The men went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo Hamath. They went through the Negev and reached Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak, lived. Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt. At the Valley of Eshkol, they cut a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two men, along with some pomegranates and figs. The place was named the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut there.

After forty days, they returned from exploring the land and reported back to Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community at Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran. They showed them the fruit of the land and reported, "We went to the land you sent us to. It does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."

Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it." But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are." They spread a bad report among the Israelites about the land they had explored, saying, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."

That night, all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud. They grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, "If only we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness! Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?" They said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."

Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly. Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good. If the Lord is pleased with us, He will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us. Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us. Do not be afraid of them."

But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites. The Lord said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, despite all the signs I have performed among them? I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."

Moses said to the Lord, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power, you brought these people up from among them. And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, Lord, are with these people and that you, Lord, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say, 'The Lord was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.'

"Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared: 'The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.' In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."

The Lord replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked. Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the Lord fills the whole earth, not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times—not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it. But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it. Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea."

The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites. So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say: In this wilderness, your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me. Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected. But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.' I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die."

So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it—these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the Lord. Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.The Israelites mourned deeply. Early the next morning, they went up to the top of the mountain, saying, "We are here and will go to the place the Lord promised, for we have sinned." But Moses warned them, "Why are you disobeying the Lord's command? It won't succeed. Don't go up, for the Lord is not with you, and you will be defeated by your enemies. The Amalekites and Canaanites are there, and you will fall by the sword because you have turned away from the Lord."

Despite Moses' warning, they went up to the hilltop, but neither the Ark of the Covenant nor Moses left the camp. The Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that hill came down and attacked them, defeating them as far as Hormah.

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Tell the Israelites: When you enter the land I am giving you and you make an offering by fire to the Lord, whether a burnt offering, a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, a freewill offering, or during your festivals, to create a pleasing aroma to the Lord from the herd or flock, the one presenting the offering must also bring a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil. Also, prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering with the burnt offering or sacrifice for each lamb. For a ram, prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil, and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. For a bull, prepare a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil, and half a hin of wine as a drink offering. This is how you must prepare each offering, whether for a bull, ram, lamb, or young goat. Do this for each animal you offer.

Everyone born in the land must follow these instructions when presenting an offering by fire to the Lord. If a foreigner lives among you and wants to present an offering by fire to the Lord, they must do the same. There is one law for both you and the foreigner living among you, a lasting ordinance for all generations. The same laws and regulations apply to both you and the foreigner living among you."

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Tell the Israelites: When you enter the land I am bringing you into, and you eat the bread of the land, you must present a portion as an offering to the Lord. Present a loaf from the first of your dough as an offering, just as you present an offering from the threshing floor. Throughout your generations, give the first of your dough to the Lord as an offering.

If you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the Lord gave Moses, from the day the Lord gave them and onward, the whole community must offer a young bull as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord, along with its grain and drink offerings, and a male goat as a sin offering. The priest will make atonement for the entire Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was unintentional. They must bring their offering, a sacrifice by fire to the Lord, and their sin offering before the Lord for their unintentional sin. The entire Israelite community and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven, for it was unintentional.

If an individual sins unintentionally, they must bring a year-old female goat as a sin offering. The priest will make atonement for the person who sinned unintentionally, and they will be forgiven. There is one law for anyone who sins unintentionally, whether native-born or a foreigner living among you.

But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or a foreigner, blasphemes the Lord and must be cut off from their people. They have despised the Lord's word and broken His command; they must be cut off, and their guilt remains on them."

While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. Those who found him brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community. They kept him in custody because it was unclear what should be done to him. The Lord said to Moses, "The man must be put to death; the whole community must stone him outside the camp." So the community took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the Lord commanded Moses.

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Tell the Israelites to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations and to put a blue cord on each tassel. These tassels will remind you to obey all the Lord's commands and not follow your own heart and eyes, which lead you astray. You will remember to obey all my commands and be holy to your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God."

Korah, son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On, son of Peleth, from the tribe of Reuben, took men and rose up against Moses. They were joined by 250 Israelite men, leaders of the community, well-known and respected. They confronted Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the Lord is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the Lord's assembly?"

When Moses heard this, he fell facedown. He said to Korah and all his followers, "In the morning, the Lord will show who belongs to Him and who is holy, and He will have that person come near Him. The one He chooses, He will bring near to Him. You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers, put fire and incense in them before the Lord tomorrow. The man the Lord chooses will be the holy one. You Levites have gone too far!"

Moses also said to Korah, "Listen, you Levites! Isn't it enough that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near Himself to do the work at the Lord's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them? He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near Himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too. It is against the Lord that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"

Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come! Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us! Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!"

Moses became very angry and said to the Lord, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."

Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the Lord tomorrow—you and they and Aaron. Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the Lord. You and Aaron are to present your censers also." So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting. When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire assembly. The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"Moses and Aaron pleaded with God, asking if He would punish the entire community for one man's sin. God instructed Moses to tell the people to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Moses warned the people to avoid anything belonging to these men to avoid being caught in their sins. The people moved away, and Dathan and Abiram stood at their tents with their families. Moses declared that if these men died naturally, then God had not sent him. But if the earth swallowed them alive, it would be a sign that they had defied God.

As soon as Moses finished speaking, the ground split open and swallowed Korah, Dathan, Abiram, their families, and all their possessions. The earth closed over them, and they were gone. The Israelites fled in fear, worried they might also be swallowed. Then, fire from the Lord consumed the 250 men who had offered incense.

God told Moses to instruct Eleazar, Aaron's son, to collect the censers from the fire and hammer them into a covering for the altar, as a reminder that only descendants of Aaron should offer incense before the Lord. The censers were considered holy because they had been offered to God.

The next day, the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron, accusing them of killing God's people. As the community gathered against them, the glory of the Lord appeared. God told Moses and Aaron to separate themselves from the assembly so He could destroy them. Moses and Aaron fell facedown and pleaded for the people. Moses instructed Aaron to take a censer with fire from the altar and incense to make atonement for the people, as a plague had begun. Aaron did as instructed and stood between the living and the dead, stopping the plague. However, 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who died because of Korah.

God then instructed Moses to collect a staff from each leader of the twelve tribes, with Aaron's name on the staff of Levi. The staffs were placed in the tent of meeting. The next day, Aaron's staff had budded, blossomed, and produced almonds, signifying God's choice of Aaron. The staffs were returned to their owners, and Aaron's staff was kept as a sign against the rebels to stop their complaints.

The Israelites expressed fear of dying if they approached the tabernacle. God told Aaron that he and his descendants would bear the responsibility for offenses against the sanctuary and priesthood. The Levites were given to assist the priests but were not to approach the sacred objects or altar. The Levites were a gift to the priests to help with the tabernacle's service. The priests were given the offerings and firstfruits as their portion, but they would have no inheritance in the land, as God was their inheritance.The Levites were given a tenth of all the produce in Israel as their inheritance for their service in the tabernacle. The Israelites were warned not to approach the tabernacle to avoid sin and death. The Levites were responsible for the tabernacle's service and would bear any iniquity. This rule was to be followed by all generations, and the Levites would have no land inheritance among the Israelites. Instead, they would receive the tithes offered by the Israelites to the Lord.

The Lord instructed Moses to tell the Levites that when they received tithes from the Israelites, they must offer a portion of it as a heave offering to the Lord, similar to the grain from the threshing floor or the wine from the winepress. This offering was to be given to Aaron the priest. The Levites were to offer the best part of their gifts as a heave offering to the Lord. Once they had done this, the remaining portion would be considered their reward for their service in the tabernacle. They would not bear sin for this as long as they offered the best part. They were also warned not to desecrate the holy offerings of the Israelites, or they would die.

The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron about the law regarding purification. The Israelites were to bring a red heifer without blemish, which had never been yoked, to Eleazar the priest. The heifer was to be slaughtered outside the camp, and Eleazar would sprinkle its blood seven times toward the tabernacle. The heifer, along with its skin, flesh, blood, and dung, was to be burned. Cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet were to be thrown into the fire. The priest would then wash his clothes and bathe, but he would remain unclean until evening. The ashes of the heifer were to be gathered and kept outside the camp for use in the water of purification for sin.

Anyone who touched a dead body would be unclean for seven days. They were to purify themselves with the water of purification on the third and seventh days. If they did not purify themselves, they would remain unclean and be cut off from Israel for defiling the Lord's sanctuary. This law applied to anyone who touched a dead body, a bone, or a grave. The ashes of the burnt heifer were to be mixed with running water and sprinkled on the unclean person, tent, and vessels. The clean person performing the sprinkling would also be unclean until evening. This statute was to be followed perpetually.

The Israelites arrived in the desert of Zin in the first month, and Miriam died and was buried there. There was no water, and the people complained against Moses and Aaron, wishing they had died earlier. They questioned why they were brought out of Egypt to die in the wilderness without food or water. Moses and Aaron went to the entrance of the tabernacle and fell facedown. The Lord instructed Moses to take his staff, gather the assembly, and speak to a rock to bring forth water. Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, and water gushed out for the people and their livestock.

However, because Moses and Aaron did not trust the Lord enough to honor Him as holy, they were told they would not lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. This place was called the Waters of Meribah because the Israelites quarreled with the Lord, and He showed His holiness among them.

Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, asking for permission to pass through their land. The king of Edom refused, threatening to attack if they tried. The Israelites offered to pay for any water they used, but Edom still refused and came out against them with a large army. The Israelites turned away and traveled to Mount Hor. The Lord told Moses and Aaron that Aaron would die there because of their rebellion at the Waters of Meribah. Moses was to take Aaron and his son Eleazar up the mountain, remove Aaron's garments, and put them on Eleazar. Aaron died on the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down.When the Israelites saw that Aaron had died, they mourned for him for thirty days. 

King Arad, a Canaanite who lived in the south, heard that Israel was approaching and attacked them, taking some prisoners. Israel made a vow to the Lord, promising to destroy the Canaanite cities if He delivered them into their hands. The Lord listened and helped Israel defeat the Canaanites, and they named the place Hormah.

The Israelites then traveled from Mount Hor towards the Red Sea to go around Edom. The journey was tough, and the people complained against God and Moses, lamenting their lack of food and water. In response, the Lord sent venomous snakes among them, which bit and killed many Israelites. The people admitted their sin and asked Moses to pray for them. The Lord instructed Moses to make a bronze snake and put it on a pole; anyone bitten could look at it and live. Moses did as instructed, and those who looked at the bronze snake were healed.

The Israelites continued their journey, camping at various locations including Oboth, Ije Abarim, the Zered Valley, and the Arnon River. They reached a place called Beer, where the Lord provided water after Moses gathered the people. The Israelites sang a song of praise for the well.

They then moved to Mattanah, Nahaliel, Bamoth, and finally to the top of Pisgah, overlooking the desert. Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, asking for permission to pass through his land peacefully. Sihon refused and attacked Israel, but Israel defeated him and took over his land, including the city of Heshbon.

Moses sent spies to scout out Jazer, and Israel captured its villages and drove out the Amorites. They then turned towards Bashan, where King Og and his army confronted them. The Lord assured Moses not to fear, as He would deliver Og into their hands. Israel defeated Og and took possession of his land.

The Israelites camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan River, across from Jericho. Balak, the king of Moab, saw what Israel had done to the Amorites and was terrified. He sent messengers to Balaam, a diviner, asking him to curse Israel. Balaam initially refused, but after further persuasion and a message from God, he agreed to go with the Moabite princes. However, God was angry with Balaam for going, and an angel blocked his path. Balaam's donkey saw the angel and refused to move, causing Balaam to beat it. The Lord opened the donkey's mouth, and it spoke to Balaam, questioning his actions. Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel, who rebuked him for his reckless path.The angel of the Lord confronted Balaam, saying, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I came to oppose you because your path is reckless. The donkey saw me and turned away three times. If she hadn't, I would have killed you and spared her." Balaam admitted his sin, saying he didn't realize the angel was blocking his way. The angel instructed him to continue with Balak's men but to only speak the words given by God.

When Balak heard Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at the border of Moab. Balak questioned why Balaam didn't come sooner, promising him honor. Balaam replied that he could only speak the words God put in his mouth. They went to Kirjathhuzoth, where Balak offered oxen and sheep. The next day, Balak took Balaam to the high places of Baal to see the Israelites.

Balaam instructed Balak to build seven altars and prepare seven bulls and rams. Balak did so, and they offered the sacrifices. Balaam then went to a high place to meet the Lord. God met Balaam and put words in his mouth, instructing him to return to Balak and speak them. Balaam returned and delivered God's message, blessing Israel instead of cursing them.

Balak was frustrated and took Balaam to another location, hoping he could curse Israel from there. They repeated the process of building altars and offering sacrifices. Again, Balaam met with God, who put words in his mouth. Balaam returned and delivered another blessing for Israel.

Balak, increasingly frustrated, took Balaam to a third location. They built more altars and offered more sacrifices. This time, Balaam didn't seek enchantments but looked toward the wilderness. The Spirit of God came upon him, and he blessed Israel again, praising their strength and prosperity.

Balak was furious and told Balaam to leave, saying he had intended to honor him, but the Lord had kept him from it. Balaam reminded Balak that he could only speak the words God gave him. Before leaving, Balaam prophesied the future victories of Israel over their enemies.

After Balaam left, the Israelites stayed in Shittim, where they began to engage in immoral behavior with Moabite women and worship their gods. This angered the Lord, who instructed Moses to execute those who had joined in idolatry. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, took decisive action by killing an Israelite man and a Midianite woman, stopping the plague that had struck the Israelites.Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest, took a spear and followed the Israelite man into his tent. He killed both the man and the Midianite woman, stopping the plague that had killed 24,000 Israelites. God told Moses that Phinehas had turned away His anger from the Israelites by being zealous for God's honor. As a reward, God granted Phinehas and his descendants a covenant of peace and an everlasting priesthood.

The Israelite man who was killed was Zimri, a leader from the tribe of Simeon, and the Midianite woman was Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader. God then instructed Moses to attack the Midianites because they had deceived the Israelites into worshiping Baal of Peor and engaging in immoral behavior.

After the plague, God told Moses and Eleazar, the son of Aaron, to take a census of all the Israelites aged 20 and older who could serve in the army. They conducted the census in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho. The census included the following:

- The tribe of Reuben, with 43,730 men.
- The tribe of Simeon, with 22,200 men.
- The tribe of Gad, with 40,500 men.
- The tribe of Judah, with 76,500 men.
- The tribe of Issachar, with 64,300 men.
- The tribe of Zebulun, with 60,500 men.
- The tribe of Manasseh, with 52,700 men.
- The tribe of Ephraim, with 32,500 men.
- The tribe of Benjamin, with 45,600 men.
- The tribe of Dan, with 64,400 men.
- The tribe of Asher, with 53,400 men.
- The tribe of Naphtali, with 45,400 men.

In total, there were 601,730 men eligible for military service. God instructed Moses to divide the land among the tribes based on the number of people in each tribe, with larger tribes receiving more land and smaller tribes receiving less. The land was to be divided by lot.

The Levites, who were not included in the main census because they had no inheritance of land, were also counted. The Levite families included the Gershonites, Kohathites, and Merarites, with a total of 23,000 males from a month old and upward.

None of the men counted in this census had been part of the previous census taken in the wilderness of Sinai, except for Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, the son of Nun, as God had decreed that the previous generation would die in the wilderness.Zelophehad, a descendant of Manasseh, had five daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community at the entrance of the Tabernacle. They said, "Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among those who rebelled against the Lord with Korah, but he died for his own sin and left no sons. Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father's relatives."

Moses brought their case before the Lord, and the Lord said to him, "The daughters of Zelophehad are right. You must give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives and transfer their father's inheritance to them. Tell the Israelites that if a man dies and leaves no son, his inheritance should be given to his daughter. If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers. If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers. If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, so that he may possess it. This is to be a legal requirement for the Israelites, as the Lord commanded Moses."

The Lord then told Moses to go up Mount Abarim and see the land He had given to the Israelites. After seeing it, Moses would be gathered to his people, just as Aaron had been, because Moses had disobeyed God's command in the Desert of Zin.

Moses asked the Lord to appoint a leader over the community so they would not be like sheep without a shepherd. The Lord chose Joshua, son of Nun, a man filled with the Spirit. Moses was to lay his hands on Joshua and present him to Eleazar the priest and the entire community, giving him some of his authority so the Israelites would obey him. Joshua would consult Eleazar, who would use the Urim to seek the Lord's decision. At his command, the Israelites would go out and come in.

Moses did as the Lord commanded. He took Joshua, presented him to Eleazar and the community, laid his hands on him, and commissioned him as the Lord had instructed.

The Lord then spoke to Moses about the offerings the Israelites were to present at the appointed times. They were to offer two unblemished year-old lambs daily as a regular burnt offering, one in the morning and one at twilight, along with a grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil and a drink offering of wine. On the Sabbath, they were to offer two additional lambs, along with the corresponding grain and drink offerings.

At the beginning of each month, they were to offer two young bulls, one ram, and seven unblemished year-old lambs, along with the appropriate grain and drink offerings. They were also to offer a male goat as a sin offering.

On the fourteenth day of the first month, they were to celebrate the Passover. On the fifteenth day, the Feast of Unleavened Bread would begin, lasting seven days. On the first day, they were to hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. They were to offer two young bulls, one ram, and seven unblemished year-old lambs, along with the appropriate grain and drink offerings, and a male goat as a sin offering. This pattern was to be followed for seven days, with a sacred assembly on the seventh day.

On the day of firstfruits, when they presented a new grain offering to the Lord, they were to hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. They were to offer two young bulls, one ram, and seven unblemished year-old lambs, along with the appropriate grain and drink offerings, and a male goat as a sin offering.

On the first day of the seventh month, they were to hold a sacred assembly, do no regular work, and commemorate the day with trumpet blasts. They were to offer one young bull, one ram, and seven unblemished year-old lambs, along with the appropriate grain and drink offerings, and a male goat as a sin offering.

On the tenth day of the seventh month, they were to hold a sacred assembly, fast, and do no work. They were to offer one young bull, one ram, and seven unblemished year-old lambs, along with the appropriate grain and drink offerings, and a male goat as a sin offering.

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, they were to hold a sacred assembly and celebrate a festival to the Lord for seven days. They were to offer thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen unblemished year-old lambs, along with the appropriate grain and drink offerings, and a male goat as a sin offering. This pattern was to be followed for seven days, with the number of bulls decreasing by one each day, and a sacred assembly on the eighth day.On the third day, offer eleven bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old lambs without blemish. Each animal should have its corresponding grain and drink offerings. Additionally, offer one goat as a sin offering, along with the regular burnt offering and its grain and drink offerings.

On the fourth day, offer ten bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old lambs without blemish, with their respective grain and drink offerings. Also, offer one goat as a sin offering, along with the regular burnt offering and its grain and drink offerings.

On the fifth day, offer nine bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old lambs without blemish, with their respective grain and drink offerings. Also, offer one goat as a sin offering, along with the regular burnt offering and its grain and drink offerings.

On the sixth day, offer eight bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old lambs without blemish, with their respective grain and drink offerings. Also, offer one goat as a sin offering, along with the regular burnt offering and its grain and drink offerings.

On the seventh day, offer seven bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old lambs without blemish, with their respective grain and drink offerings. Also, offer one goat as a sin offering, along with the regular burnt offering and its grain and drink offerings.

On the eighth day, hold a solemn assembly and do no regular work. Offer one bull, one ram, and seven one-year-old lambs without blemish, with their respective grain and drink offerings. Also, offer one goat as a sin offering, along with the regular burnt offering and its grain and drink offerings.

These offerings are to be made to the Lord during your appointed festivals, in addition to your vows and freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink offerings, and peace offerings.

Moses conveyed all these commands from the Lord to the Israelites.

Moses also spoke to the leaders of the tribes of Israel about vows. If a man makes a vow to the Lord or swears an oath to bind himself, he must not break his word and must do everything he said.

If a young woman makes a vow to the Lord while living in her father's house, and her father hears it and says nothing, her vow stands. But if her father disallows it when he hears it, her vow does not stand, and the Lord will forgive her.

If a woman makes a vow or binds herself with an oath after marriage, and her husband hears it and says nothing, her vow stands. But if her husband disallows it when he hears it, her vow does not stand, and the Lord will forgive her.

A widow or a divorced woman must fulfill any vow she makes.

If a woman makes a vow in her husband's house, and her husband hears it and says nothing, her vow stands. But if her husband disallows it when he hears it, her vow does not stand, and the Lord will forgive her.

These are the regulations the Lord gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and his young daughter living in his house.

The Lord then instructed Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites before he would be gathered to his people. Moses told the Israelites to arm themselves for battle against the Midianites. Each tribe was to send a thousand men, totaling twelve thousand armed for war. Moses sent them to battle, along with Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest, who carried the holy instruments and trumpets.

The Israelites fought the Midianites as the Lord commanded and killed all the males, including the five kings of Midian and Balaam, son of Beor. They captured the women and children, took all the livestock and goods, and burned the Midianite cities and camps. They brought the captives, spoils, and plunder to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the Israelite community at the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho.

Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. Moses was angry with the officers of the army for sparing the women, who had led the Israelites into sin at Peor. He commanded them to kill every male child and every woman who had slept with a man, but to keep alive the young girls who had not slept with a man. The soldiers were to stay outside the camp for seven days to purify themselves and their captives, washing their clothes on the third and seventh days.

Eleazar the priest instructed the soldiers on the purification laws for metals. Items that could withstand fire were to be purified by fire and water, while other items were to be purified with water. After washing their clothes on the seventh day, they would be clean and could re-enter the camp.

The Lord then told Moses to count the spoils of war, including people and animals, and divide them between the soldiers who fought and the rest of the community. A tribute was to be taken from the soldiers' share for the Lord, and from the community's share for the Levites who maintained the Lord's tabernacle. Moses and Eleazar followed these instructions.The remaining spoils of war, which the soldiers had captured, included 675,000 sheep, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 women who had never been with a man. Half of these spoils were given to the soldiers who fought, totaling 337,500 sheep, 36,000 cattle, 30,500 donkeys, and 16,000 women. From this, the Lord's tribute was 675 sheep, 72 cattle, 61 donkeys, and 32 women. Moses gave this tribute to Eleazar the priest as the Lord commanded.

The other half of the spoils, which belonged to the rest of the Israelites, included 337,500 sheep, 36,000 cattle, 30,500 donkeys, and 16,000 women. From this half, Moses took one out of every fifty people and animals and gave them to the Levites who maintained the Lord's tabernacle, as the Lord commanded.

The officers of the army reported to Moses that none of their men were missing. They brought offerings of gold jewelry to the Lord as atonement for their souls. Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold, which totaled 16,750 shekels, and brought it into the tabernacle as a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord.

The tribes of Reuben and Gad, who had large herds of cattle, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock. They asked Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community if they could settle there instead of crossing the Jordan River. Moses questioned if they would let their fellow Israelites go to war while they stayed behind, reminding them of the previous generation's failure to enter the promised land, which angered the Lord and led to forty years of wandering in the wilderness.

The Reubenites and Gadites promised to build pens for their livestock and cities for their families, but they would join the Israelites in battle until everyone had received their inheritance. Moses agreed, provided they kept their promise. If they did, they could return and possess the land of Gilead. If not, they would be sinning against the Lord.

The Reubenites and Gadites assured Moses they would do as commanded. Moses then instructed Eleazar, Joshua, and the tribal leaders to give them the land of Gilead if they fulfilled their promise. The Reubenites and Gadites built cities and pens for their livestock, while the half-tribe of Manasseh also took possession of parts of Gilead.

The Israelites' journey from Egypt was recorded by Moses as commanded by the Lord. They left Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after Passover, in full view of the Egyptians who were burying their firstborn. The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth, then to Etham, and continued their journey through various locations, including the Red Sea, the wilderness of Sin, and Marah, where they found twelve springs and seventy palm trees.The Israelites continued their journey, moving from Rephidim to the wilderness of Sinai, then to Kibrothhattaavah, Hazeroth, Rithmah, Rimmonparez, Libnah, Rissah, Kehelathah, Mount Shapher, Haradah, Makheloth, Tahath, Tarah, Mithcah, Hashmonah, Moseroth, Benejaakan, Horhagidgad, Jotbathah, Ebronah, Eziongaber, the wilderness of Zin (Kadesh), and finally to Mount Hor on the edge of Edom. 

Aaron, the priest, died on Mount Hor at the age of 123, in the fortieth year after the Israelites left Egypt. King Arad of Canaan heard of the Israelites' approach. The Israelites then moved from Mount Hor to Zalmonah, Punon, Oboth, Ijeabarim (on the border of Moab), Iim, Dibongad, Almondiblathaim, the mountains of Abarim (before Nebo), and finally to the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho.

The Lord instructed Moses to tell the Israelites that when they crossed the Jordan into Canaan, they must drive out all the inhabitants, destroy their idols and places of worship, and take possession of the land. The land was to be divided among the tribes by lot, with larger tribes receiving more land and smaller tribes receiving less. If they failed to drive out the inhabitants, those remaining would become a source of trouble for them.

The Lord also outlined the borders of the land they were to inherit: from the wilderness of Zin along the coast of Edom, to the Salt Sea, up to the ascent of Akrabbim, through Zin to Kadeshbarnea, Hazaraddar, Azmon, the river of Egypt, and the Great Sea. The western border would be the Great Sea, the northern border from the Great Sea to Mount Hor, Hamath, Zedad, Ziphron, and Hazarenan. The eastern border would run from Hazarenan to Shepham, down to Riblah, and along the Sea of Chinnereth to the Jordan River, ending at the Salt Sea.

Moses was to assign Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun to oversee the division of the land, along with one leader from each tribe. The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh had already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan.

The Lord also commanded that the Israelites give the Levites cities to live in, along with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock. Six of these cities were to be designated as cities of refuge, where someone who accidentally killed another person could seek asylum until a fair trial. The total number of cities given to the Levites was to be forty-eight, distributed proportionally among the tribes based on their inheritance.If someone kills another person with a stone or a wooden weapon, they are considered a murderer and must be put to death. The person seeking revenge for the bloodshed has the right to kill the murderer when they encounter them. However, if the killing was accidental and not out of hatred, the community must judge the case. If the killer is found innocent of intentional murder, they must stay in a city of refuge until the high priest dies. If they leave the city and are killed by the avenger, the avenger is not guilty. The killer must remain in the city of refuge until the high priest's death, after which they can return to their land.

These rules are to be followed by all generations. A murderer must be put to death based on the testimony of multiple witnesses; one witness is not enough. No ransom can be accepted for the life of a murderer—they must be executed. Similarly, no ransom can be accepted for someone who fled to a city of refuge; they must stay there until the high priest dies. The land must not be polluted by bloodshed, as it can only be cleansed by the blood of the murderer. The Lord dwells among the Israelites, so they must not defile the land.

The leaders of the families of Gilead, descendants of Manasseh, approached Moses and the leaders of Israel. They were concerned that if the daughters of Zelophehad married men from other tribes, their inheritance would be transferred to those tribes. Moses, following the Lord's command, instructed that the daughters of Zelophehad could marry anyone they chose, but only within their father's tribe. This ensured that each tribe's inheritance remained within the tribe. The daughters of Zelophehad married their cousins, keeping their inheritance within the tribe of Manasseh.

These are the commandments and judgments given by the Lord through Moses to the Israelites in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho.

In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites, recounting all that the Lord had commanded. After defeating Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, Moses began to explain the law. The Lord had told them at Horeb that they had stayed long enough at the mountain and should journey to the land of the Amorites and beyond, to the land promised to their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Moses reminded the people that he could not bear the burden of leading them alone, as they had become numerous. He appointed wise and respected men from each tribe as leaders and judges to help him. These judges were instructed to hear cases fairly, without partiality, and to bring difficult cases to Moses.

The Israelites journeyed from Horeb through the wilderness to Kadeshbarnea, where Moses told them to go up and take possession of the land the Lord had given them. However, the people were afraid and refused to go, despite Moses' assurances that the Lord would fight for them as He had in Egypt. They doubted the Lord's promise and complained that He had brought them out of Egypt to be destroyed by the Amorites.The Lord guided you with a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day to show you the way. When the Lord heard your complaints, He was angry and swore that none of the evil generation would see the promised land, except Caleb, who followed the Lord completely. The Lord was also angry with me because of you and said I would not enter the land either. Instead, Joshua, who stands before you, will lead you into the land. Encourage him, for he will help Israel inherit it. Your children, whom you thought would be prey, will enter and possess the land. But as for you, turn back and journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.

You then admitted your sin against the Lord and prepared to fight as He commanded. But the Lord warned me to tell you not to go up and fight because He was not with you, and you would be defeated. You ignored this and went up the hill anyway, where the Amorites attacked and chased you like bees, defeating you at Seir and Hormah. You returned and wept before the Lord, but He did not listen. So, you stayed in Kadesh for many days.

We then turned and journeyed into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord instructed, and circled Mount Seir for many days. The Lord told me it was time to turn northward and pass through the territory of our relatives, the descendants of Esau in Seir. They would be afraid of us, but we were not to provoke them because their land was not ours to take. We were to buy food and water from them, for the Lord had blessed us in all our work and had been with us for forty years, ensuring we lacked nothing.

We passed by our relatives, the descendants of Esau in Seir, and continued through the wilderness of Moab. The Lord instructed us not to harass the Moabites or engage them in battle, as their land was given to the descendants of Lot. The Emims, a great and tall people like the Anakims, once lived there, but the Moabites called them Emims. The Horims also lived in Seir before the descendants of Esau took over. The Lord told us to cross the brook Zered, and we did. It took thirty-eight years from Kadeshbarnea until the entire generation of fighting men perished, as the Lord had sworn.

When all the fighting men had died, the Lord told me to pass through Ar, the territory of Moab, and not to harass the Ammonites, as their land was given to the descendants of Lot. The land of the Ammonites was also considered a land of giants, called Zamzummims, who were great and tall like the Anakims. The Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites, who took over their land. The same happened with the descendants of Esau in Seir and the Avims in Hazerim, who were replaced by the Caphtorims.

The Lord then instructed us to cross the river Arnon and take possession of the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon. He promised to instill fear and dread of us in all nations under heaven. I sent messengers to Sihon with words of peace, asking to pass through his land, buying food and water as needed. But Sihon refused because the Lord had hardened his spirit to deliver him into our hands. We fought Sihon and his people at Jahaz, and the Lord delivered them to us. We captured all their cities and destroyed everyone, taking only the cattle and spoils for ourselves.

We did not take the land of the Ammonites or any place forbidden by the Lord. We then turned and went up to Bashan, where Og, king of Bashan, came out to fight us at Edrei. The Lord told us not to fear him, for He would deliver Og and his land into our hands. We defeated Og and his people, capturing all his cities, which were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars. We destroyed everyone in the cities but took the cattle and spoils. We took the land from the two Amorite kings, from the river Arnon to Mount Hermon. The Sidonians called Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites called it Shenir. We gave the land to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.The Lord your God has given you this land to possess. All your warriors must cross over armed, ahead of your fellow Israelites. But your wives, children, and livestock (since you have many) will stay in the cities I have given you until the Lord gives rest to your fellow Israelites as He has to you, and they too possess the land the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then you may return to your own land.

I instructed Joshua at that time, saying, "You have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms you are going to. Do not be afraid of them, for the Lord your God will fight for you."

I pleaded with the Lord at that time, saying, "O Lord God, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. What god in heaven or on earth can do the deeds and mighty works you do? Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that fine hill country and Lebanon." But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not listen. The Lord said to me, "That is enough. Do not speak to me anymore about this matter. Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west, north, south, and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan. But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land you will see." So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.

Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and laws I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you. You saw with your own eyes what the Lord did at Baal Peor. The Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor, but all of you who held fast to the Lord your God are still alive today.

See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it. Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people." What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to him? And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?

Only be careful and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them. Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when he said to me, "Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children." You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness. Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice. He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets. At that time the Lord directed me to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.

Be very careful, since you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman, or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air, or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below. And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon, and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven. But as for you, the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.

The Lord was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance. I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan. But you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land. Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord your God has forbidden. For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.

After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time—if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and arousing his anger—I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed. The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the Lord will drive you. There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell. But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the Lord your God and obey him. For the Lord your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath.

Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of? Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived? Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?

You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord is God; besides him, there is no other. From heaven, he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth, he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire. Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength, to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.

Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other. Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the Lord your God gives you for all time.

Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan, to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these cities and save their life. The cities were Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.

This is the law Moses set before the Israelites. These are the stipulations, decrees, and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt. They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon), and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea, below the slopes of Pisgah.

Moses summoned all Israel and said: "Hear, Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them."The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. This covenant wasn't just with our ancestors but with all of us who are alive today. The Lord spoke to you face to face from the fire on the mountain. I stood between the Lord and you at that time to relay His words because you were afraid of the fire and didn't go up the mountain. He said:

"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me. Do not make any idols or images of anything in heaven, on earth, or in the waters. Do not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. I will punish the children for the sins of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but I will show love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name. Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it, you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, donkey, or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest as you do. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore, the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.

Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."

These are the commandments the Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud, and the deep darkness; and He added nothing more. Then He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.

When you heard the voice out of the darkness while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me. You said, "The Lord our God has shown us His glory and His majesty, and we have heard His voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them. But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer. For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived? Go near and listen to all that the Lord our God says. Then tell us whatever the Lord our God tells you. We will listen and obey."

The Lord heard you when you spoke to me, and He said, "I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good. Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever! Go, tell them to return to their tents. But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees, and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess."

So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left. Walk in obedience to all that the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.

These are the commands, decrees, and laws the Lord your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, so that you, your children, and their children after them may fear the Lord your God as long as you live by keeping all His decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life. Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.

Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.

When the Lord your God brings you into the land He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. Fear the Lord your God, serve Him only, and take your oaths in His name. Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and His anger will burn against you, and He will destroy you from the face of the land. Do not put the Lord your God to the test as you did at Massah. Be sure to keep the commands of the Lord your God and the stipulations and decrees He has given you. Do what is right and good in the Lord's sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors, thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the Lord said.

In the future, when your son asks you, "What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees, and laws the Lord our God has commanded you?" tell him: "We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. Before our eyes, the Lord sent signs and wonders—great and terrible—on Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household. But He brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land He promised on oath to our ancestors. The Lord commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the Lord our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today. And if we are careful to obey all this law before the Lord our God, as He has commanded us, that will be our righteousness."

When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out many nations before you—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you—and when the Lord your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy. Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the Lord's anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you. This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their idols in the fire. For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be His people, His treasured possession.

The Lord did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath He swore to your ancestors that He brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord your God is God; He is the faithful God, keeping His covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments. But those who hate Him, He will repay to their face by destruction; He will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate Him. Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees, and laws I give you today."Follow these rules and laws carefully, as the Lord your God has commanded. If you do, He will keep His promise to your ancestors, showing you love, blessing you, and making you prosper. He will bless your children, your crops, your livestock, and everything you own. You will be more blessed than any other people, with no one among you or your animals being barren. The Lord will protect you from sickness and will place the diseases of Egypt on your enemies instead.

Destroy all the people the Lord delivers to you without pity, and do not worship their gods, as that will trap you. If you think these nations are too strong to defeat, remember what the Lord did to Pharaoh and Egypt. He will do the same to these nations, sending hornets to drive them out. Do not fear them, for the Lord your God is with you, a powerful and awesome God. He will gradually drive out these nations to prevent wild animals from becoming too numerous. The Lord will deliver their kings into your hands, and you will destroy their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you.

Burn the images of their gods and do not desire the silver or gold on them, as it is detestable to the Lord. Do not bring any detestable thing into your house, or you will be cursed like it. Detest and abhor it, for it is cursed.

Follow all the commandments I give you today so that you may live, multiply, and possess the land the Lord promised to your ancestors. Remember how the Lord led you through the wilderness for forty years to humble and test you, to know what was in your heart. He humbled you by letting you hunger and then feeding you with manna, teaching you that man does not live by bread alone but by every word from the Lord. Your clothes did not wear out, and your feet did not swell during those forty years. Know in your heart that the Lord disciplines you as a father disciplines his son. Keep His commandments, walk in His ways, and fear Him.

The Lord is bringing you into a good land with streams, springs, and fertile valleys. It is a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil, and honey. You will lack nothing and have abundant resources. When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord for the good land He has given you. Be careful not to forget the Lord by failing to keep His commandments, judgments, and statutes. When you are prosperous, do not let your heart become proud and forget the Lord who brought you out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and provided for you. Remember that it is the Lord who gives you the ability to produce wealth, confirming His covenant with your ancestors.

If you forget the Lord and follow other gods, you will surely perish like the nations the Lord is destroying before you. Listen, Israel: You are crossing the Jordan to possess nations greater and stronger than you, with large fortified cities. The Lord will go before you as a consuming fire, destroying them quickly. Do not think it is because of your righteousness that the Lord is giving you this land; it is because of the wickedness of these nations. The Lord is fulfilling His promise to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Understand that it is not because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people.

Remember how you provoked the Lord to anger in the wilderness, from the day you left Egypt until you reached this place. At Horeb, you made the Lord so angry that He wanted to destroy you. When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets of the covenant, I stayed there forty days and nights without eating or drinking. The Lord gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by His finger, containing all the words He spoke to you from the fire on the mountain. After forty days and nights, the Lord gave me the tablets and told me to go down quickly because the people had corrupted themselves by making an idol. The Lord called them a stiff-necked people and wanted to destroy them, but I prayed for them, and the Lord listened.

I came down from the mountain with the two tablets, saw the sin you committed, and broke the tablets before your eyes. I then lay prostrate before the Lord for another forty days and nights, without eating or drinking, because of your sin. I prayed for Aaron, whom the Lord was also angry with, and took the calf you made, burned it, ground it to dust, and threw the dust into the brook. You provoked the Lord at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth Hattaavah. When the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea to possess the land, you rebelled and did not trust or obey Him. You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day I knew you."I prayed to the Lord for forty days and nights, asking Him not to destroy His people, whom He had saved from Egypt with His great power. I reminded Him of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and asked Him not to look at the stubbornness and sins of the people. I feared that other nations would think the Lord couldn't bring us into the promised land and had brought us out to kill us in the wilderness. 

The Lord then told me to carve two stone tablets like the first ones and come up the mountain. He would write the same words on these tablets, and I was to place them in a wooden ark. I did as He commanded, and He wrote the Ten Commandments on the new tablets. I came down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark.

The Israelites traveled from Beeroth to Mosera, where Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar took over as priest. They continued their journey to Gudgodah and then to Jotbath, a land with streams of water. At that time, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant, to serve Him, and to bless in His name. The Levites have no inheritance among their brothers; the Lord is their inheritance.

I stayed on the mountain for another forty days and nights, and the Lord listened to me again and did not destroy the people. He told me to lead the people to possess the land He promised to their ancestors.

Now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you? To fear Him, walk in His ways, love Him, and serve Him with all your heart and soul. Keep His commandments for your own good. The heavens and the earth belong to the Lord, yet He chose your ancestors and their descendants above all people. Therefore, do not be stubborn. The Lord your God is the greatest, showing no partiality and accepting no bribes. He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow and loves the foreigner, providing them with food and clothing. So, love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt. Fear the Lord your God, serve Him, hold fast to Him, and take your oaths in His name. He is your praise and your God, who has done great and awesome things for you. Your ancestors went down to Egypt with seventy people, and now the Lord has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.

Love the Lord your God and keep His commandments always. Remember the great things He has done, including the miracles in Egypt and the wilderness. Keep His commandments so you may be strong and possess the land He promised to your ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey. The land you are entering is not like Egypt, where you had to irrigate your fields. It is a land of hills and valleys that drinks rain from heaven, a land the Lord cares for. If you obey His commands, He will send rain in its season, and you will gather your grain, wine, and oil. He will provide grass for your cattle, and you will have plenty to eat. Be careful not to be deceived and turn to other gods, or the Lord's anger will burn against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain, and the ground will yield no produce.

Fix these words in your hearts and minds, tie them as symbols on your hands, and bind them on your foreheads. Teach them to your children, talking about them at home and on the road, when you lie down and get up. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates, so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors.

If you carefully observe all these commands, love the Lord your God, walk in His ways, and hold fast to Him, He will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you. Every place where you set your foot will be yours. No one will be able to stand against you, for the Lord your God will put the fear and dread of you on all the land you set foot on.

Today, I set before you a blessing and a curse: a blessing if you obey the commands of the Lord your God, and a curse if you disobey and turn to other gods. When the Lord brings you into the land, proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. These mountains are across the Jordan, westward, near the Canaanites. You are about to cross the Jordan to possess the land the Lord your God is giving you. Be sure to obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.

These are the decrees and laws you must follow in the land the Lord your God is giving you. Destroy all the places where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods, whether on high mountains, hills, or under spreading trees. Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, burn their Asherah poles, and cut down the idols of their gods, wiping out their names from those places. Do not worship the Lord your God in the same way. Seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put His name there for His dwelling.Bring your offerings, vows, and freewill gifts, along with the firstborn of your herds and flocks, to the place the Lord chooses. There, you and your households will eat and rejoice in all the blessings the Lord has given you. Don't do as we do here today, where everyone does as they see fit. You haven't yet reached the resting place and inheritance the Lord is giving you. 

When you cross the Jordan and settle in the land the Lord is giving you, and He grants you rest from your enemies, then bring all your offerings to the place He chooses for His name to dwell. Rejoice there with your families and the Levites, who have no inheritance of their own. Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings anywhere you like, but only at the place the Lord chooses. 

You may slaughter and eat meat within your towns whenever you desire, as the Lord has blessed you. Both the ceremonially clean and unclean may eat it, just as you would eat gazelle or deer. However, do not consume the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. 

You must not eat the tithe of your grain, new wine, or oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or any of your vowed offerings, or freewill offerings, or special gifts within your towns. Instead, eat them in the presence of the Lord at the place He chooses, along with your family and the Levites. Rejoice in all you do, and do not neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.

When the Lord enlarges your territory, and you desire to eat meat, you may do so as you wish. If the place the Lord chooses is too far, you may slaughter animals from your herds and flocks as He has commanded and eat them in your towns. Both the clean and unclean may eat it, just as you would eat gazelle or deer. But be sure not to consume the blood, for the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat. Pour it out on the ground like water. Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, for doing what is right in the Lord's eyes.

Take your holy offerings and vows to the place the Lord chooses. Offer your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord, and pour out the blood beside the altar. Eat the meat. Be careful to obey all these commands so that it may go well with you and your children forever, for doing what is good and right in the Lord's eyes.

When the Lord cuts off the nations before you and you take their land, be careful not to be ensnared by their ways. Do not inquire about their gods, asking how they worship, and do not imitate them. The Lord detests their practices, including burning their sons and daughters in the fire. Follow only what the Lord commands you; do not add or take away from it.

If a prophet or dreamer arises and performs a sign or wonder, and then says, "Let's follow other gods," do not listen. The Lord is testing you to see if you love Him with all your heart and soul. Follow the Lord, fear Him, keep His commands, obey His voice, serve Him, and hold fast to Him. That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt. Purge the evil from among you.

If your brother, son, daughter, wife, or closest friend secretly entices you to worship other gods, do not yield or listen. Show no pity or concealment; you must kill them. Your hand must be the first to put them to death, followed by the hands of all the people. Stone them to death for trying to turn you away from the Lord. All Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one will do such wickedness again.

If you hear that wicked men have led a city astray to worship other gods, investigate thoroughly. If it is true, destroy the city and all its inhabitants and livestock with the sword. Gather all the plunder in the public square and burn the city and everything in it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. It must remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder, so the Lord may turn from His fierce anger and show you mercy, compassion, and increase your numbers, as He promised your ancestors. Obey the Lord's commands, doing what is right in His eyes.

You are the children of the Lord. Do not cut yourselves or shave your foreheads for the dead, for you are a holy people chosen by the Lord to be His treasured possession. Do not eat anything detestable. You may eat ox, sheep, goat, deer, gazelle, roe deer, wild goat, ibex, antelope, and mountain sheep. You may eat any animal that has a split hoof and chews the cud. However, do not eat camels, rabbits, or coneys, as they chew the cud but do not have a split hoof; they are unclean. Do not eat pigs, as they have a split hoof but do not chew the cud; they are unclean. Do not eat their meat or touch their carcasses. 

You may eat any fish with fins and scales, but do not eat those without fins and scales; they are unclean. You may eat any clean bird, but do not eat eagles, vultures, kites, ravens, owls, hawks, and other unclean birds. Do not eat any flying insects that are unclean. You may eat any clean bird.You must not eat anything that dies naturally. Instead, give it to a foreigner living in your town, or sell it to a foreigner. Remember, you are a holy people to the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.

Set aside a tenth of all your produce each year. Eat it in the presence of the Lord at the place He chooses, so you may learn to revere Him always. If the place is too far and you can't carry your tithe, convert it to money and take it to the place the Lord chooses. Use the money to buy whatever you desire—cattle, sheep, wine, or other drinks—and enjoy it there with your household. Don't forget the Levites in your town, as they have no inheritance of their own.

Every three years, bring all the tithes of that year's produce and store them in your towns. This will provide for the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows, so they may eat and be satisfied. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all the work of your hands.

At the end of every seven years, cancel debts. This is how it is to be done: every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They must not demand payment from anyone among their own people, because the Lord's time for canceling debts has been proclaimed. You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. There should be no poor among you, for the Lord will bless you in the land He is giving you to possess as your inheritance, if only you fully obey Him and carefully follow all His commands.

The Lord will bless you as He promised, and you will lend to many nations but borrow from none. You will rule over many nations, but none will rule over you. If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the Lord is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: "The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near," so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the Lord against you, and you will be found guilty of sin. Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this, the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to. There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore, I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land.

If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve you for six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today. But if your servant says to you, "I do not want to leave you," because they love you and your family and are well off with you, then take an awl and push it through their earlobe into the door, and they will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant.

Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.

Set apart for the Lord your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep. Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place He will choose. If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God. You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer. But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.

Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, because in the month of Abib He brought you out of Egypt by night. Sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord your God an animal from your flock or herd at the place the Lord will choose as a dwelling for His Name. Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt. Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning.

You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the Lord your God gives you except in the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary of your departure from Egypt. Roast it and eat it at the place the Lord your God will choose. Then in the morning return to your tents. For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the Lord your God and do no work.

Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain. Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the Lord your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the Lord your God has given you. Rejoice before the Lord your God at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites in your towns, and the foreigners, the fatherless, and the widows living among you. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees.

Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress. Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless, and the widows who live in your towns. For seven days celebrate the festival to the Lord your God at the place the Lord will choose. For the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete.

Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the Lord empty-handed: each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed you.

Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly. Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent. Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the Lord your God is giving you.

Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the Lord your God, and do not erect a sacred stone, for these the Lord your God hates.

Do not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect or flaw in it, for that would be detestable to Him. If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the Lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God in violation of His covenant, and contrary to My command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky, and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel...If you hear about someone committing a terrible act in Israel, investigate it thoroughly. If it's true, bring the guilty man or woman to the city gates and stone them to death. A person can only be sentenced to death if there are two or three witnesses; one witness is not enough. The witnesses must be the first to throw stones, followed by the rest of the people, to remove the evil from among you.

If a legal case is too difficult to decide, go to the place the Lord chooses and consult the priests and judges. Follow their decision exactly. Anyone who disobeys the priest or judge must be put to death to eliminate the evil from Israel. This will make the people hear and fear, preventing further disobedience.

When you enter the land God gives you and decide to appoint a king, choose one God selects from among your fellow Israelites. The king must not acquire many horses, return the people to Egypt, or accumulate excessive wealth. He must write a copy of the law, read it daily, and follow it to remain humble and obedient, ensuring a long reign for him and his descendants.

The Levite priests will have no inheritance in Israel; they will live off the offerings made to God. They are entitled to a portion of the sacrifices and the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, and wool. If a Levite moves to the place God chooses, he can serve there like other Levites and share in the offerings.

When you enter the land God gives you, do not adopt the detestable practices of the nations there. Do not sacrifice your children, practice divination, sorcery, witchcraft, or consult the dead. These practices are detestable to God and the reason He drives out those nations. Be blameless before God.

God will raise a prophet from among you, like Moses, to whom you must listen. This prophet will speak God's words, and anyone who does not listen will be held accountable. A false prophet who speaks without God's command or in the name of other gods must be put to death. You can identify a false prophet if their predictions do not come true.

When God gives you the land and you settle in it, designate three cities as places of refuge for anyone who accidentally kills someone. This will protect them from revenge until they can stand trial. If God expands your territory, add three more cities to prevent innocent bloodshed. However, if someone kills out of hatred and flees to a refuge city, the elders must hand them over to the avenger of blood.

Do not move your neighbor's boundary markers set by previous generations. A single witness is not enough to convict someone of a crime; there must be two or three witnesses. If a false witness accuses someone, both parties must stand before the priests and judges. If the witness is proven false, they will receive the punishment they intended for the accused. This will deter others from committing such evil.

When you go to war and see a larger enemy force, do not be afraid because God is with you.When you are about to go into battle, the priest will address the people, saying, "Listen, Israel, today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not lose heart or be afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them. For the Lord your God is with you to fight for you and save you."

The officers will then speak to the people, asking if anyone has built a new house but not yet dedicated it, planted a vineyard but not yet enjoyed its fruit, or become engaged but not yet married. These individuals should return home to avoid dying in battle and having someone else take their place. Additionally, anyone who is afraid or fainthearted should also return home to prevent demoralizing others.

Once the officers have finished speaking, they will appoint commanders to lead the troops.

When you approach a city to attack it, first offer peace. If the city accepts and opens its gates, its people will become your subjects and serve you. If they refuse and choose to fight, lay siege to the city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hands, kill all the men, but take the women, children, livestock, and everything else as plunder. This is how you should treat cities far from you that do not belong to nearby nations.

For the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave anything alive. Completely destroy the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, as the Lord has commanded, to prevent them from teaching you their detestable practices and leading you to sin against the Lord.

When you lay siege to a city for a long time, do not destroy its trees by cutting them down with an axe, as you can eat their fruit. Only cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees to build siege works until the city falls.

If someone is found murdered in the land the Lord your God is giving you, and the killer is unknown, the elders and judges must measure the distance to the surrounding cities. The elders of the nearest city will take a heifer that has never been worked or yoked, bring it to a valley with running water, and break its neck there. The priests, the sons of Levi, will come forward, as they are chosen by the Lord to minister and pronounce blessings. The elders will wash their hands over the heifer and declare their innocence, asking the Lord to forgive His people and not hold them accountable for the innocent blood. This will absolve the community of guilt.

When you go to war and take captives, if you see a beautiful woman among them and want her as your wife, bring her to your home. She must shave her head, trim her nails, and change her clothes. She will mourn her parents for a month, after which you may marry her. If you are not pleased with her, let her go free; do not sell her or treat her as a slave.

If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both bear him sons, he must acknowledge the firstborn son of the unloved wife by giving him a double portion of his inheritance. The firstborn has the right of the firstborn, regardless of the father's feelings.

If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his parents even after discipline, the parents must bring him to the city elders and declare his disobedience. The men of the city will stone him to death to remove the evil from among you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid.

If someone is guilty of a capital offense and is executed by hanging on a tree, do not leave the body hanging overnight. Bury it the same day, as anyone hung on a tree is under God's curse. This will prevent defiling the land the Lord your God is giving you.

If you see your brother's ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it. Return it to your brother. If your brother is not nearby or you do not know who owns it, take it home and keep it until your brother comes looking for it. Do the same with any lost item you find. Do not ignore it.

If you see your brother's donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. Help him get it back on its feet.

A woman must not wear men's clothing, and a man must not wear women's clothing, for this is detestable to the Lord your God.

If you find a bird's nest with chicks or eggs, do not take the mother with the young. Let the mother go and take only the young, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life.

When you build a new house, make a parapet for your roof to prevent anyone from falling off and bringing bloodshed on your house.

Do not plant two kinds of seeds in your vineyard, or the entire crop will be defiled. Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together. Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.

If a man marries a woman, has relations with her, and then dislikes her, falsely accusing her of not being a virgin, the woman's parents must bring proof of her virginity to the city elders. The elders will punish the man, fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give the money to the woman's father. The woman will remain his wife, and he cannot divorce her as long as he lives. If the accusation is true and no proof of the woman's virginity is found, she will be brought to the door of her father's house and stoned to death by the men of her city for dishonoring her father's house. This will remove the evil from among you.If a woman cannot prove her virginity, she will be taken to her father's house and stoned to death by the men of the city for bringing disgrace to her family. This will remove the evil from among you.

If a man is caught sleeping with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death to eliminate the evil from Israel.

If a virgin who is engaged is found sleeping with another man in the city, both must be taken to the city gate and stoned to death. The woman is punished for not crying out for help, and the man for violating another man's wife. This will remove the evil from among you.

If a man rapes an engaged woman in the countryside, only the man must die. The woman is not guilty because she cried for help, but no one was there to save her.

If a man rapes a virgin who is not engaged, he must pay her father fifty shekels of silver and marry her. He cannot divorce her for as long as he lives.

A man must not marry his father's wife or dishonor his father's bed.

A man with damaged genitals or a severed penis cannot enter the assembly of the Lord.

A child born out of wedlock cannot enter the assembly of the Lord, even to the tenth generation.

An Ammonite or Moabite cannot enter the assembly of the Lord, even to the tenth generation, because they did not help you with food and water when you came out of Egypt and hired Balaam to curse you. However, the Lord turned the curse into a blessing because He loves you. Do not seek peace or prosperity for them as long as you live.

Do not despise an Edomite, for he is your brother. Do not despise an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in his land. The children born to them may enter the assembly of the Lord in the third generation.

When you go to war, avoid anything impure. If a man becomes unclean due to a nocturnal emission, he must go outside the camp and stay there until evening. He must wash himself with water, and at sunset, he may return to the camp.

Designate a place outside the camp where you can relieve yourself. Carry a tool to dig a hole and cover your excrement. The Lord your God moves within your camp to protect you and deliver your enemies to you. Therefore, keep your camp holy and free from anything indecent.

Do not return a runaway slave to his master. Let him live among you wherever he chooses and do not oppress him.

There must be no prostitutes among the daughters of Israel or male prostitutes among the sons of Israel. Do not bring the earnings of a prostitute or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God to fulfill any vow, for both are detestable to the Lord.

Do not charge interest on loans to your fellow Israelites, whether money, food, or anything else. You may charge interest to foreigners, but not to your fellow Israelites, so that the Lord your God may bless you in everything you do in the land you are entering to possess.

If you make a vow to the Lord your God, do not delay in fulfilling it, for the Lord your God will demand it from you, and you will be guilty of sin. If you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty. Whatever your lips utter, you must be sure to do, because you made your vow freely to the Lord your God with your own mouth.

When you enter your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket. When you enter your neighbor's grainfield, you may pick kernels with your hands, but do not use a sickle to harvest your neighbor's grain.

If a man marries a woman and later finds something indecent about her, he can write her a certificate of divorce, give it to her, and send her away. If she leaves his house and becomes another man's wife, and the second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, or if he dies, her first husband cannot marry her again after she has been defiled. This would be detestable in the eyes of the Lord. Do not bring sin upon the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.

If a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year, he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.

Do not take a pair of millstones—not even the upper one—as security for a debt, because that would be taking a person's livelihood as security.

If someone is caught kidnapping a fellow Israelite and treating or selling them as a slave, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.

Be careful to follow all the instructions the Levitical priests give you regarding infectious skin diseases. Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam along the way after you came out of Egypt.

When you make a loan to your neighbor, do not go into their house to get what is offered to you as a pledge. Stay outside and let the neighbor bring the pledge out to you. If the neighbor is poor, do not go to sleep with their pledge in your possession. Return their cloak by sunset so that your neighbor may sleep in it and bless you. This will be regarded as a righteous act in the sight of the Lord your God.

Do not take advantage of a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether that worker is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns. Pay them their wages each day before sunset because they are poor and counting on it. Otherwise, they may cry to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin.

Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.

Do not deprive the foreigner or the fatherless of justice, or take the cloak of the widow as a pledge. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you from there. That is why I command you to do this.

When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.

If people have a dispute, they are to take it to court, and the judges will decide the case, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty. If the guilty person deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make them lie down and have them flogged in his presence with the number of lashes the crime deserves, but no more than forty lashes. If the guilty party is flogged more than that, your fellow Israelite will be degraded in your eyes.

Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.

If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband's brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her. The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.If a man refuses to marry his brother's widow, she should go to the city elders and declare his refusal. The elders will then speak to him. If he still refuses, the widow will remove his shoe and spit in his face, declaring that this is what happens to a man who won't uphold his family duty. His family will be known as "The house of the unsandaled."

If two men are fighting and the wife of one intervenes by grabbing the other man's private parts, her hand must be cut off without pity.

Do not use dishonest weights and measures. Always use accurate and fair weights and measures so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you. Dishonest practices are detestable to the Lord.

Remember what the Amalekites did to you on your journey out of Egypt. They attacked those who were lagging behind when you were tired and weary. When the Lord gives you rest from your enemies, you must erase the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget this.

When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, take the first fruits of your harvest, put them in a basket, and go to the place the Lord chooses for His name. Present the basket to the priest and declare that you have come to the land the Lord promised to your ancestors. The priest will place the basket before the altar, and you will recount how your ancestors were oppressed in Egypt and how the Lord delivered them with great signs and wonders. You will then rejoice in all the good things the Lord has given you and your household, along with the Levites and foreigners among you.

In the third year, the year of tithing, give a tenth of your produce to the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows so they may eat and be satisfied. Then declare before the Lord that you have followed His commands and not used the tithe for unclean purposes. Ask the Lord to bless His people and the land He has given you.

The Lord commands you to follow these statutes and judgments with all your heart and soul. You have declared that the Lord is your God and that you will walk in His ways and keep His commands. The Lord has declared that you are His treasured people, and He will set you high above all nations in praise, fame, and honor, making you a holy people to the Lord your God.

Moses and the elders of Israel instructed the people to keep all these commands. When you cross the Jordan River into the land the Lord is giving you, set up large stones and coat them with plaster. Write all the words of this law on them. Build an altar to the Lord your God with uncut stones and offer burnt and peace offerings on it. Rejoice before the Lord your God and write the words of this law clearly on the stones.

Moses and the Levitical priests told all Israel to listen and obey the Lord's commands. When you cross the Jordan, some tribes will stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, and others will stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses. The Levites will declare curses on those who make idols, dishonor their parents, move boundary stones, mislead the blind, deny justice to foreigners, orphans, and widows, commit sexual immorality, or harm their neighbors. The people will affirm each curse by saying "Amen."

If you diligently obey the Lord's commands, He will set you high above all nations and bless you in the city and the field, in your offspring, crops, and livestock. Your basket and kneading trough will be blessed. You will be blessed when you come in and go out. The Lord will defeat your enemies and bless your storehouses and all your undertakings.If you follow the Lord's commandments, He will establish you as His holy people, as He promised. All the nations will see that you are called by the Lord's name and will respect you. The Lord will bless you with prosperity, including abundant offspring, livestock, and crops. He will provide rain in its season and bless all your work. You will lend to many nations but borrow from none. You will be the leader, not the follower, if you obey the Lord's commands and do not turn aside to follow other gods.

However, if you do not obey the Lord's commands, you will face many curses. You will be cursed in the city and the field, and your basket and store will be cursed. Your offspring, crops, and livestock will be cursed. You will be cursed when you come in and when you go out. The Lord will send curses, confusion, and rebuke in everything you do until you are destroyed because of your wickedness. He will bring diseases, fever, inflammation, and drought. The sky above will be like bronze, and the ground below like iron. The Lord will turn the rain into dust and powder until you are destroyed.

You will be defeated by your enemies and scattered among all nations. Your carcasses will be food for birds and wild animals. The Lord will afflict you with boils, tumors, scabs, and itching that cannot be cured. You will be driven mad by what you see. You will be oppressed and robbed continually, with no one to save you. You will build a house but not live in it, plant a vineyard but not enjoy its fruit. Your livestock will be taken away, and your children will be given to another people. Foreigners will consume your crops and oppress you.

If you do not serve the Lord with joy and gladness, you will serve your enemies in hunger, thirst, and nakedness. The Lord will bring a distant nation against you, a fierce nation that shows no respect for the old or young. They will consume your livestock and crops until you are destroyed. You will be besieged in your cities, leading to such desperation that you will eat your own children. The most delicate among you will turn against their own family members.

If you do not follow the words of this law, the Lord will bring extraordinary plagues and prolonged diseases upon you. All the diseases of Egypt and other unknown illnesses will afflict you until you are destroyed. You will be left few in number, though you were once as numerous as the stars. The Lord will scatter you among all peoples, and you will serve other gods. You will find no peace or rest, living in constant fear and uncertainty. You will long for morning in the evening and evening in the morning because of the terror in your heart. The Lord will bring you back to Egypt in ships, and there you will try to sell yourselves as slaves, but no one will buy you.You will be taken back to Egypt in ships, a journey I said you would never make again. There, you will try to sell yourselves as slaves to your enemies, but no one will buy you.

These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant made at Horeb. Moses summoned all Israel and said, "You have seen all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh, his officials, and his land. You witnessed the great trials, signs, and wonders. Yet, to this day, the Lord has not given you a mind that understands, eyes that see, or ears that hear. For forty years, I led you through the wilderness; your clothes and sandals did not wear out. You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink, so you would know that I am the Lord your God.

When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight us, but we defeated them. We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Therefore, keep the words of this covenant and follow them, so you may prosper in everything you do.

Today, all of you stand before the Lord your God—your leaders, elders, officials, all the men of Israel, your children, wives, and the foreigners in your camps who chop your wood and draw your water. You are here to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God, a covenant the Lord is making with you today. He wants to establish you as His people and be your God, as He promised your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This covenant is not only with you who are here today but also with those who are not here.

You know how we lived in Egypt and passed through other nations. You saw their detestable images and idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold. Make sure there is no man, woman, family, or tribe among you whose heart turns away from the Lord to worship other gods. Such a person would be like a root producing bitter poison. When they hear the words of this curse, they may bless themselves and think they will be safe, even though they persist in their own way. This will bring disaster on the well-watered land as well as the dry.

The Lord will not be willing to forgive them; His anger and jealousy will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will fall on them, and the Lord will blot out their names from under heaven. He will single them out for disaster according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law.

Future generations and foreigners from distant lands will see the plagues and diseases the Lord has inflicted on the land. The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur, unfit for planting, like the destruction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord overthrew in fierce anger. All nations will ask, 'Why has the Lord done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?' The answer will be: 'It is because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, which He made with them when He brought them out of Egypt. They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods He had not given them. Therefore, the Lord's anger burned against this land, bringing on it all the curses written in this book. In His furious anger and great wrath, the Lord uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.'

The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the revealed things belong to us and our children forever, so we may follow all the words of this law.

When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations, and when you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to everything I command you today, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you. He will gather you again from all the nations where He scattered you. Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back. He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors. The Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so you may love Him with all your heart and soul and live.

The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you. You will again obey the Lord and follow all His commands I am giving you today. Then the Lord your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock, and the crops of your land. The Lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as He delighted in your ancestors, if you obey the Lord your God and keep His commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul.

Now, what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not up in heaven, so you have to ask, 'Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?' Nor is it beyond the sea, so you have to ask, 'Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?' No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.

See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction. For I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to Him, and to keep His commands, decrees, and laws; then you will live and increase, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.

This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to His voice, and hold fast to Him. For the Lord is your life, and He will give you many years in the land He swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel: "I am now 120 years old and am no longer able to lead you. The Lord has told me, 'You shall not cross the Jordan.' The Lord your God Himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the Lord said. And the Lord will do to them what He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom He destroyed along with their land. The Lord will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you."

Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to their ancestors to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance. The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."

So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel. Then Moses commanded them: "At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing. Assemble the people—men, women, and children, and the foreigners residing in your towns—so they can listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.""Gather everyone—men, women, children, and foreigners living in your towns—so they can listen, learn, and respect the Lord your God, and follow all the words of this law. This way, even the children who don't know anything yet will hear and learn to respect the Lord your God for as long as you live in the land you're about to enter and possess.

The Lord told Moses, 'Your time to die is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting so I can give him his instructions.' Moses and Joshua went to the tent of meeting, and the Lord appeared in a pillar of cloud, which stood at the entrance of the tent. The Lord said to Moses, 'You are about to rest with your ancestors, and these people will soon turn to other gods and break the covenant I made with them. My anger will burn against them, and I will abandon them, hiding my face from them. They will be destroyed, and many disasters will come upon them. Then they will say, "These disasters have come because our God is not with us." I will hide my face because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.

Now, write down this song and teach it to the Israelites. Have them sing it so it will be a witness for me against them. When I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I promised to their ancestors, and they eat their fill and prosper, they will turn to other gods and reject me, breaking my covenant. When many disasters and troubles come upon them, this song will testify against them, for it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are inclined to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them.' So Moses wrote down the song that day and taught it to the Israelites.

Then Moses gave Joshua son of Nun this charge: 'Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them, and I will be with you.' When Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book, he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord: 'Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. It will remain there as a witness against you. For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the Lord while I am still alive, how much more will you rebel after I die! Assemble all the elders of your tribes and your officials so I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them. For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and turn from the way I have commanded you. In the days to come, disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and provoke him to anger with the work of your hands.'

Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:

'Listen, heavens, and I will speak; hear, earth, the words of my mouth. My teaching will fall like rain, my words will descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants. I will proclaim the name of the Lord. Oh, praise the greatness of our God! He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he. They are corrupt and not his children; to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation. Is this the way you repay the Lord, you foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you? Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you. When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel. For the Lord's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance. In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye, like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them aloft. The Lord alone led him; no foreign god was with him. He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag, with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape.

Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled with food, they became heavy and sleek. They abandoned the God who made them and rejected the Rock their Savior. They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols. They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God—gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your ancestors did not fear. You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth. The Lord saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters. "I will hide my face from them," he said, "and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful. They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding. For a fire will be kindled by my wrath, one that burns down to the realm of the dead below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains. I will heap calamities on them and spend my arrows against them. I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust. In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. The young men and young women will perish, the infants and those with gray hair. I said I would scatter them and erase their name from human memory, but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the Lord has not done all this.' They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them. If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be! How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the Lord had given them up? For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede. Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness. Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras. Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults? It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them." The Lord will vindicate his people and relent concerning his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free. He will say: "Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in, the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up to help you! Let them give you shelter! See now that I myself am he! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand. I lift my hand to heaven and solemnly swear: As surely as I live forever, when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me. I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders." Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people.'

Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people. When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel, he said to them, 'Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law. They are not just idle words for you—they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.'"Moses went up to Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab, across from Jericho. There, God showed him the land of Canaan, which He promised to the Israelites. God told Moses that he would die on the mountain and join his ancestors, just as Aaron did on Mount Hor, because Moses had disobeyed God at the waters of Meribah. Although Moses could see the Promised Land, he would not enter it.

Before his death, Moses blessed the Israelites. He spoke of God's appearance from Sinai and His love for the people. Moses reminded them of the laws and blessings given to them. He blessed each tribe individually, wishing them prosperity, safety, and strength.

Moses then climbed Mount Nebo, saw the Promised Land, and died there at 120 years old. The Israelites mourned him for 30 days. Joshua, filled with wisdom from Moses, took over leadership. There was no prophet like Moses, who knew God face to face and performed great wonders in Egypt.

After Moses' death, God spoke to Joshua, instructing him to lead the people across the Jordan River into the Promised Land. God promised to be with Joshua as He was with Moses, urging him to be strong and courageous. Joshua commanded the people to prepare to cross the Jordan in three days. He reminded the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh of their commitment to help their fellow Israelites until everyone had rest and possession of the land. The people pledged their obedience to Joshua, just as they had to Moses, and prepared to follow his lead.Joshua sent two spies to secretly scout the land, especially Jericho. They stayed at the house of a woman named Rahab. The king of Jericho heard about the spies and sent a message to Rahab, demanding she hand them over. Rahab hid the men and told the king's messengers that the spies had already left. She then helped the spies escape by letting them down through a window with a rope, as her house was part of the city wall.

Rahab told the spies that everyone in Jericho was terrified because they had heard about the miracles God performed for the Israelites, like parting the Red Sea and defeating the Amorite kings. She asked the spies to promise to spare her and her family when they conquered the city. The spies agreed, instructing her to tie a scarlet cord in her window as a sign and to gather her family inside her house for safety.

The spies hid in the mountains for three days until it was safe to return to Joshua. They reported that the people of the land were indeed afraid, confirming that God had given them the land.

Early the next morning, Joshua and the Israelites moved from Shittim to the Jordan River, where they camped before crossing. After three days, the officers instructed the people to follow the Ark of the Covenant, carried by the Levite priests, but to keep a distance of about 2,000 cubits. Joshua told the people to sanctify themselves because God would perform wonders among them the next day.

Joshua commanded the priests to carry the Ark and stand in the Jordan River. As soon as the priests' feet touched the water, the river stopped flowing, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. Joshua then instructed twelve men, one from each tribe, to take twelve stones from the riverbed and set them up as a memorial. This was to remind future generations of how God stopped the Jordan River for them to cross.

The priests stood in the middle of the river until everyone had crossed. Once they were on the other side, the priests carrying the Ark also crossed, and the river returned to its normal flow. The Israelites set up camp at Gilgal, where Joshua placed the twelve stones as a lasting memorial.Joshua set up the twelve stones taken from the Jordan River at Gilgal. He told the Israelites that when their children asked about the stones in the future, they should explain that Israel crossed the Jordan on dry land because God stopped the river's flow, just as He did with the Red Sea. This was to show God's power and to ensure that people would always respect Him.

When the Amorite and Canaanite kings heard that God had dried up the Jordan River for the Israelites, they were terrified and lost their courage. At that time, God instructed Joshua to circumcise the Israelites again because the men who had left Egypt had died in the wilderness, and those born during the journey had not been circumcised. Joshua obeyed, and the people stayed in the camp until they healed. God then told Joshua that He had removed the disgrace of Egypt from them, and the place was named Gilgal.

The Israelites celebrated Passover at Gilgal and ate the produce of the land. The manna, which had sustained them in the wilderness, stopped the day after they ate the local food. 

Near Jericho, Joshua encountered a man with a drawn sword who identified himself as the commander of the Lord's army. Joshua bowed and asked for instructions. The commander told him to remove his sandals because he was standing on holy ground, and Joshua complied.

Jericho was tightly shut because of the Israelites. God told Joshua that He had given Jericho, its king, and its warriors into his hands. Joshua was instructed to have his army march around the city once a day for six days, with seven priests carrying trumpets in front of the Ark of the Covenant. On the seventh day, they were to march around the city seven times, and the priests would blow the trumpets. When they heard a long blast, the people were to shout, and the city walls would collapse, allowing them to take the city.

Joshua followed these instructions, and on the seventh day, the walls of Jericho fell after the people shouted. They captured the city and destroyed everything in it, except for Rahab and her family, who were spared because she had hidden the spies. The valuable metals were placed in the treasury of the Lord's house. Joshua declared a curse on anyone who would rebuild Jericho, and the Lord was with Joshua, making him famous throughout the land.

However, the Israelites sinned by taking some of the items that were supposed to be destroyed. A man named Achan took some of these items, causing God's anger to burn against Israel. Joshua sent men to scout the city of Ai, and they advised sending only a small force. But the Israelites were defeated, and thirty-six men were killed. Joshua and the elders mourned and questioned why God had brought them across the Jordan only to be defeated.When the Amorite and Canaanite kings heard that God had dried up the Jordan River for the Israelites, they were terrified and lost their courage.

Joshua sent men to scout the city of Ai, and they advised sending only a small force. But the Israelites were defeated, and thirty-six men were killed. Joshua and the elders mourned and questioned why God had brought them across the Jordan only to be defeated.

God responded to Joshua, telling him to get up and stop lying on his face. He explained that Israel had sinned by taking some of the forbidden items, breaking His covenant. Because of this, they could not stand against their enemies. God instructed Joshua to sanctify the people and remove the forbidden items. The next morning, the tribes, families, and households were brought forward, and Achan was identified as the culprit. Achan confessed to taking a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a fifty-shekel gold bar, which he had hidden in his tent.

Joshua sent messengers to retrieve the items, and they were laid out before the Lord. Achan, along with his family and possessions, was taken to the Valley of Achor, where they were stoned and burned. This act turned away God's anger, and the place was named the Valley of Achor.

God then told Joshua not to be afraid and to take the entire army to attack Ai. This time, they were allowed to keep the spoils and livestock. Joshua set an ambush behind the city. When the men of Ai came out to fight, Joshua and his troops pretended to retreat, drawing the men of Ai away from the city. The ambush force then entered the city, set it on fire, and the Israelites turned back to defeat the men of Ai. The city was completely destroyed, and its king was captured and hanged. Joshua built an altar to the Lord on Mount Ebal, as Moses had commanded, and wrote a copy of the law on stones. The Israelites, along with their leaders and priests, stood on either side of the Ark of the Covenant, and Joshua read all the words of the law to them.When the kings of the Amorites and Canaanites heard that God had dried up the Jordan River for the Israelites, they were terrified and lost their courage.

When the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites heard about these events, they united to fight against Joshua and Israel. The people of Gibeon, however, resorted to deception. They pretended to be ambassadors from a distant land, wearing old clothes and carrying moldy bread to make it seem like they had traveled far. They asked Joshua to make a peace treaty with them. The Israelites were suspicious but eventually agreed without consulting God. Three days later, they discovered that the Gibeonites were actually their neighbors. Despite the deception, the Israelites honored the treaty because they had sworn an oath to God. The Gibeonites were spared but were made servants, tasked with cutting wood and drawing water for the Israelites.

When Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, heard about Joshua's victories and the peace treaty with Gibeon, he feared greatly. Gibeon was a significant city with mighty warriors. Adonizedek called on four other Amorite kings to join him in attacking Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent word to Joshua for help. God assured Joshua not to fear, as He had delivered the enemies into his hands. Joshua and his army marched all night from Gilgal and launched a surprise attack. God caused confusion among the Amorite armies, and they were defeated. As they fled, God sent hailstones that killed more of them than the Israelites did with the sword. Joshua prayed for the sun and moon to stand still, and they did, allowing the Israelites to complete their victory. This event was unique, as God listened to a man's request and fought for Israel.

The five Amorite kings hid in a cave at Makkedah. Joshua ordered the cave's entrance to be sealed with large stones and guarded. The Israelites continued to pursue and defeat their enemies. After the battle, Joshua had the kings brought out, and he instructed his commanders to place their feet on the kings' necks as a sign of victory. The kings were then executed and hung on trees until evening. They were later buried in the cave, which was sealed with stones.

Joshua continued his campaign, capturing and destroying several cities, including Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, and Eglon, following the same pattern of total destruction as with Jericho.Joshua and the Israelites continued their conquests, capturing and destroying cities like Hebron, Debir, and others, leaving no survivors as commanded by God. They defeated all the kings and their lands because God fought for Israel. Joshua then returned to the camp at Gilgal.

When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard about these victories, he allied with other kings to fight Israel. They gathered a massive army, but God assured Joshua of victory. Joshua launched a surprise attack, and God delivered the enemies into Israel's hands. They defeated them completely, burning their chariots and hamstringing their horses.

Joshua then turned back and captured Hazor, killing its king and destroying the city. He continued to conquer other cities, following God's commands given through Moses. Joshua took all the land, including the hills, valleys, and plains, and distributed it among the tribes of Israel. The land finally rested from war.

Joshua's victories included defeating 31 kings and their territories. Despite his old age, God reminded Joshua that there was still land to be possessed. Joshua was instructed to divide the remaining land among the tribes of Israel.Moses defeated the remaining giants in Edrei. However, the Israelites did not expel the Geshurites and Maachathites, who still live among them. The tribe of Levi received no land inheritance; their inheritance was the offerings made to God. Moses allocated land to the tribe of Reuben, including cities like Heshbon and Dibon. The tribe of Gad received land including Jazer and Gilead. Half the tribe of Manasseh received land in Bashan. The Levites received no land but were given cities to live in. The land was divided among the tribes as God commanded through Moses. Caleb, from the tribe of Judah, reminded Joshua of God's promise to him. Despite being 85 years old, Caleb claimed the land of Hebron as his inheritance. The tribe of Judah received their land, with specific borders and cities listed. Caleb drove out the Anakim from Hebron and offered his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever captured Kirjathsepher. Othniel, Caleb's brother, captured it and married Achsah. She asked Caleb for additional land with springs, which he granted. The inheritance of the tribe of Judah included various cities and their villages.The land was divided among the tribes as God commanded through Moses.

The Jebusites, inhabitants of Jerusalem, could not be driven out by the children of Judah and lived among them in Jerusalem to this day.

The lot for the children of Joseph extended from the Jordan by Jericho to the wilderness up to Bethel, then to Luz, and along the borders of Archi to Ataroth. It went westward to the coast of Japhleti, Bethhoron, and Gezer, ending at the sea. The children of Joseph, Manasseh, and Ephraim received their inheritance. The border of Ephraim's inheritance included Atarothaddar, Bethhoron, Michmethah, Taanathshiloh, Janohah, Ataroth, Naarath, Jericho, and the Jordan. The border extended from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah, ending at the sea. Ephraim's separate cities were among the inheritance of Manasseh. The Canaanites in Gezer were not driven out and lived among the Ephraimites, serving under tribute.

Manasseh, the firstborn of Joseph, received land for Machir, the father of Gilead, because he was a warrior. The rest of Manasseh's children received land by their families. Zelophehad, a descendant of Manasseh, had no sons but daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They asked for an inheritance among their father's brothers, and it was granted. Manasseh received ten portions of land, including Gilead and Bashan. The border of Manasseh extended from Asher to Michmethah, Shechem, Entappuah, the river Kanah, and the sea. Manasseh's land included cities in Issachar and Asher: Bethshean, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo. The Canaanites in these cities were not driven out but lived among the Israelites, serving under tribute.

The children of Joseph asked Joshua for more land, as they were a great people. Joshua told them to clear the forested land of the Perizzites and giants if Mount Ephraim was too small. They expressed concern about the Canaanites with iron chariots. Joshua assured them they were strong and would drive out the Canaanites.

The whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle. Seven tribes had not yet received their inheritance. Joshua urged them to take possession of the land. He instructed them to send three men from each tribe to survey and describe the land, which would be divided into seven parts. Judah would remain in the south, and Joseph in the north. The Levites had no land inheritance, as their inheritance was the priesthood. Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh had received their inheritance east of the Jordan. The men surveyed the land and returned to Joshua, who cast lots for them at Shiloh, dividing the land according to their divisions.

The lot for the tribe of Benjamin was between Judah and Joseph. Their northern border started at the Jordan, went up to Jericho, through the mountains westward, and ended at the wilderness of Bethaven. The border continued to Luz (Bethel), Atarothadar, and the hill south of Bethhoron, ending at Kirjathbaal (Kirjathjearim). The southern border started at Kirjathjearim, went to the well of waters of Nephtoah, and descended to the end of the mountain before the valley of the son of Hinnom, in the valley of the giants on the north.The southern border of Benjamin's territory started at the Valley of Hinnom, near the Jebusite city (Jerusalem), and extended to Enrogel. From there, it went north to Enshemesh, then to Geliloth, near the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan, son of Reuben. The border continued north of Arabah and down to the plains. It passed along the northern side of Bethhoglah and ended at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan River. This was the southern boundary. The Jordan River marked the eastern boundary. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin, defined by its borders.

The cities of Benjamin included Jericho, Bethhoglah, the Valley of Keziz, Betharabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, Avim, Parah, Ophrah, Chepharhaammonai, Ophni, and Gaba—twelve cities with their villages. Additionally, Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, Zelah, Eleph, Jebus (Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kirjath—fourteen cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin according to their families.

The second lot fell to the tribe of Simeon. Their inheritance was within the territory of Judah because Judah's portion was too large. Simeon's inheritance included Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah, Hazarshual, Balah, Azem, Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, Ziklag, Bethmarcaboth, Hazarsusah, Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen—thirteen cities with their villages. Also, Ain, Remmon, Ether, and Ashan—four cities with their villages, and all the surrounding villages as far as Baalathbeer (Ramah of the south). This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon according to their families.

The third lot fell to the tribe of Zebulun. Their territory extended to Sarid. Their border went west to Maralah, touched Dabbasheth, and reached the brook near Jokneam. From Sarid, it turned eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth Tabor, then went to Daberath and up to Japhia. From there, it continued east to Gittahhepher, Ittahkazin, and extended to Remmonmethoar and Neah. The border circled north to Hannathon and ended in the Valley of Jiphthahel. Included were Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem—twelve cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Zebulun according to their families.

The fifth lot fell to the tribe of Asher. Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, Alammelech, Amad, Misheal, and extended west to Carmel and Shihorlibnath. It turned east to Bethdagon, reached Zebulun and the Valley of Jiphthahel, then north to Bethemek and Neiel, and continued to Cabul on the left. It included Hebron, Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, and extended to Greater Sidon. The border turned to Ramah and the fortified city of Tyre, then to Hosah, ending at the sea. Included were Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob—twenty-two cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Asher according to their families.

The sixth lot fell to the tribe of Naphtali. Their territory extended from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, Adami Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum, ending at the Jordan River. The border turned west to Aznothtabor, continued to Hukkok, and reached Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan River on the east. The fortified cities included Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, Kedesh, Edrei, Enhazor, Iron, Migdalel, Horem, Bethanath, and Bethshemesh—nineteen cities with their villages.

The territory of Dan was too small, so they fought against Leshem, captured it, and settled there, renaming it Dan after their ancestor. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan according to their families.

After dividing the land, the Israelites gave Joshua, son of Nun, the city he requested, Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim. He built and settled in the city. These were the inheritances distributed by Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the leaders of the tribes at Shiloh before the Lord, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. This completed the division of the land.

The Lord instructed Joshua to designate cities of refuge, as commanded through Moses. These cities were for anyone who killed someone unintentionally to flee and find protection from the avenger of blood. The person would present their case to the city elders, who would provide a place to live. They would remain there until they stood trial or until the high priest died. The cities of refuge were Kedesh in Galilee, Shechem in Ephraim, and Hebron in Judah. East of the Jordan, they were Bezer in Reuben, Ramoth in Gad, and Golan in Manasseh. These cities were for all Israelites and foreigners living among them, providing refuge for anyone who killed someone unintentionally.

The heads of the Levite families approached Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of Israel at Shiloh, requesting cities to live in, as commanded by the Lord through Moses. The Israelites gave the Levites cities and surrounding pasturelands from their own inheritances. The Kohathite clans, including the descendants of Aaron, received thirteen cities from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. The rest of the Kohathites received ten cities from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and half of Manasseh. The Gershonites received thirteen cities from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the other half of Manasseh.The descendants of Merari received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. The Israelites allocated these cities to the Levites as the Lord commanded through Moses. From the tribes of Judah and Simeon, they gave the following cities to the descendants of Aaron, who were part of the Kohathite families: Hebron (a city of refuge), Libnah, Jattir, Eshtemoa, Holon, Debir, Ain, Juttah, and Bethshemesh—nine cities in total. From the tribe of Benjamin, they received Gibeon, Geba, Anathoth, and Almon—four cities. In total, the descendants of Aaron received thirteen cities.

The remaining Kohathite families received cities from the tribe of Ephraim: Shechem (a city of refuge), Gezer, Kibzaim, and Bethhoron—four cities. From the tribe of Dan, they received Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Aijalon, and Gathrimmon—four cities. From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they received Tanach and Gathrimmon—two cities. In total, the remaining Kohathite families received ten cities.

The Gershonite families received cities from the other half-tribe of Manasseh: Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge) and Beeshterah—two cities. From the tribe of Issachar, they received Kishon, Dabareh, Jarmuth, and Engannim—four cities. From the tribe of Asher, they received Mishal, Abdon, Helkath, and Rehob—four cities. From the tribe of Naphtali, they received Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge), Hammothdor, and Kartan—three cities. In total, the Gershonites received thirteen cities.

The Merarite families received cities from the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam, Kartah, Dimnah, and Nahalal—four cities. From the tribe of Reuben, they received Bezer, Jahazah, Kedemoth, and Mephaath—four cities. From the tribe of Gad, they received Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge), Mahanaim, Heshbon, and Jazer—four cities. In total, the Merarites received twelve cities.

In total, the Levites received forty-eight cities with their surrounding pasturelands. The Lord fulfilled His promise to give Israel the land, and they settled in it. He gave them peace and delivered their enemies into their hands. Every promise the Lord made to Israel came true.

Joshua then called the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, commending them for obeying Moses and his commands. He blessed them and sent them back to their land with riches and spoils from their enemies. They returned to their land in Gilead, but built a large altar by the Jordan River, which alarmed the rest of Israel. They feared it was an act of rebellion against the Lord. The Israelites sent Phinehas and ten leaders to confront them. The Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh explained that the altar was not for sacrifices, but as a witness between them and future generations that they still worship the Lord. This explanation satisfied the Israelites, and they praised God, avoiding conflict.The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh explained that the altar they built was not for sacrifices but as a symbol to remind future generations that they still worship the Lord. This explanation pleased Phinehas and the leaders of Israel, and they praised God, avoiding conflict.

Joshua, now old, gathered all the leaders of Israel and reminded them of everything the Lord had done for them. He urged them to remain faithful to God's laws and not to associate with the remaining nations or their gods. He warned that if they turned away from God, they would face severe consequences.

Joshua recounted how God had fulfilled all His promises, driving out their enemies and giving them the land. He emphasized the importance of loving and obeying God, warning that if they served other gods, they would be destroyed.

Joshua then gathered all the tribes at Shechem and reminded them of their history, from Abraham to their current state. He urged them to choose whom they would serve, declaring that he and his household would serve the Lord. The people reaffirmed their commitment to serve the Lord, and Joshua made a covenant with them, setting up a stone as a witness to their promise.

After these events, Joshua died at the age of 110 and was buried in his inheritance. Israel continued to serve the Lord throughout Joshua's lifetime and the lifetimes of the elders who outlived him.After Joshua's death, the Israelites asked God who should lead the fight against the Canaanites. God chose the tribe of Judah. Judah invited the tribe of Simeon to join them, and together they defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites, killing 10,000 men in Bezek. They captured and punished Adonibezek, who acknowledged that God repaid him for his own cruelty. Judah also conquered Jerusalem, setting it on fire, and continued to fight and defeat the Canaanites in various regions.

Caleb offered his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever captured Kirjathsepher. Othniel, Caleb's younger brother, succeeded and married Achsah. She requested and received additional land with springs of water from her father.

The Kenites, descendants of Moses' father-in-law, settled with the tribe of Judah. Judah and Simeon continued to conquer Canaanite cities, including Gaza, Askelon, and Ekron. However, they couldn't drive out the inhabitants of the valley due to their iron chariots.

The tribe of Benjamin failed to drive out the Jebusites from Jerusalem, and they lived together. The house of Joseph successfully spied on and captured Bethel, previously known as Luz, with the help of a local man who showed them the city's entrance.

Several tribes, including Manasseh, Ephraim, Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali, failed to completely drive out the Canaanites from their territories, allowing them to live among them and sometimes making them pay tribute.

The Amorites forced the tribe of Dan into the mountains, but the house of Joseph eventually subdued them, making them pay tribute. The boundaries of the Amorites extended from Akrabbim to the rock and beyond.

An angel of the Lord rebuked the Israelites for not obeying God's command to destroy the altars of the land's inhabitants, leading to their future suffering. The people wept and sacrificed to the Lord at Bochim.

After Joshua's death, the Israelites served the Lord during the lifetimes of Joshua and the elders who outlived him. However, a new generation arose that did not know the Lord or His works, leading them to worship other gods and angering the Lord. God allowed their enemies to oppress them, but He raised judges to deliver them. Despite this, the Israelites repeatedly turned away from God after each judge's death, worsening their behavior and provoking God's anger. God decided not to drive out the remaining nations to test Israel's faithfulness.The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. They intermarried with them and began worshiping their gods, forgetting the Lord. This angered God, and He allowed them to be conquered by King Chushanrishathaim of Mesopotamia, whom they served for eight years. When the Israelites cried out to God, He sent Othniel, Caleb's younger brother, to deliver them. Othniel led them to victory, and the land had peace for forty years until his death.

After Othniel's death, the Israelites again did evil, and God allowed King Eglon of Moab to conquer them. They served Eglon for eighteen years until they cried out to God, who sent Ehud, a left-handed man from the tribe of Benjamin, to deliver them. Ehud made a double-edged dagger, hid it under his clothes, and presented a tribute to Eglon. After sending away the tribute bearers, Ehud told Eglon he had a secret message from God. When Eglon stood up, Ehud stabbed him with the dagger, killing him. Ehud escaped, rallied the Israelites, and they defeated the Moabites, bringing peace for eighty years.

After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath killed six hundred Philistines with an ox goad and delivered Israel.

When Ehud died, the Israelites again did evil, and God allowed them to be oppressed by King Jabin of Canaan, whose army was led by Sisera. The Israelites cried out to God, and He raised Deborah, a prophetess, to lead them. Deborah called Barak to gather ten thousand men to fight Sisera. Barak agreed only if Deborah would go with him. Deborah warned that the honor of victory would go to a woman. Barak and his men defeated Sisera's army, but Sisera fled to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. Jael gave him milk, covered him, and then killed him by driving a tent peg through his head while he slept. Israel continued to grow stronger until they destroyed Jabin.

Deborah and Barak sang a song of praise to God for avenging Israel and for the people's willingness to fight. They recounted God's mighty acts and the victory over Sisera, celebrating the peace that followed.From the tribe of Ephraim, leaders rose to fight against Amalek. Benjamin also joined the battle, and from Machir came rulers, while Zebulun provided skilled writers. The leaders of Issachar supported Deborah and Barak, who led the troops into the valley. The tribe of Reuben had deep internal conflicts, questioning their role. Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, and Dan remained with their ships. Asher stayed by the seashore, but Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives on the battlefield.

The kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo but gained no wealth. The stars fought from the heavens against Sisera, and the Kishon River swept them away. The horses' hooves were shattered in the chaos. The angel of the Lord cursed Meroz for not helping in the battle, while Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, was blessed for her bravery. She gave Sisera milk instead of water, then killed him with a tent peg.

Sisera's mother anxiously awaited his return, imagining he was dividing the spoils of war. But all of God's enemies perished, and those who loved Him shone like the sun. The land had peace for forty years.

After this period, the Israelites again did evil, and God allowed them to be oppressed by the Midianites for seven years. The Midianites were so oppressive that the Israelites hid in caves and strongholds. Whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples invaded, destroying the land and leaving no food or livestock.

The Israelites were impoverished and cried out to God for help. God sent a prophet to remind them of their deliverance from Egypt and their disobedience. An angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, who was hiding from the Midianites, and called him a mighty warrior. Gideon questioned why they were suffering if God was with them. The Lord told Gideon to use his strength to save Israel and assured him of His presence.

Gideon asked for a sign and prepared an offering. The angel instructed him to place the offering on a rock, and fire consumed it. Realizing he had seen an angel, Gideon feared for his life, but the Lord assured him of peace. Gideon built an altar named "The Lord is Peace."

That night, God instructed Gideon to destroy his father's altar to Baal and build an altar to the Lord. Gideon obeyed but did it at night out of fear. The townspeople discovered the destroyed altar and demanded Gideon's death. Joash, Gideon's father, defended him, saying Baal should defend himself if he was a god. Gideon was then called Jerubbaal, meaning "Let Baal contend."

The Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples gathered in the Jezreel Valley. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he called for support from the tribes of Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali. Gideon asked God for a sign with a fleece to confirm his mission. God granted the sign, making the fleece wet with dew while the ground remained dry, and then reversing it the next night.

Gideon and his men camped near the Midianites. God told Gideon he had too many men and instructed him to send home those who were afraid. Twenty-two thousand left, leaving ten thousand.Gideon had too many men, so God told him to take them to the water for a test. Those who lapped the water with their tongues like dogs were separated from those who knelt to drink. Only 300 men lapped the water, and God said He would use these 300 to save Israel and defeat the Midianites. The rest were sent home.

That night, God told Gideon to go down to the Midianite camp. If he was afraid, he could take his servant Phurah. Gideon and Phurah went and overheard a man telling a dream about a barley loaf tumbling into the Midianite camp and overturning a tent. The dream was interpreted as Gideon's victory over Midian. Encouraged, Gideon returned to his camp, divided his 300 men into three groups, and gave each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a torch inside.

Gideon instructed his men to follow his lead. When they reached the edge of the Midianite camp, they blew their trumpets, broke the jars, and shouted, "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!" The Midianites panicked, turned on each other, and fled. Gideon called for reinforcements from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh to pursue the Midianites.

The men of Ephraim captured and killed the Midianite princes Oreb and Zeeb. They brought their heads to Gideon. The Ephraimites were upset that they hadn't been called earlier to fight, but Gideon calmed them by praising their achievements.

Gideon and his 300 men, exhausted but still in pursuit, asked the men of Succoth and Penuel for food but were refused. Gideon promised to punish them after defeating Zebah and Zalmunna, the Midianite kings. Gideon captured the kings and punished the men of Succoth and Penuel as promised. He then killed Zebah and Zalmunna for killing his brothers.

The Israelites asked Gideon to rule over them, but he refused, saying the Lord would rule over them. He requested gold earrings from the plunder, which he used to make an ephod. Unfortunately, the ephod became a snare, leading the Israelites into idolatry.

Midian was subdued, and the land had peace for 40 years during Gideon's lifetime. Gideon had many wives and 70 sons. After his death, the Israelites again turned away from God and worshiped Baal. They forgot the Lord and showed no kindness to Gideon's family.Abimelech, one of Gideon's sons, convinced the people of Shechem to support him as their leader by reminding them that he was their relative. They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baalberith, which he used to hire reckless men to follow him. Abimelech then went to his father's house in Ophrah and killed his seventy brothers, except for the youngest, Jotham, who escaped by hiding.

The people of Shechem and the house of Millo gathered and made Abimelech king. When Jotham heard about this, he climbed Mount Gerizim and shouted a parable to the people of Shechem, comparing them to trees seeking a king. The olive tree, fig tree, and vine all refused, but the bramble accepted, warning that if they were sincere in making Abimelech king, they should trust in his protection; otherwise, fire would come from the bramble and consume them.

Jotham reminded them of how Gideon (Jerubbaal) had risked his life to save them from the Midianites, and how they had repaid him by killing his sons and making Abimelech, the son of a servant, their king. He warned that if they had acted in good faith, they should rejoice in Abimelech, but if not, fire would come from Abimelech and the people of Shechem to destroy each other. Jotham then fled to Beer to escape Abimelech.

Abimelech ruled Israel for three years before God sent a spirit of discord between him and the people of Shechem. The people of Shechem began to act treacherously against Abimelech to avenge the murder of Gideon's sons. They set ambushes in the mountains to rob travelers, and Abimelech was informed of their actions.

Gaal, son of Ebed, moved to Shechem and gained the trust of the people. During a festival, Gaal questioned why they should serve Abimelech and suggested they serve the descendants of Hamor, the founder of Shechem, instead. He challenged Abimelech to gather his army and fight.

When Zebul, the city's ruler, heard Gaal's words, he secretly informed Abimelech and advised him to set an ambush. Abimelech and his men laid in wait, and when Gaal went out to the city gate, Abimelech attacked. Gaal and his followers were defeated and driven out of Shechem.

The next day, Abimelech divided his forces into three groups and ambushed the people of Shechem as they went into the fields. He captured the city, killed its inhabitants, and destroyed it, sowing it with salt. The remaining people took refuge in the tower of Shechem, but Abimelech and his men set it on fire, killing about a thousand men and women.

Abimelech then attacked the city of Thebez, where the people also took refuge in a strong tower. As Abimelech approached to set it on fire, a woman dropped a millstone on his head, fatally injuring him. To avoid the disgrace of being killed by a woman, he asked his armor-bearer to kill him, and the young man did so.

With Abimelech dead, the Israelites returned home. Thus, God repaid Abimelech for his wickedness in killing his brothers and brought the curse of Jotham upon the people of Shechem.

After Abimelech, Tola, son of Puah, from the tribe of Issachar, judged Israel for twenty-three years. He was followed by Jair, a Gileadite, who judged Israel for twenty-two years. Jair had thirty sons who rode thirty donkeys and controlled thirty towns in Gilead, known as Havoth Jair. After Jair's death, the Israelites again turned to idolatry, worshiping the gods of various neighboring nations, and abandoned the Lord. This angered God, and He allowed the Philistines and Ammonites to oppress them for eighteen years. The Ammonites even crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim, causing great distress in Israel.The Israelites cried out to the Lord, admitting they had sinned by abandoning Him and worshiping Baal. The Lord reminded them of how He had saved them from various oppressors in the past, but they had turned away from Him. He told them to seek help from the gods they had chosen. The Israelites confessed their sins and pleaded for deliverance, putting away their foreign gods and serving the Lord again. Moved by their misery, the Lord began to help them.

The Ammonites gathered for battle in Gilead, and the Israelites assembled at Mizpeh. The leaders of Gilead asked who would lead them against the Ammonites, promising that person would become their leader.

Jephthah, a mighty warrior from Gilead, was the son of a prostitute. His half-brothers drove him away, denying him any inheritance. Jephthah fled to Tob, where he gathered a group of outcasts. When the Ammonites waged war against Israel, the elders of Gilead sought Jephthah's help, asking him to lead them. Jephthah reminded them of their past mistreatment but agreed to help if they made him their leader. The elders swore an oath before the Lord, and Jephthah became their leader.

Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon, asking why he was attacking Israel. The king claimed Israel had taken his land when they came out of Egypt. Jephthah responded, explaining that Israel had not taken Ammonite land but had been refused passage through Edom and Moab, leading them to fight the Amorites instead. He argued that the Lord had given Israel the land and questioned why the Ammonites had not reclaimed it in the past 300 years. The king of Ammon ignored Jephthah's message.

Empowered by the Spirit of the Lord, Jephthah led Israel to victory over the Ammonites. He had made a vow to the Lord, promising to sacrifice whatever came out of his house to greet him if he returned victorious. Tragically, his only daughter came out to meet him. Jephthah was devastated but felt bound by his vow. His daughter accepted her fate, asking for two months to mourn her virginity with her friends. After two months, she returned, and Jephthah fulfilled his vow. This event led to an annual tradition where Israelite women would lament Jephthah's daughter for four days each year.

The men of Ephraim confronted Jephthah for not involving them in the battle against Ammon. Jephthah explained that he had called for their help, but they did not respond. A conflict ensued, and Jephthah's forces defeated the Ephraimites. Jephthah judged Israel for six years before his death.

After Jephthah, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel for seven years, followed by Elon the Zebulonite, who judged for ten years.Abdon, the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel for eight years. He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys. When Abdon died, he was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.

Once again, the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and He handed them over to the Philistines for forty years. There was a man named Manoah from Zorah, of the Danite tribe, whose wife was unable to have children. An angel of the Lord appeared to her and said, "You are barren, but you will conceive and bear a son. Be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean. Your son will be a Nazirite dedicated to God from birth, and he will begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines."

The woman told her husband about the angel's visit. Manoah prayed to the Lord, asking for the man of God to return and teach them how to raise the child. God listened, and the angel appeared again to Manoah's wife while she was in the field. She quickly fetched her husband, and Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child. The angel repeated the instructions: the woman must avoid wine, strong drink, and unclean food.

Manoah offered to prepare a meal for the angel, but the angel said he would not eat and instructed Manoah to offer a burnt offering to the Lord. Manoah did not realize he was speaking to an angel. When Manoah asked for the angel's name, the angel replied that it was beyond understanding. Manoah then offered a young goat on a rock to the Lord, and as the flame rose from the altar, the angel ascended in the flame. Manoah and his wife fell to the ground in awe, realizing they had seen an angel of the Lord. Manoah feared they would die, but his wife reassured him that the Lord would not have accepted their offering or revealed these things if He intended to kill them.

The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The Lord blessed him, and the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him while he was in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

Samson went to Timnah and saw a Philistine woman he wanted to marry. Despite his parents' objections, he insisted on marrying her because she pleased him. They did not realize this was part of the Lord's plan to confront the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at the time.

On his way to Timnah, Samson encountered a young lion. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands but did not tell his parents. Later, he found a swarm of bees and honey in the lion's carcass, which he ate and shared with his parents without revealing its source.

Samson held a feast in Timnah, as was customary for young men. He proposed a riddle to his thirty companions, promising them thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes if they could solve it within seven days. If they failed, they would owe him the same. The riddle was: "Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet." After three days, they could not solve it.

On the seventh day, they pressured Samson's wife to coax the answer from him, threatening to burn her and her father's house. She wept and pleaded with Samson until he finally revealed the answer, which she then told her people. Before sunset on the seventh day, the men of the city answered Samson's riddle. Enraged, Samson went to Ashkelon, killed thirty men, and took their clothes to pay his debt. In his anger, he returned to his father's house, and his wife was given to his companion.

Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat, intending to go to her room. Her father refused, thinking Samson hated her and had given her to his companion. He offered Samson her younger sister instead. Furious, Samson caught three hundred foxes, tied their tails together in pairs with torches, and set them loose in the Philistines' grain fields, burning the grain, vineyards, and olive groves.

When the Philistines learned that Samson was responsible, they burned his wife and her father to death. Samson vowed revenge and attacked them viciously. He then retreated to a cave in the rock of Etam. The Philistines camped in Judah, prompting the men of Judah to confront Samson. They reminded him that the Philistines ruled over them and asked why he had caused trouble. Samson replied that he had only done to them what they had done to him. The men of Judah agreed to bind Samson and hand him over to the Philistines, but Samson made them swear not to kill him themselves.The men of Judah promised Samson they wouldn't kill him but would hand him over to the Philistines. They tied him up with new ropes and brought him to Lehi. When the Philistines saw him, they shouted in triumph, but the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Samson. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax and fell off. He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, picked it up, and killed a thousand men with it. Afterward, he threw away the jawbone and named the place Ramath Lehi.

Samson was very thirsty and called out to the Lord, saying, "You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?" God opened up a hollow place in Lehi, and water came out. Samson drank, his strength returned, and he revived. He named the place En Hakkore, and it is still called that today. Samson led Israel for twenty years during the time of the Philistines.

One day, Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute. He spent the night with her. The people of Gaza were told, "Samson is here!" They surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet, thinking, "At dawn, we'll kill him." But Samson stayed in bed only until midnight. Then he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate, along with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.

Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek named Delilah. The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver."

So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued." Samson answered her, "If anyone ties me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man." Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him with them. With men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.

Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied." He said, "If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man." So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.

Delilah then said to Samson, "All this time you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied." He replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I'll become as weak as any other man." So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric, and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.

Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength." With such nagging, she prodded him day after day until he was sick to death of it. So he told her everything. "No razor has ever been used on my head," he said, "because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man."

When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, "Come back once more; he has told me everything." So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands. After putting him to sleep on her lap, she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. And his strength left him.

Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out as before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the Lord had left him. The Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes, and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.

The rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, "Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands." When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain." While they were in high spirits, they shouted, "Bring out Samson to entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars, Samson said to the servant who held his hand, "Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them." Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.

Then Samson prayed to the Lord, "Sovereign Lord, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes." Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on one and his left hand on the other, Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.

Then his brothers and his father's whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel for twenty years.

There was a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim. He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which you cursed—I have it. I took it." Then his mother said, "The Lord bless you, my son!" When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you." So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol. And it was put in Micah's house.

Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest. In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit. A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah, left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way, he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim. Micah asked him, "Where are you from?" "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay."

Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes, and your food." So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him. Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house. And Micah said, "Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."

In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. So the Danites sent five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all the Danites. They told them, "Go, explore the land." So they entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night. When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?" He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, "He has hired me, and I am his priest." They said to him, "Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful."The five men asked the priest to pray to God to see if their journey would be successful. The priest told them to go in peace, as the Lord was with them. The men then traveled to Laish and saw that the people there lived carefree, like the Sidonians, without any rulers to shame them. They returned to their brothers in Zorah and Eshtaol and reported that the land was good and urged them to take it. Six hundred armed men from the Danite tribe set out and camped near Kirjathjearim in Judah, naming the place Mahaneh Dan. They then moved to the hill country of Ephraim and reached Micah's house.

The five spies informed their brothers about the religious items in Micah's house, including an ephod and household gods. They decided to take these items. The six hundred armed men stood at the gate while the five spies entered Micah's house and took the religious items. The priest questioned their actions, but they convinced him to join them, offering him a better position as a priest for their tribe. The priest agreed and left with them, taking the religious items.

As they departed, they placed their children, livestock, and possessions in front of them. When they were a distance from Micah's house, Micah and his neighbors caught up with them and demanded to know why they had taken his gods and priest. The Danites warned Micah to stay quiet to avoid violence. Realizing he couldn't overpower them, Micah returned home.

The Danites then attacked the peaceful and secure city of Laish, killing its inhabitants and burning it down. They rebuilt the city and named it Dan, after their ancestor. They set up the religious items they had taken from Micah, and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, and his descendants served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the land's captivity. The religious items remained in use as long as the house of God was in Shiloh.

During this time, there was no king in Israel. A Levite living in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. She was unfaithful and returned to her father's house in Bethlehem. After four months, the Levite went to persuade her to return, bringing his servant and two donkeys. Her father welcomed him and insisted he stay for several days. On the fifth day, the Levite decided to leave despite his father-in-law's urging to stay longer.

As they traveled, they reached Jebus (Jerusalem) near evening. The Levite's servant suggested they stay in the city, but the Levite preferred to continue to Gibeah or Ramah, towns of the Israelites. They arrived in Gibeah, but no one offered them lodging. An old man from Ephraim, living in Gibeah, invited them to stay at his house, providing for their needs.

While they were enjoying themselves, some wicked men from the city surrounded the house, demanding to have sex with the Levite. The old man pleaded with them not to commit such an evil act and offered his daughter and the Levite's concubine instead. The men refused, so the Levite sent his concubine outside. They abused her all night, and she collapsed at the door in the morning. The Levite found her there, unresponsive, and took her home. He then cut her body into twelve pieces and sent them throughout Israel to rally the tribes against the atrocity.The Levite sent pieces of his concubine's body throughout Israel, shocking everyone who saw it. They said nothing like this had ever happened since Israel left Egypt. They urged everyone to consider the matter and speak up.

All the Israelites, from Dan to Beersheba and the land of Gilead, gathered as one before the Lord at Mizpeh. Four hundred thousand armed men presented themselves. The tribe of Benjamin heard about this gathering. The Israelites asked, "How did this wickedness happen?"

The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, explained that he and his concubine had stayed in Gibeah, a town of Benjamin. The men of Gibeah attacked them, intending to kill him and abusing his concubine to death. He then cut her body into pieces and sent them throughout Israel because of the vile act committed.

The Israelites, united, decided not to return home until they had dealt with Gibeah. They planned to draw lots to decide who would attack. They would gather provisions and go to Gibeah to punish the wickedness.

The tribes of Israel sent messengers to Benjamin, demanding they hand over the guilty men of Gibeah for execution to purge the evil. But the Benjamites refused and prepared for battle. They gathered 26,000 men, plus 700 elite left-handed soldiers who could sling stones with great accuracy.

The Israelites, excluding Benjamin, numbered 400,000 warriors. They sought God's guidance on who should lead the attack, and God chose Judah. The Israelites set up camp near Gibeah and prepared for battle.

On the first day, the Benjamites killed 22,000 Israelites. The Israelites encouraged themselves and regrouped. They wept before the Lord and asked if they should continue fighting. God told them to go up against Benjamin again.

On the second day, the Benjamites killed another 18,000 Israelites. The Israelites wept, fasted, and offered sacrifices, seeking God's counsel again. God assured them that He would deliver Benjamin into their hands the next day.

The Israelites set an ambush around Gibeah. On the third day, they drew the Benjamites out of the city and began to retreat, luring them away. The ambush then attacked Gibeah, setting it on fire. Seeing the smoke, the Israelites turned and fought the Benjamites, who realized they were trapped.

The Benjamites tried to flee but were overtaken. The Israelites killed 25,100 Benjamite soldiers. The remaining Benjamites fled to the wilderness but were pursued and killed. Only 600 men escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed for four months.

The Israelites then destroyed the remaining Benjamite cities, killing everyone and burning everything. They had sworn not to give their daughters to the Benjamites as wives. They wept before God, lamenting the loss of a tribe.

The next day, they built an altar and offered sacrifices. They realized no one from Jabesh Gilead had joined the assembly, so they sent 12,000 warriors to kill the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead, sparing only the virgin women.The Israelites gathered 400 young virgins from Jabesh Gilead and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan. The entire congregation sent messengers to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon, offering peace. The Benjamites returned, and the Israelites gave them the women from Jabesh Gilead, but there weren't enough.

The people felt remorse for Benjamin, as the Lord had caused a division among the tribes of Israel. The elders asked how they could provide wives for the remaining Benjamites since the women of Benjamin had been destroyed. They decided that the surviving Benjamites must have an inheritance to prevent the tribe from disappearing.

However, they couldn't give their own daughters as wives because they had sworn not to. They noted that there was an annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, located north of Bethel, east of the highway to Shechem, and south of Lebonah. They instructed the Benjamites to hide in the vineyards and, when the daughters of Shiloh came out to dance, to seize a wife from among them and return to Benjamin.

When the fathers or brothers of the women complained, the Israelites would tell them to be kind for their sake, as they hadn't provided wives during the war and thus weren't guilty. The Benjamites did as instructed, taking wives from the dancers, and returned to rebuild their cities.

The Israelites then returned to their own tribes and families. In those days, Israel had no king, and everyone did what they thought was right.

In the time of the judges, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah, named Elimelech, went to live in Moab with his wife Naomi and their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion. Elimelech died, leaving Naomi with her two sons, who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After about ten years, both sons died, leaving Naomi without her husband and sons.

Naomi decided to return to Judah after hearing that the Lord had provided food for His people. She set out with her daughters-in-law but urged them to return to their mothers' homes, wishing them kindness and new husbands. They wept, and Orpah returned, but Ruth clung to Naomi, insisting on staying with her.

Ruth declared her loyalty to Naomi, saying she would go where Naomi went, live where she lived, and worship Naomi's God. Naomi saw Ruth's determination and stopped urging her to leave. They traveled to Bethlehem, where the whole town was stirred by their arrival. Naomi, feeling bitter, asked to be called Mara, as she felt the Almighty had afflicted her.

Naomi and Ruth arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. Naomi had a wealthy relative named Boaz. Ruth asked Naomi's permission to glean in the fields, and she happened to work in Boaz's field. Boaz noticed her and learned about her loyalty to Naomi. He instructed his workers to protect her and let her gather grain.

Ruth was grateful for Boaz's kindness, and he invited her to eat with his workers. She continued to glean in his field, gathering a substantial amount of barley. Naomi was pleased and blessed Boaz, recognizing him as a close relative. Ruth continued to work in Boaz's fields throughout the harvests, living with Naomi.

Naomi then advised Ruth to seek security with Boaz, who was winnowing barley at the threshing floor. She instructed Ruth to wash, anoint herself, and go to Boaz, uncovering his feet and lying down. Ruth followed Naomi's instructions.Naomi advised Ruth to dress nicely and go to the threshing floor where Boaz was working. She told Ruth to wait until Boaz had finished eating and drinking, then to note where he lay down. Ruth was to uncover his feet and lie down, and Boaz would tell her what to do next. Ruth agreed to follow Naomi's instructions.

Ruth went to the threshing floor and did as Naomi had told her. After Boaz had eaten and was in good spirits, he lay down at the end of a pile of grain. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. Around midnight, Boaz woke up and was startled to find a woman lying at his feet. He asked who she was, and Ruth replied, "I am your servant Ruth. Spread your garment over me, for you are a guardian-redeemer of our family."

Boaz blessed Ruth for her kindness and assured her that he would do everything she asked, as everyone in town knew she was a virtuous woman. However, he mentioned that there was another guardian-redeemer closer in line than he was. Boaz asked Ruth to stay the night and promised to resolve the matter in the morning. If the other guardian-redeemer was willing to redeem her, fine; if not, Boaz would do it.

Ruth stayed at Boaz's feet until morning but left before anyone could recognize her. Boaz gave her six measures of barley to take back to Naomi, saying she shouldn't return empty-handed. When Ruth returned to Naomi, she recounted everything that had happened. Naomi advised Ruth to wait, as Boaz would not rest until he had settled the matter that day.

Boaz went to the town gate and waited for the other guardian-redeemer to pass by. He called him over and gathered ten elders of the town as witnesses. Boaz explained that Naomi was selling a piece of land that belonged to their relative Elimelech. The other guardian-redeemer initially agreed to redeem it, but Boaz added that he would also have to marry Ruth to maintain the family line. The guardian-redeemer declined, fearing it would jeopardize his own estate, and told Boaz to redeem it himself.

To confirm the transaction, the guardian-redeemer removed his sandal and gave it to Boaz, a customary act in Israel. Boaz then declared to the elders and all the people that he had bought all of Elimelech's property and taken Ruth as his wife to preserve the family name. The elders and people blessed Boaz and Ruth, wishing them a prosperous future.

Boaz married Ruth, and the Lord blessed them with a son. The women of the town congratulated Naomi, saying the child would renew her life and sustain her in old age, as Ruth, who loved her, had given birth to him. Naomi took care of the child, and the women named him Obed. Obed became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.

The genealogy from Perez to David is as follows: Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon, Salmon fathered Boaz, Boaz fathered Obed, Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.

In the time of the judges, there was a man named Elkanah from Ramathaim in the hill country of Ephraim. He had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. Every year, Elkanah went to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to the Lord. He gave portions of the sacrifice to Peninnah and her children, but he gave a double portion to Hannah because he loved her, even though the Lord had closed her womb.

Peninnah would provoke Hannah to irritate her, causing Hannah to weep and not eat. Elkanah tried to comfort her, asking why she was sad and if he wasn't better to her than ten sons. After eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah prayed to the Lord in deep anguish, vowing that if He gave her a son, she would dedicate him to the Lord for his entire life.

Eli the priest saw Hannah praying silently and thought she was drunk. He rebuked her, but Hannah explained that she was deeply troubled and was pouring out her soul to the Lord. Eli blessed her, asking God to grant her request. Hannah left, feeling uplifted, and ate something.

The next morning, Elkanah and his family worshipped before the Lord and returned home. The Lord remembered Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to a son, naming him Samuel, saying, "Because I asked the Lord for him."

When it was time for the annual sacrifice, Hannah did not go, telling Elkanah she would wait until Samuel was weaned. Elkanah agreed, and when Samuel was weaned, Hannah took him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh, along with a sacrifice. She presented Samuel to Eli, reminding him that she was the woman who had prayed for this child. She dedicated Samuel to the Lord, and he worshipped there.

Hannah prayed a prayer of thanksgiving, rejoicing in the Lord's deliverance and exalting His power.Hannah prayed, "My heart rejoices in the Lord; my strength is lifted up by Him. There is no one holy like the Lord, no one besides Him, no rock like our God. Stop boasting so proudly, for the Lord is a God who knows, and He judges actions. The mighty warriors' bows are broken, but those who stumbled are now strong. Those who were full now work for food, while the hungry are satisfied. The barren woman has seven children, but the one with many sons is weak. The Lord brings death and gives life; He brings down to the grave and raises up. He makes some poor and others rich; He humbles and exalts. He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the ash heap, seating them with princes and giving them a place of honor. The foundations of the earth belong to the Lord; He has set the world upon them. He guards the steps of His faithful ones, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. It is not by strength that one prevails; those who oppose the Lord will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the Lord will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to His king and exalt the horn of His anointed."

Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy Samuel served the Lord under Eli the priest. Eli's sons were wicked; they did not know the Lord. The custom for the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork while the meat was boiling and would plunge it into the pan, kettle, or pot. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. Even before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the person sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, only raw." If the person said, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force." This sin of the young men was very great in the Lord's sight, for they were treating the Lord's offering with contempt.

But Samuel was ministering before the Lord—a boy wearing a linen ephod. Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the Lord." Then they would go home. The Lord was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord.

Eli was very old, and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the Lord's people is not good. If one person sins against another, God may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the Lord, who will intercede for them?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the Lord's will to put them to death.

And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the Lord and with people. Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the Lord says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor's family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor's family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites. Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?' Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.' But now the Lord declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house so that no one in it will reach old age, and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age. Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day. I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always. Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"

The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli. In those days the word of the Lord was rare; there were not many visions. One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord, where the ark of God was. Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am." And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down. Again the Lord called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him. A third time the Lord called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy. So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place. The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening." And the Lord said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle. At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end. For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God, and he did not restrain them. Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"

Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am." "What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you." So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes."

The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel's words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord. The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word. And Samuel's word came to all Israel.

Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord's covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies." So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. When the ark of the Lord's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp, the Philistines were afraid. "A god has come into the camp," they said. "Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness."The Philistines, recalling the plagues that struck Egypt, urged each other to be brave and fight like men to avoid becoming slaves to the Hebrews. They fought fiercely, and Israel was defeated, losing thirty thousand soldiers. The Ark of God was captured, and Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.

A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefield to Shiloh with torn clothes and dirt on his head, a sign of mourning. Eli, who was 98 years old and nearly blind, was anxiously waiting for news about the Ark. When the man arrived and reported the defeat, the deaths of Eli's sons, and the capture of the Ark, Eli fell backward from his seat, broke his neck, and died. He had judged Israel for forty years.

Phinehas' wife, who was pregnant and near delivery, went into labor upon hearing the news of the Ark's capture and the deaths of her husband and father-in-law. She gave birth to a son and named him Ichabod, meaning "The glory has departed from Israel," because the Ark of God was taken.

The Philistines took the Ark to Ashdod and placed it in the temple of their god Dagon. The next morning, they found Dagon fallen face down before the Ark. They set Dagon back up, but the following morning, Dagon had fallen again, this time with his head and hands broken off. The people of Ashdod were struck with tumors, and they decided to send the Ark to Gath. The same afflictions struck Gath, so they sent the Ark to Ekron. The Ekronites, fearing for their lives, demanded the Ark be sent back to Israel.

The Philistine leaders decided to return the Ark with a guilt offering of five gold tumors and five gold rats, representing the plagues that had struck them. They placed the Ark on a new cart pulled by two cows and sent it towards Beth Shemesh. The cows went straight to Beth Shemesh, where the people rejoiced to see the Ark. They offered sacrifices to the Lord, but some men of Beth Shemesh looked into the Ark and were struck down by God.

The people of Beth Shemesh sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, asking them to take the Ark. The men of Kiriath Jearim brought the Ark to the house of Abinadab and consecrated his son Eleazar to guard it. The Ark remained there for twenty years, and the Israelites mourned and sought the Lord.

Samuel told the Israelites to return to the Lord with all their hearts, put away foreign gods, and serve Him only. They gathered at Mizpah, fasted, and confessed their sins. When the Philistines heard of the gathering, they prepared to attack. The Israelites, fearing the Philistines, asked Samuel to pray for their deliverance.Samuel offered a young lamb as a burnt offering to the Lord and prayed for Israel. As he did, the Philistines approached for battle, but the Lord thundered loudly, causing confusion among them, and they were defeated by the Israelites. The Israelites chased the Philistines and struck them down until they reached Bethcar. Samuel set up a stone between Mizpeh and Shen, naming it Ebenezer, meaning "Thus far the Lord has helped us." The Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israel again during Samuel's lifetime. The cities taken by the Philistines were returned to Israel, and there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

Samuel judged Israel throughout his life, traveling annually to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpeh to judge the people. He lived in Ramah, where he also judged Israel and built an altar to the Lord.

When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons, Joel and Abiah, as judges over Israel in Beersheba. However, his sons were corrupt, taking bribes and perverting justice. The elders of Israel came to Samuel at Ramah, asking for a king to judge them like other nations. Samuel was displeased and prayed to the Lord, who told him to listen to the people, as they were rejecting God, not Samuel. God instructed Samuel to warn them about the consequences of having a king.

Samuel conveyed God's message to the people, explaining that a king would take their sons for his army and labor, their daughters for his service, and a portion of their fields, vineyards, and produce for his officials and servants. Despite the warning, the people insisted on having a king to lead and fight for them. Samuel reported their request to the Lord, who told him to grant their wish. Samuel then told the people to return to their cities.

A man named Kish from the tribe of Benjamin had a son named Saul, who was tall and handsome. Kish's donkeys went missing, so he sent Saul and a servant to find them. They searched various regions without success. In the land of Zuph, Saul suggested returning home, but the servant proposed consulting a man of God in a nearby city. They decided to visit the seer, bringing a small silver coin as a gift.

As they approached the city, they met young women drawing water, who directed them to the seer, Samuel. Samuel had been informed by the Lord the previous day that Saul would come and be anointed as the leader of Israel. When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord confirmed that Saul was the chosen one. Saul asked Samuel for directions to the seer's house, and Samuel revealed his identity, inviting Saul to dine with him and promising to disclose God's message the next day.

Samuel reassured Saul about the lost donkeys, which had been found, and hinted at Saul's future importance. Saul, surprised, mentioned his humble background. Samuel then brought Saul and his servant to a banquet, giving Saul a special portion of food. After the meal, Samuel spoke privately with Saul on the rooftop. The next morning, Samuel prepared to send Saul on his way, but first, he anointed Saul with oil, declaring him the chosen leader of Israel. Samuel gave Saul specific signs to confirm his anointment, including meeting men near Rachel's tomb who would inform him that the donkeys were found and that his father was now worried about him.Samuel told Saul that he would meet three men near the oak of Tabor. They would be carrying three young goats, three loaves of bread, and a bottle of wine. They would greet Saul and give him two loaves of bread. After that, Saul would go to the hill of God, where the Philistine garrison was. There, he would meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with musical instruments, and they would be prophesying. The Spirit of the Lord would come upon Saul, and he would prophesy with them, becoming a different person. Samuel instructed Saul to do whatever the situation required because God would be with him. Saul was to go to Gilgal and wait seven days for Samuel to come and offer sacrifices and tell him what to do next.

As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul's heart, and all the signs Samuel had mentioned came to pass that day. When Saul and his servant arrived at the hill, they met the group of prophets, and the Spirit of God came upon Saul, and he prophesied with them. People who knew Saul were surprised and asked if Saul was also among the prophets. This became a saying, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" After prophesying, Saul went to the high place.

Saul's uncle asked him and his servant where they had been. Saul replied that they had been looking for the donkeys and went to Samuel when they couldn't find them. Saul's uncle asked what Samuel had told them, and Saul said that Samuel had told them the donkeys were found but did not mention anything about the kingdom.

Samuel gathered the people at Mizpeh and reminded them that the Lord had brought them out of Egypt and saved them from their enemies. However, they had rejected God by asking for a king. Samuel then had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. From the tribe of Benjamin, the family of Matri was chosen, and Saul, the son of Kish, was selected. But Saul was hiding among the supplies. When they found him and brought him out, he stood taller than anyone else. Samuel told the people that Saul was the one the Lord had chosen, and the people shouted, "Long live the king!"

Samuel explained the rights and duties of kingship and wrote them down on a scroll, which he placed before the Lord. Then he sent everyone home, including Saul, who went to Gibeah with a group of men whose hearts God had touched. However, some troublemakers doubted Saul's ability to lead and did not bring him gifts, but Saul kept silent.

Nahash the Ammonite besieged Jabesh Gilead, and the people of Jabesh asked for a treaty, offering to serve Nahash. Nahash agreed on the condition that he could gouge out the right eye of every man in Jabesh to disgrace Israel. The elders of Jabesh asked for seven days to seek help from Israel. When the messengers reached Gibeah and told the people, they wept. Saul, returning from the fields, asked why they were crying, and they told him about the situation in Jabesh. The Spirit of God came upon Saul, and he became very angry. He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces throughout Israel, warning that anyone who did not follow him and Samuel would have their oxen treated the same way. The fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they united to follow Saul.

Saul mustered the troops at Bezek, counting 300,000 from Israel and 30,000 from Judah. He sent a message to the people of Jabesh Gilead, promising rescue by the next day. The people of Jabesh were overjoyed and told Nahash they would surrender the next day. Saul divided his men into three groups and attacked the Ammonite camp during the morning watch, defeating them and scattering the survivors.

The people then asked Samuel who had doubted Saul's kingship, wanting to put them to death. But Saul declared that no one would be executed that day because the Lord had rescued Israel. Samuel then invited the people to go to Gilgal to renew the kingship. They went to Gilgal, made Saul king before the Lord, and offered sacrifices, rejoicing greatly.

Samuel addressed all Israel, reminding them that he had listened to their request for a king and had appointed one. He asked if he had wronged anyone or taken anything unjustly, and the people confirmed that he had not. Samuel reminded them of the Lord's righteous acts, from bringing their ancestors out of Egypt to delivering them from their enemies. He warned them to follow the Lord and obey His commands, or they would face consequences. To demonstrate their wrongdoing in asking for a king, Samuel called upon the Lord to send thunder and rain during the wheat harvest, which the Lord did, causing the people to fear greatly. They asked Samuel to pray for them, acknowledging their sin in asking for a king. Samuel reassured them not to fear but to serve the Lord faithfully."Don't turn away to follow useless things that can't help or save you. The Lord won't abandon His people because of His great name and because He chose you. As for me, I will continue to pray for you and teach you the right way. Serve the Lord faithfully with all your heart and remember the great things He has done for you. But if you continue to do evil, both you and your king will be destroyed.

Saul reigned for one year, and in his second year, he chose 3,000 men from Israel. He kept 2,000 with him at Michmash and Bethel, and 1,000 with Jonathan in Gibeah. The rest were sent home. Jonathan attacked the Philistine garrison at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, calling the Hebrews to hear. All Israel heard that Saul had attacked the Philistine garrison, making Israel detestable to the Philistines. The people gathered to Saul at Gilgal.

The Philistines assembled to fight Israel with 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They camped at Michmash, east of Beth Aven. When the Israelites saw they were in trouble, they hid in caves, thickets, rocks, high places, and pits. Some crossed the Jordan to Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and the people with him were trembling.

Saul waited seven days, the time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people began to scatter. Saul then offered the burnt offering himself. Just as he finished, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. Samuel asked what Saul had done. Saul explained that he saw the people scattering, Samuel had not arrived on time, and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash. Saul felt compelled to offer the burnt offering to seek the Lord's favor.

Samuel told Saul he had acted foolishly and not kept the Lord's command. If he had, the Lord would have established his kingdom over Israel forever. But now, Saul's kingdom would not endure. The Lord had sought a man after His own heart and appointed him leader because Saul did not keep the Lord's command. Samuel then left Gilgal and went to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted about 600 men with him.

Saul, Jonathan, and their men stayed in Gibeah, while the Philistines camped at Michmash. Raiding parties came from the Philistine camp in three groups, heading toward Ophrah, Beth Horon, and the valley of Zeboim. There were no blacksmiths in Israel because the Philistines had banned them to prevent the Hebrews from making swords or spears. The Israelites had to go to the Philistines to sharpen their tools. On the day of battle, only Saul and Jonathan had swords or spears.

One day, Jonathan told his armor-bearer to go with him to the Philistine outpost on the other side, but he did not tell his father. Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron with about 600 men, including Ahijah, the priest. Jonathan and his armor-bearer crossed a pass with sharp rocks on either side, named Bozez and Seneh. Jonathan suggested they go to the Philistine outpost, believing the Lord could save them regardless of their numbers. His armor-bearer agreed to follow him.

Jonathan proposed they reveal themselves to the Philistines. If the Philistines told them to wait, they would stay put. But if the Philistines invited them up, it would be a sign that the Lord had given them into their hands. When they showed themselves, the Philistines mocked them, saying the Hebrews were coming out of their hiding places. They invited Jonathan and his armor-bearer to come up, and Jonathan took it as a sign. They climbed up, and Jonathan struck down about twenty men in a small area. Panic struck the Philistine camp, and the ground shook, causing great confusion.

Saul's lookouts in Gibeah saw the Philistine army melting away. Saul ordered a count and found Jonathan and his armor-bearer missing. Saul then called for the ark of God. While he was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp increased, and Saul told the priest to stop. Saul and his men joined the battle, finding the Philistines in chaos, fighting each other. Hebrews who had previously joined the Philistines switched sides to fight with Israel. Israelites who had hidden in the hills of Ephraim also joined the battle. The Lord saved Israel that day, and the battle moved beyond Beth Aven.

The Israelites were in distress because Saul had bound them with an oath, cursing anyone who ate food before evening. The troops were exhausted. They came to a forest with honey on the ground, but no one ate because of the oath. Jonathan, unaware of the oath, dipped his staff in the honeycomb and ate, feeling refreshed. When told about the oath, Jonathan criticized his father for troubling the land, noting how much better the victory would have been if the troops had eaten. The Israelites struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, but they were exhausted and pounced on the plunder, eating meat with blood, which was against the law. Saul was informed and ordered a large stone to be rolled over. He instructed the people to slaughter their animals properly and eat without sinning against the Lord. That night, Saul built an altar to the Lord, the first he had built.

Saul then proposed to pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them until dawn. The troops agreed, but the priest suggested seeking God's will first. Saul asked God if he should pursue the Philistines, but received no answer. Saul then gathered the leaders and declared that someone had sinned, vowing that even if it was his son Jonathan, they would die. The people remained silent. Saul and Jonathan were chosen by lot, and Jonathan was identified as the sinner. Jonathan admitted to eating a little honey and was ready to die. But the people defended Jonathan, saying he had brought about the great victory and should not die. They rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death. Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land."Saul was informed that the people were sinning against the Lord by eating meat with blood. He ordered a large stone to be rolled over and instructed everyone to bring their oxen and sheep to be slaughtered properly, so they wouldn't sin against the Lord. That night, everyone brought their animals and slaughtered them there. Saul built an altar to the Lord, the first one he had built.

Saul then suggested attacking the Philistines by night and plundering them until morning. The troops agreed, but the priest advised seeking God's guidance first. Saul asked God if they should pursue the Philistines, but received no answer. Saul then gathered the leaders to find out who had sinned, vowing that even if it was his son Jonathan, they would die. The people remained silent.

Saul and Jonathan were chosen by lot, and Jonathan was identified as the sinner. Jonathan admitted to eating a little honey and was ready to die. However, the people defended Jonathan, saying he had brought about the great victory and should not die. They rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death. Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.

Saul took control of the kingdom of Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side: Moab, Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. He gathered an army and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from those who plundered them. Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishui, and Melchishua, and his daughters were Merab and Michal. His wife was Ahinoam, and the captain of his army was Abner, Saul's uncle's son. There was constant war with the Philistines during Saul's reign, and he recruited any strong or valiant man he saw.

Samuel told Saul that the Lord had sent him to anoint Saul as king over Israel and now commanded him to destroy the Amalekites completely. Saul gathered his troops and attacked the Amalekites, but he spared their king, Agag, and the best of their livestock. The Lord told Samuel that He regretted making Saul king because he had not followed His commands. Samuel confronted Saul, who claimed he had obeyed the Lord but blamed the people for sparing the best livestock to sacrifice to God. Samuel rebuked Saul, saying obedience is better than sacrifice and that rebellion is like witchcraft. Because Saul rejected the Lord's command, the Lord rejected him as king.

Saul admitted his sin and asked Samuel to pardon him and return with him to worship the Lord. Samuel refused, saying the Lord had rejected Saul as king. As Samuel turned to leave, Saul tore his robe, and Samuel declared that the Lord had torn the kingdom from Saul and given it to someone better. Saul pleaded for honor before the elders and Israel, and Samuel reluctantly agreed. Samuel then executed Agag, the Amalekite king, and returned to Ramah, while Saul went to his home in Gibeah. Samuel mourned for Saul, and the Lord regretted making Saul king over Israel.

The Lord instructed Samuel to stop mourning for Saul and go to Jesse of Bethlehem, for He had chosen one of Jesse's sons as king. Samuel feared Saul would kill him if he found out, but the Lord told him to take a heifer and say he was going to sacrifice to the Lord. Samuel did as the Lord commanded and went to Bethlehem. The town's elders trembled at his arrival, but Samuel assured them he came in peace to sacrifice to the Lord. He invited Jesse and his sons to the sacrifice. When Samuel saw Jesse's son Eliab, he thought he was the Lord's anointed, but the Lord told Samuel not to consider his appearance or height, for the Lord looks at the heart, not the outward appearance. Jesse then called his son Abinadab to pass before Samuel.Samuel then asked Jesse if he had any more sons. Jesse mentioned his youngest son, who was tending the sheep. Samuel insisted they bring him, saying they wouldn't sit down until he arrived. When David came, he was handsome and healthy-looking. The Lord told Samuel to anoint him, as he was the chosen one. Samuel anointed David, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day forward. Samuel then returned to Ramah.

Meanwhile, the Spirit of the Lord had left Saul, and he was tormented by an evil spirit. Saul's servants suggested finding someone who could play the harp to soothe him. One servant mentioned David, the son of Jesse, who was skilled at playing the harp and was also a brave warrior. Saul sent for David, and Jesse sent David to Saul with gifts. David entered Saul's service and became his armor-bearer. Whenever the evil spirit troubled Saul, David would play the harp, and Saul would feel better.

The Philistines gathered their armies for battle at a place called Shochoh in Judah. Saul and the Israelites set up camp in the Valley of Elah to face them. The Philistines had a champion named Goliath, who was over nine feet tall and wore heavy armor. Goliath challenged the Israelites to send a man to fight him, saying the losing side would become the servants of the winners. Saul and the Israelites were terrified.

David, the youngest son of Jesse, was tending his father's sheep. Jesse sent David to the battlefield with food for his brothers and to check on them. When David arrived, he heard Goliath's challenge and saw the fear in the Israelite camp. David asked what would be done for the man who defeated Goliath. His brothers scolded him, but David persisted.

David was brought to Saul and offered to fight Goliath. Saul doubted David's ability, but David recounted how he had killed lions and bears while protecting his sheep. He believed the Lord would deliver him from Goliath as well. Saul agreed and gave David his armor, but David found it cumbersome and took it off. Instead, he took his staff, five smooth stones, and his sling.

As David approached Goliath, the giant mocked him. David responded that he came in the name of the Lord and that the Lord would deliver Goliath into his hands. David ran towards Goliath, slung a stone, and struck Goliath on the forehead, killing him. David then used Goliath's sword to cut off his head. The Philistines fled, and the Israelites pursued them, winning a great victory.David's stone hit Goliath in the forehead, sinking in and causing him to fall face down on the ground. David defeated Goliath with just a sling and a stone, without a sword. He then ran over, took Goliath's sword, and used it to cut off his head. Seeing their champion dead, the Philistines fled. The Israelites and men of Judah chased them down, killing many along the way and plundering their camp. David took Goliath's head to Jerusalem but kept his armor in his tent.

When Saul saw David going out to fight Goliath, he asked his commander, Abner, about David's family. Abner didn't know, so Saul asked David directly. David replied that he was the son of Jesse from Bethlehem. After David finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan, Saul's son, formed a deep bond with David and loved him as himself. Saul kept David with him and didn't let him return home. Jonathan and David made a covenant because of their strong friendship. Jonathan gave David his robe, armor, sword, bow, and belt.

David succeeded in everything Saul sent him to do, and Saul made him a high-ranking officer. This pleased all the people and Saul's servants. When David returned from killing Goliath, women from all over Israel came out singing and dancing to celebrate, praising David for killing tens of thousands compared to Saul's thousands. This made Saul very angry and jealous, fearing that David might take over the kingdom.

The next day, an evil spirit from God tormented Saul, and he tried to kill David with a javelin while David was playing the harp. David escaped twice. Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with David but had left Saul. Saul then made David a commander over a thousand men, and David continued to succeed in everything he did because the Lord was with him. This made Saul even more afraid, but all of Israel and Judah loved David.

Saul offered his older daughter, Merab, to David in marriage, hoping the Philistines would kill David in battle. David humbly questioned his worthiness to be the king's son-in-law. However, Merab was given to another man. Saul's other daughter, Michal, loved David, and Saul saw this as another opportunity to trap David. Saul told David he could marry Michal if he brought back 100 Philistine foreskins, hoping David would be killed in the process. David succeeded, bringing back 200 foreskins, and married Michal. Saul realized the Lord was with David and that Michal loved him, making Saul even more fearful and hostile towards David.

David continued to succeed in battles, gaining more respect than all of Saul's other officers. Saul then ordered his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. Jonathan, who loved David, warned him to hide and spoke well of him to Saul. Saul swore not to kill David, and Jonathan brought David back to Saul's service. However, another war broke out, and David again defeated the Philistines. Saul, tormented by an evil spirit, tried to kill David with a javelin again, but David escaped.

Saul sent men to David's house to kill him, but Michal helped David escape through a window. She then deceived Saul's men by placing an idol in David's bed. When Saul confronted Michal, she claimed David had threatened her. David fled to Samuel in Ramah, and they stayed in Naioth. Saul sent men to capture David, but they ended up prophesying under the influence of the Spirit of God. This happened three times. Finally, Saul went himself, but he too was overcome by the Spirit and prophesied, lying naked all day and night.

David fled from Naioth in Ramah and asked Jonathan why Saul wanted to kill him, questioning what he had done wrong.Jonathan reassured David, saying, "Don't worry, you won't die. My father tells me everything, big or small. Why would he hide this from me? It can't be true." But David insisted, "Your father knows we're close friends, so he won't tell you. But as surely as the Lord lives, I'm just a step away from death." Jonathan then asked, "What do you want me to do?" David replied, "Tomorrow is the new moon festival, and I should be dining with the king. Let me hide in the field until the evening of the third day. If your father notices I'm missing, tell him I asked to go to Bethlehem for a family sacrifice. If he says it's okay, then I'm safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he intends to harm me. Please be kind to me, as we've made a covenant before the Lord. If I'm guilty, kill me yourself rather than bringing me to your father." Jonathan responded, "Never! If I knew my father planned to harm you, I'd tell you."

David then asked, "How will you let me know if your father answers harshly?" Jonathan suggested they go out to the field. There, Jonathan said, "By tomorrow or the next day, I'll find out my father's intentions. If he's favorable towards you, I'll send word. But if he plans to harm you, I'll let you know so you can escape safely. May the Lord be with you as He was with my father. Show me the Lord's kindness while I'm alive, and don't ever cut off your kindness from my family, even when the Lord has eliminated all your enemies." Jonathan made a covenant with David's house, and they reaffirmed their bond because Jonathan loved David as himself.

Jonathan then instructed David, "Tomorrow is the new moon festival, and you'll be missed because your seat will be empty. After three days, go to the place where you hid before and stay by the stone Ezel. I'll shoot three arrows as if aiming at a target. If I tell the boy fetching the arrows, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you,' then you can come back safely. But if I say, 'The arrows are beyond you,' then you must leave, for the Lord is sending you away. Remember, the Lord is witness between us forever."

David hid in the field, and when the new moon festival came, the king sat down to eat. Saul noticed David's absence but thought he might be ceremonially unclean. On the second day, Saul asked Jonathan why David wasn't at the meal. Jonathan explained that David had asked to go to Bethlehem for a family sacrifice. Saul became furious with Jonathan, accusing him of siding with David to his own shame. He declared that as long as David lived, Jonathan's kingdom would not be established and ordered Jonathan to bring David to him to be killed. Jonathan questioned why David should be killed, and Saul threw a javelin at him. Jonathan realized his father was determined to kill David.

The next morning, Jonathan went to the field with a boy and shot an arrow beyond him, signaling David to flee. Jonathan sent the boy back to the city with his gear. David then came out from hiding, bowed to Jonathan, and they wept together. Jonathan told David to go in peace, reaffirming their covenant in the Lord's name. David then left, and Jonathan returned to the city.

David went to Nob to see Ahimelech the priest, who was alarmed to see him alone. David explained that he was on a secret mission from the king and asked for food. Ahimelech gave him consecrated bread, as there was no other bread available. David also asked for a weapon, and Ahimelech gave him the sword of Goliath. David then fled to Achish, the king of Gath. When Achish's servants recognized him, David pretended to be insane to avoid harm. Achish dismissed him, saying he had enough madmen already.

David escaped to the cave of Adullam, where his family and others in distress joined him, forming a group of about 400 men. David then went to Mizpeh in Moab, asking the king to shelter his parents until he knew God's plan for him. The prophet Gad later advised David to leave the stronghold and go to the land of Judah.David left and went to the forest of Hareth. When Saul heard that David and his men had been found, he was in Gibeah, sitting under a tree with his spear in hand, surrounded by his servants. Saul addressed his servants, accusing them of conspiring with David and not informing him about Jonathan's alliance with David. Doeg the Edomite, one of Saul's servants, reported seeing David with Ahimelech the priest, who had provided David with food and the sword of Goliath.

Saul summoned Ahimelech and all the priests from Nob. When they arrived, Saul accused Ahimelech of conspiring with David. Ahimelech defended himself, stating that David was a loyal servant and son-in-law to the king. He claimed ignorance of any conspiracy. Despite this, Saul ordered the death of Ahimelech and his family. Saul's servants refused to kill the priests, so Doeg carried out the order, killing 85 priests and destroying the city of Nob, including its inhabitants and livestock.

One of Ahimelech's sons, Abiathar, escaped and joined David, informing him of the massacre. David acknowledged his role in the tragedy and assured Abiathar of his protection.

David then learned that the Philistines were attacking Keilah and sought God's guidance on whether to intervene. God instructed David to save Keilah. Despite his men's fear, David obeyed and defeated the Philistines, saving the town. Abiathar brought an ephod to David, which he used to seek further guidance from God.

Saul heard of David's presence in Keilah and planned to besiege the town. David, aware of Saul's intentions, asked God if the people of Keilah would betray him. God confirmed they would, so David and his 600 men left Keilah and wandered in the wilderness. Saul continued to pursue David, but God protected him.

Jonathan visited David in the wilderness, encouraging him and reaffirming their covenant. The Ziphites informed Saul of David's location, prompting Saul to pursue him again. David narrowly escaped when Saul was called away to deal with a Philistine invasion. David then moved to the strongholds of Engedi.

Saul, upon returning from the Philistine battle, resumed his search for David with 3,000 men. Saul entered a cave to rest, unaware that David and his men were hiding inside. David's men urged him to kill Saul, but David only cut off a piece of Saul's robe, later feeling guilty for even that. David revealed himself to Saul, showing the piece of the robe as proof of his loyalty and lack of ill intent. Saul, moved by David's gesture, acknowledged David's righteousness and predicted his future as king.David said to Saul, "Why are you chasing me? I'm like a dead dog or a flea. Let the Lord judge between us and save me from your hand." When David finished speaking, Saul recognized his voice and wept, admitting that David was more righteous for repaying good for evil. Saul acknowledged that David would be king and asked him to swear not to destroy his descendants. David agreed, and Saul went home while David and his men returned to their stronghold.

After Samuel died, David moved to the wilderness of Paran. There was a wealthy man named Nabal in Maon, who was harsh and evil, but his wife Abigail was intelligent and beautiful. David sent men to ask Nabal for provisions, reminding him of the protection they had provided his shepherds. Nabal insulted David's men, refusing to help. David, angered, prepared to attack Nabal.

One of Nabal's servants informed Abigail of the situation. She quickly gathered supplies and went to meet David, pleading for mercy and taking the blame for her husband's actions. She reminded David that God had kept him from bloodshed and asked him to accept her gift. David praised her wisdom and accepted the provisions, promising not to harm Nabal's household.

When Abigail told Nabal what had happened, he had a heart attack and died ten days later. David praised God for avenging him and sent for Abigail to become his wife. She agreed and joined David, along with her maidservants. David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, while Saul gave David's first wife, Michal, to another man.

The Ziphites informed Saul of David's location, prompting Saul to pursue him with 3,000 men. David, aware of Saul's approach, sent spies and confirmed Saul's presence. David and Abishai snuck into Saul's camp at night, finding Saul asleep with his spear stuck in the ground beside him.David and Abishai found Saul asleep with his spear stuck in the ground beside him, surrounded by his men. Abishai suggested killing Saul, but David refused, saying it was wrong to harm the Lord's anointed. Instead, David took Saul's spear and water jug and left. 

From a safe distance, David called out to Abner, Saul's commander, questioning why he hadn't protected the king. Saul recognized David's voice and admitted his wrongdoing, asking David to return. David showed the spear as proof of his mercy and reiterated his trust in God's justice. Saul blessed David, acknowledging his future success, and they parted ways.

David, fearing for his life, decided to escape to the land of the Philistines. He and his men, along with their families, settled in Gath under King Achish. Saul stopped pursuing David upon hearing this. David requested a place in the countryside, and Achish gave him Ziklag, where David lived for a year and four months.

During this time, David and his men raided various groups, leaving no survivors to report back to Gath. Achish trusted David, believing he had turned against Israel. 

The Philistines prepared for war against Israel, and Achish expected David to join them. David agreed, and Achish promised to make him his personal bodyguard.

Meanwhile, Saul, desperate for guidance as the Philistines gathered for battle, sought out a medium in Endor. Disguised, he asked her to summon Samuel. When Samuel appeared, he rebuked Saul for disturbing him and foretold Saul's defeat and death in the upcoming battle. Saul, terrified and weak from fasting, was persuaded by the medium and his servants to eat before returning to his camp.The Philistines gathered their armies at Aphek, while the Israelites camped by a spring in Jezreel. The Philistine leaders marched in units of hundreds and thousands, with David and his men at the rear with Achish. The Philistine commanders questioned Achish about David's presence, reminding him that David was once Saul's servant and had been with them for a long time without causing trouble. However, the commanders were angry and insisted that David should not join them in battle, fearing he might turn against them to regain favor with Saul.

Achish called David and told him that although he trusted him, the other leaders did not. He asked David to return to the place he had been given and not join the battle. David questioned what he had done wrong, but Achish reassured him that he was trusted like an angel of God. Despite this, the commanders' decision stood, and David was to leave early the next morning.

David and his men left early and returned to the land of the Philistines, while the Philistines advanced to Jezreel. When David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day, they found it had been attacked and burned by the Amalekites, who had taken their families captive. David and his men were devastated and wept until they had no strength left. David's two wives were also taken captive.

David was deeply distressed as his men spoke of stoning him out of grief for their families. However, David found strength in the Lord. He asked Abiathar the priest to bring him the ephod and inquired of the Lord whether he should pursue the raiders. The Lord told him to pursue, promising that he would overtake them and recover everything.

David set out with his 600 men, but 200 were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor, so they stayed behind. David and the remaining 400 men continued the pursuit. They found an Egyptian in the field, gave him food and water, and revived him. The Egyptian revealed he was a servant of an Amalekite and had been left behind when he fell ill. He confirmed that the Amalekites had raided the south and burned Ziklag.

David asked the Egyptian to lead him to the raiders, and the man agreed on the condition that David would not kill him or return him to his master. The Egyptian led David to the Amalekites, who were spread out, celebrating their plunder. David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day, recovering everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. Nothing was missing, and David took all the flocks and herds, declaring them his spoil.

When David returned to the 200 men who had stayed behind, some of the men who had fought with him did not want to share the plunder with them. David insisted that everyone should share equally, as the Lord had preserved them and delivered their enemies into their hands. This became a lasting ordinance in Israel.

David also sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah and his friends, sharing the spoils with those in various towns where he and his men had roamed.

Meanwhile, the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled, with many falling on Mount Gilboa. The Philistines killed Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. Saul was critically wounded by archers and asked his armor-bearer to kill him to avoid capture. When the armor-bearer refused, Saul fell on his own sword. Seeing Saul dead, the armor-bearer also killed himself. Thus, Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that day.

The Israelites on the other side of the valley and the Jordan saw the defeat and fled, allowing the Philistines to occupy their towns. The next day, the Philistines found Saul and his sons' bodies on Mount Gilboa. They beheaded Saul, stripped his armor, and sent it throughout their land to proclaim their victory. They placed his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth and fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.

When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done, their valiant men retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons, burned them, and buried their bones under a tree in Jabesh, fasting for seven days.

After Saul's death, David returned to Ziklag from defeating the Amalekites. On the third day, a man arrived from Saul's camp with torn clothes and dirt on his head, showing respect to David. David asked him where he came from, and the man replied that he had escaped from the Israelite camp. David inquired about the battle, and the man reported that the people had fled, many were dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan were also dead.David asked the young man how he knew Saul and Jonathan were dead. The young man, an Amalekite, explained that he found Saul on Mount Gilboa, leaning on his spear with chariots and horsemen closing in. Saul saw him and asked who he was. When the young man replied he was an Amalekite, Saul asked him to kill him to end his suffering. The young man did so, took Saul's crown and bracelet, and brought them to David.

David and his men mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, Jonathan, and the fallen people of Israel. David then questioned the young man about his background and why he wasn't afraid to kill the Lord's anointed. David ordered one of his men to kill the young Amalekite for his actions.

David lamented over Saul and Jonathan, expressing his grief and honoring their bravery and unity in life and death. He instructed the people of Judah to learn the use of the bow, as recorded in the Book of Jasher. David's lament highlighted the loss of Israel's beauty and strength, urging that the news not be spread to avoid the Philistines' rejoicing.

David then asked the Lord if he should go to any city in Judah, and the Lord directed him to Hebron. David, his two wives, and his men moved to Hebron, where the men of Judah anointed him king over the house of Judah. David sent a message to the men of Jabesh-gilead, thanking them for burying Saul and encouraging them to be strong and valiant.

Meanwhile, Abner, the commander of Saul's army, made Saul's son Ishbosheth king over Israel, except for Judah, which followed David. Ishbosheth reigned for two years, while David was king in Hebron for seven and a half years. A battle ensued between Abner's and David's forces, resulting in heavy losses for Abner's men.

During the battle, Asahel, one of David's men, pursued Abner but was killed. Joab and Abishai continued the pursuit until Abner called for a truce, which Joab accepted. Both sides retreated, and David's forces returned to Hebron.

The conflict between the houses of Saul and David continued, with David growing stronger. David had several sons born in Hebron. Abner, strengthening his position in Saul's house, had a falling out with Ishbosheth over a concubine. Angered, Abner decided to support David, offering to bring all Israel under David's rule. David agreed, on the condition that Abner bring Saul's daughter Michal to him.David told Abner that he wouldn't see him unless he brought Michal, Saul's daughter. David then sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, demanding Michal, his wife, whom he had married for a bride price of 100 Philistine foreskins. Ishbosheth took Michal from her husband, Phaltiel, who followed her weeping until Abner told him to go back.

Abner spoke to the elders of Israel, reminding them that they had wanted David as king and that God had promised David would save Israel from their enemies. Abner also spoke to the tribe of Benjamin and then went to Hebron to meet David with 20 men. David hosted a feast for them. Abner promised to gather all Israel to support David as king, and David sent him away in peace.

When Joab returned from a raid and learned that David had let Abner go, he confronted David, accusing Abner of deceit. Joab then secretly sent for Abner and killed him to avenge his brother Asahel's death. David declared his innocence in Abner's death and cursed Joab's family. David mourned Abner, and all the people wept with him, understanding that David had not ordered Abner's death.

When Ishbosheth heard of Abner's death, he lost courage, and all Israel was troubled. Ishbosheth had two captains, Baanah and Rechab, who killed him while he was resting at noon. They brought his head to David, expecting a reward. Instead, David condemned them for killing an innocent man and had them executed. Ishbosheth's head was buried in Abner's tomb.

All the tribes of Israel then came to David at Hebron, acknowledging him as their leader. They anointed David king over Israel. David was 30 years old when he began to reign, ruling Judah for seven and a half years and all Israel and Judah for 33 years. David captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites and made it his city, growing stronger with God's support.

King Hiram of Tyre sent materials and workers to build David a palace. David realized that God had established his kingdom for the sake of Israel. He took more wives and concubines in Jerusalem, and many children were born to him.

When the Philistines heard that David was king over Israel, they attacked. David sought God's guidance and defeated them at Baal-perazim. The Philistines attacked again, and God instructed David to circle behind them and wait for the sound of marching in the mulberry trees. David followed God's command and defeated the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.David gathered 30,000 chosen men of Israel and went with them to bring the Ark of God from Baale of Judah. They placed the Ark on a new cart, driven by Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab. As they transported the Ark, David and the Israelites celebrated with various musical instruments. When they reached Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah touched the Ark to steady it, and God struck him down for his error. David was upset and named the place Perezuzzah. Fearing the Lord, David decided not to bring the Ark into the City of David but instead took it to the house of Obededom the Gittite, where it stayed for three months, blessing Obededom's household.

Hearing of these blessings, David brought the Ark to the City of David with great joy. After every six steps, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. David danced with all his might, wearing a linen ephod, and the Israelites celebrated with shouts and trumpet sounds. Michal, Saul's daughter, saw David dancing and despised him. The Ark was placed in a tent David had set up, and he offered burnt and peace offerings. David then blessed the people and distributed food to everyone before they returned home.

When David returned to bless his household, Michal criticized him for dancing shamelessly. David responded that he danced before the Lord, who chose him over her father Saul, and would continue to do so. Michal remained childless until her death.

Later, as David rested from his enemies, he expressed to the prophet Nathan his desire to build a house for the Ark of God. Nathan initially encouraged him, but that night, God told Nathan to inform David that He had never asked for a house of cedar. God reminded David of his humble beginnings as a shepherd and His support in making David a great leader. God promised to establish a place for Israel and to build a house for David's lineage, ensuring his kingdom's eternal legacy. David's son would build a house for God's name, and his throne would be established forever. God assured David of His unwavering mercy, unlike with Saul.

David humbly thanked God for His promises and prayed for their fulfillment, praising God's greatness and His unique relationship with Israel. David then defeated the Philistines, Moabites, and Hadadezer, king of Zobah, taking many captives and spoils. He also subdued the Syrians of Damascus, who became his servants and brought gifts. David dedicated the silver and gold from these conquests to the Lord, further establishing his reign and God's favor.David gained fame after defeating the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, killing 18,000 men. He established military outposts throughout Edom, and the Edomites became his servants. The Lord protected David wherever he went. David ruled over all Israel, ensuring justice and fairness for everyone. Joab, son of Zeruiah, led the army; Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the recorder; Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, were priests; Seraiah was the scribe; Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, commanded the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were chief officials.

David asked if anyone from Saul's family was still alive so he could show kindness for Jonathan's sake. A servant named Ziba informed him that Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth, who was lame in both feet, was living in Lodebar. David brought Mephibosheth to Jerusalem, assured him not to fear, and promised to restore Saul's land to him and have him eat at the king's table always. Mephibosheth humbly accepted, and David instructed Ziba and his family to farm the land for Mephibosheth. Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem and ate at the king's table, despite his disability.

After the king of the Ammonites died, David sent messengers to console his son Hanun. However, Hanun's advisors suspected David's intentions and humiliated the messengers. David, hearing of this, instructed the messengers to stay in Jericho until their beards grew back. The Ammonites, realizing they had angered David, hired Syrian mercenaries. David sent Joab and his army to confront them. Joab divided his forces, and they successfully defeated the Syrians and Ammonites. The Syrians regrouped but were again defeated by David, who killed many of their soldiers and their commander, Shobach. The remaining Syrian kings made peace with Israel and served them, fearing to help the Ammonites again.

In the spring, when kings typically go to war, David sent Joab and the army to besiege Rabbah, but he stayed in Jerusalem. One evening, David saw a beautiful woman, Bathsheba, bathing. He learned she was the wife of Uriah the Hittite. David summoned her, slept with her, and she became pregnant. David called Uriah back from the battlefield, hoping he would sleep with his wife and cover up the pregnancy. Uriah, however, refused to go home while his comrades were in battle. David then made Uriah drunk, but he still didn't go home. David sent Uriah back to the front lines with a letter instructing Joab to place him in a dangerous position where he would be killed. Uriah died in battle, and Joab reported back to David.David received news that Uriah the Hittite had died in battle. He told the messenger to encourage Joab, saying that the sword takes one person as well as another, and to strengthen their attack on the city. When Uriah's wife, Bathsheba, heard of his death, she mourned. After her mourning period, David brought her to his house, made her his wife, and she bore him a son. However, the Lord was displeased with David's actions.

The Lord sent the prophet Nathan to David. Nathan told David a parable about a rich man with many flocks and a poor man with only one beloved lamb. When a traveler came to the rich man, he took the poor man's lamb to prepare a meal instead of using one of his own. David was furious and declared that the man deserved to die and must repay fourfold for his lack of pity. Nathan then revealed that David was the man in the parable, condemning him for taking Uriah's wife and having Uriah killed.

Nathan conveyed God's message: God had given David everything, yet David despised His command by committing this evil. As a consequence, violence would plague David's family, and his wives would be given to someone close to him in broad daylight. David confessed his sin, and Nathan assured him that God had forgiven him, but the child born to Bathsheba would die. The child became very ill, and David fasted and prayed for its recovery. Despite his efforts, the child died on the seventh day. David's servants hesitated to inform him, fearing his reaction, but David realized the child had died and accepted it. He then washed, changed clothes, worshipped in the house of the Lord, and ate.

David explained to his servants that while the child was alive, he hoped for God's grace, but now that the child was dead, fasting was futile. He comforted Bathsheba, and they had another son named Solomon, whom the Lord loved. Nathan the prophet named him Jedidiah, meaning "loved by the Lord."

Meanwhile, Joab continued to fight against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal city. He urged David to gather the rest of the troops to take the city, ensuring it would be named after David. David led the final assault, took the city, and claimed the king's crown, which was very heavy and adorned with precious stones. He also took a great amount of spoil from the city and subjected its people to forced labor. David and his army then returned to Jerusalem.

After these events, David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, whom their half-brother Amnon loved. Amnon became obsessed with Tamar and, with the help of his cunning friend Jonadab, devised a plan to be alone with her. Pretending to be ill, Amnon requested Tamar to prepare food for him. When she brought the food to his room, he forced himself on her despite her pleas. Afterward, Amnon's love turned to intense hatred, and he cruelly sent her away. Tamar, devastated, went to her brother Absalom's house, who advised her to stay quiet about the incident. King David was furious when he heard about it, but Absalom said nothing to Amnon, though he hated him for what he had done to Tamar.

Two years later, Absalom invited all the king's sons to a sheep-shearing event. He insisted that Amnon join them, despite David's initial reluctance.Absalom invited all the king's sons to a sheep-shearing event and insisted that Amnon join them. When Amnon was drunk, Absalom ordered his servants to kill him. The other sons fled on their mules. News reached David that all his sons were dead, but Jonadab clarified that only Amnon was killed, as Absalom had planned since Amnon assaulted Tamar. Absalom fled to Geshur and stayed there for three years. David longed to see Absalom, as he had come to terms with Amnon's death.

Joab noticed David's longing for Absalom and devised a plan. He sent a wise woman from Tekoa to pretend to be in mourning and tell David a story about her two sons, one of whom killed the other. She pleaded for the king's protection for her remaining son. David promised her safety, and she revealed that her story was a metaphor for Absalom's situation. David realized Joab's involvement and agreed to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem but did not allow him to see the king.

Absalom returned to Jerusalem and lived there for two years without seeing David. Frustrated, he set Joab's field on fire to get his attention. Joab arranged a meeting with the king, and Absalom bowed before David, who kissed him, signifying reconciliation.

Absalom then began to build his support by presenting himself as a just and approachable leader. He gained the favor of many Israelites. After four years, he asked David for permission to go to Hebron to fulfill a vow. David agreed, but Absalom used the opportunity to declare himself king. He gathered followers, including David's advisor Ahithophel, and the conspiracy grew stronger. A messenger informed David that Absalom had won the hearts of the Israelites, prompting David to flee Jerusalem with his servants to avoid a violent confrontation."Your servants are ready to do whatever you command, my lord the king," they said. So the king and his entire household set out, leaving behind ten concubines to take care of the palace. As they departed, they stopped at a distant place. All of David's servants, including the Cherethites, Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed before him.

David then spoke to Ittai the Gittite, "Why are you coming with us? Go back and stay with the new king, for you are a foreigner and an exile. You only arrived yesterday, so why should you wander with us? Go back and take your people with you. May the Lord show you kindness and faithfulness."

But Ittai replied, "As surely as the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether in life or death, there will your servant be."

David said to Ittai, "Go ahead, march on." So Ittai the Gittite and all his men and their families went on. The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.

Zadok and all the Levites with him were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had left the city. Then the king instructed Zadok, "Take the Ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the Lord's eyes, He will bring me back and let me see it and His dwelling place again. But if He says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let Him do to me whatever seems good to Him."

The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace with your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar. I will wait at the fords in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me." So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.

David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered, and he was barefoot. All the people with him also covered their heads and wept as they went up. Someone told David, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." So David prayed, "Lord, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."

When David reached the summit where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head. David said to him, "If you go with me, you will be a burden to me. But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'Your Majesty, I will be your servant; I was your father's servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,' then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's advice. Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace. Their two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear."

So Hushai, David's friend, arrived in Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.

When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, met him with a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a skin of wine. The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?"

Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness."

The king then asked, "Where is your master's grandson?"

Ziba said to him, "He is staying in Jerusalem because he thinks, 'Today the Israelites will restore to me my grandfather's kingdom.'"

Then the king said to Ziba, "All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours."

"I humbly bow," Ziba said. "May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king."

As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul's family came out from there. His name was Shimei, son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out. He pelted David and all the king's officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David's right and left. As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out, get out, you murderer, you scoundrel! The Lord has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The Lord has given the kingdom into the hands of your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a murderer!"

Then Abishai, son of Zeruiah, said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head."

But the king said, "What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the Lord said to him, 'Curse David,' who can ask, 'Why do you do this?'"

David then said to Abishai and all his officials, "My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to. It may be that the Lord will look upon my misery and restore to me His covenant blessing instead of His curse today."

So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt. The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.

Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. Then Hushai the Arkite, David's confidant, went to Absalom and said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"

Absalom said to Hushai, "So this is the love you show your friend? If he's your friend, why didn't you go with him?"

Hushai said to Absalom, "No, the one chosen by the Lord, by these people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and I will remain with him. Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you."

Absalom then said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?"

Ahithophel answered, "Sleep with your father's concubines, whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself obnoxious to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be more resolute." So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

Now in those days, the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel's advice.

Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David. I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed."

This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel. But Absalom said, "Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say as well."

When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, "Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion."

Hushai replied to Absalom, "The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time. You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced warrior; he will not spend the night with the troops. Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first, whoever hears about it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.' Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.

"So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba—as numerous as the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle. Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive. If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not so much as a pebble is left."

Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel." For the Lord had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.Hushai informed the priests Zadok and Abiathar about Ahithophel's advice to Absalom and the elders of Israel, as well as his own counsel. He urged them to quickly send a message to David, warning him not to stay in the wilderness but to cross over immediately to avoid being trapped. Jonathan and Ahimaaz, who were staying at Enrogel, received the message from a servant girl and relayed it to David. However, a boy saw them and reported it to Absalom, prompting them to hide in a well at a man's house in Bahurim. The man's wife covered the well and spread grain over it to conceal them. When Absalom's servants came looking for Jonathan and Ahimaaz, she misled them, saying they had crossed the brook. After the servants left, Jonathan and Ahimaaz emerged from the well and informed David, urging him to cross the river quickly. David and his people crossed the Jordan River by morning.

When Ahithophel realized his advice was not followed, he went home, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. He was buried in his father's tomb. David reached Mahanaim, while Absalom and the Israelites crossed the Jordan. Absalom appointed Amasa as the new commander of the army, replacing Joab. David received supplies and support from Shobi, Machir, and Barzillai, who brought food and provisions for him and his people.

David organized his troops, appointing commanders over thousands and hundreds. He divided his forces into three groups, led by Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. Although David wanted to join the battle, his people insisted he stay behind for their safety. David agreed and instructed his commanders to deal gently with Absalom. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim, where David's forces defeated the Israelites, resulting in a heavy loss of 20,000 men. The forest claimed more lives than the sword.

During the battle, Absalom got caught in the branches of a large oak tree while riding a mule. A man saw him and reported it to Joab, who questioned why he didn't kill Absalom. The man refused, citing David's command to protect Absalom. Joab then took three spears and thrust them into Absalom's heart, and his armor-bearers finished him off. Joab blew the trumpet to halt the pursuit, and Absalom's body was thrown into a pit and covered with stones. The Israelites fled to their homes.

Ahimaaz, eager to deliver the news to David, was initially denied by Joab but eventually allowed to run. He outran another messenger, Cushi, and reached David first. When David asked about Absalom, Ahimaaz evaded the question. Cushi arrived and informed David that the Lord had avenged him, but David was more concerned about Absalom's fate. Upon hearing of Absalom's death, David was deeply grieved and mourned for his son.

Joab confronted David, accusing him of shaming his loyal servants by mourning for Absalom instead of celebrating their victory. He urged David to encourage his troops, warning that failure to do so would result in their desertion. David heeded Joab's advice, sat at the gate, and the people came before him.The tribes of Israel were in conflict, saying, "The king saved us from our enemies and the Philistines, but now he has fled because of Absalom. Absalom, whom we anointed, is dead. Why aren't we bringing the king back?" King David sent a message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, asking them to speak to the elders of Judah, questioning why they were the last to bring him back. He reminded them that they were his kin and urged them to bring him back. He also told them to inform Amasa that he would be the new commander of the army, replacing Joab.

David's message won over the hearts of the men of Judah, who then invited him to return with all his servants. David returned and crossed the Jordan River, where the people of Judah met him at Gilgal to escort him. Shimei, a Benjamite, hurried to meet David with a thousand men from Benjamin, along with Ziba, Saul's servant, and his family. Shimei begged David for forgiveness for his past wrongdoings. Abishai, son of Zeruiah, suggested that Shimei be put to death for cursing David, but David refused, declaring that no one would be executed that day.

Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also came to meet David. He had not taken care of himself since David left. When David asked why he didn't join him, Mephibosheth explained that his servant deceived him because he was lame. David decided that Mephibosheth and Ziba would divide the land. Mephibosheth expressed his contentment with David's safe return.

Barzillai the Gileadite, an elderly man who had supported David, also came to escort him. David invited Barzillai to stay with him in Jerusalem, but Barzillai declined, preferring to return home to die near his parents' graves. He suggested that Chimham go with David instead, and David agreed.

As David crossed the Jordan, the people of Judah and half of Israel accompanied him. The men of Israel questioned why the men of Judah had taken David without consulting them, leading to a heated argument. A man named Sheba, son of Bichri, incited a rebellion against David, causing the Israelites to abandon David and follow Sheba. However, the men of Judah remained loyal to David.

David returned to his house in Jerusalem and confined the ten concubines he had left to take care of the house, providing for them but not visiting them. David then ordered Amasa to assemble the men of Judah within three days, but Amasa took longer than expected. David instructed Abishai to pursue Sheba before he could fortify himself in a city. Joab's men, along with the Cherethites, Pelethites, and other warriors, set out to pursue Sheba.

At Gibeon, Joab met Amasa and, under the pretense of greeting him, killed him. Joab and Abishai continued their pursuit of Sheba. They besieged Sheba in the city of Abel Beth Maacah. A wise woman from the city negotiated with Joab, agreeing to deliver Sheba's head to him to save the city. The woman convinced the people, and they executed Sheba, throwing his head over the wall to Joab. Joab then called off the siege and returned to Jerusalem.In her wisdom, the woman convinced the people to cut off Sheba's head and throw it to Joab. Joab then blew a trumpet, signaling his men to retreat from the city and return to their tents. Joab went back to Jerusalem to report to King David.

Joab was in charge of Israel's army, Benaiah son of Jehoiada led the Cherethites and Pelethites, Adoram managed the tribute, Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder, Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests. Ira the Jairite was also a chief official under David.

During David's reign, there was a three-year famine. David sought the Lord, who revealed that it was due to Saul's actions against the Gibeonites. David asked the Gibeonites how he could make amends. They requested the execution of seven of Saul's male descendants. David agreed but spared Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son, due to his oath with Jonathan. He handed over two sons of Rizpah and five sons of Michal, who were then executed by the Gibeonites.

Rizpah mourned and protected the bodies until rain fell. David, hearing of her actions, retrieved the bones of Saul and Jonathan from Jabesh Gilead and buried them in Saul's family tomb. After this, God ended the famine.

The Philistines waged war again, and David, along with his men, fought them. David grew tired, and Ishbibenob, a giant's descendant, tried to kill him. Abishai saved David and killed the Philistine. David's men insisted he no longer join battles to preserve his life.

In subsequent battles, Sibbechai killed Saph, another giant's descendant, and Elhanan killed Goliath's brother. Jonathan, David's nephew, killed a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. These giants were defeated by David and his men.

David sang a song of praise to the Lord for delivering him from his enemies and from Saul. He described the Lord as his rock, fortress, deliverer, shield, and savior. David recounted how the Lord responded to his cries for help, shaking the earth and scattering his enemies with lightning. He praised the Lord for rewarding his righteousness and for being his strength and protection. David vowed to continue trusting in the Lord, who had always been his refuge and salvation.David, the son of Jesse, spoke these words: "The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me, and His words were on my tongue. The God of Israel said, 'The Rock of Israel spoke to me: The one who rules over people must be just, ruling in the fear of God. He will be like the light of the morning at sunrise, a morning without clouds, like the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.' Even though my house is not perfect with God, He has made an everlasting covenant with me, ordered and secure in every way. This is all my salvation and all my desire, even though He does not make it grow. But the wicked are like thorns that are thrown away, for they cannot be handled. Whoever touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear; they will be completely burned up where they lie."

These are the names of David's mighty warriors: Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter. Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the Israelites retreated, but Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day; the troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.

Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them. But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the Lord brought about a great victory.

During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. At that time, David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!" So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem, and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the Lord. "Far be it from me, Lord, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it.

Abishai, the brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them.

Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

Among the Thirty were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem, Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite, Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the ravines of Gaash, Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite, Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, the son of Hagri, Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah, Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all.

Once again, the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and He incited David against them, saying, "Go and take a census of Israel and Judah." So the king said to Joab and the army commanders with him, "Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are." But Joab replied to the king, "May the Lord your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?" The king’s word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.

After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer. They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon. Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah. After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel, there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah, five hundred thousand.

David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing." Before David got up the next morning, the word of the Lord had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer: "Go and tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’" So Gad went to David and said to him, "Shall there come on you three years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me."

David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for His mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands." So the Lord sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the Lord was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the Lord, "I have sinned; I, the shepherd, have done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall on me and my family." On that day Gad went to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite." So David went up, as the Lord had commanded through Gad. When Araunah looked and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.

Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" "To buy your threshing floor," David answered, "so I can build an altar to the Lord, that the plague on the people may be stopped." Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. Your Majesty, Araunah gives all this to the king." Araunah also said to him, "May the Lord your God accept you."

But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them. David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered his prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.

As King David grew old and advanced in years, his servants covered him with blankets, but he could not keep warm. So they said to him, "Let us find a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm." Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no sexual relations with her.Adonijah, son of Haggith, declared himself king and gathered chariots, horsemen, and fifty men to run ahead of him. His father, King David, never questioned his actions. Adonijah was handsome and born after Absalom. He conferred with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and Abiathar the priest, who supported him. However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mighty men did not support Adonijah.

Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the stone of Zoheleth near Enrogel and invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and the men of Judah, but not Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, or his brother Solomon. Nathan spoke to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, advising her to inform King David about Adonijah's actions and remind him of his promise that Solomon would succeed him as king. Bathsheba approached the aging King David, who was being cared for by Abishag the Shunammite, and informed him of Adonijah's actions.

While Bathsheba was speaking, Nathan the prophet arrived and confirmed her words. King David then called Bathsheba back and reaffirmed his oath that Solomon would be king. He instructed Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada to anoint Solomon as king at Gihon. They followed David's orders, and Solomon was anointed king, causing great rejoicing among the people.

Adonijah and his guests heard the commotion and learned that Solomon had been made king. Fearing for his life, Adonijah sought refuge at the altar. Solomon promised not to harm him if he proved to be a worthy man. Adonijah bowed to Solomon, who then sent him home.

As David's death approached, he instructed Solomon to be strong, follow God's commands, and deal wisely with Joab and Shimei. David died after reigning for forty years, and Solomon's kingdom was firmly established. Adonijah approached Bathsheba with a request, acknowledging that the kingdom had been his but was now Solomon's.Adonijah, son of Haggith, declared himself king and gathered chariots, horsemen, and fifty men to run ahead of him.

David died after reigning for forty years, and Solomon's kingdom was firmly established. Adonijah approached Bathsheba with a request, acknowledging that the kingdom had been his but was now Solomon's.

Adonijah said to Bathsheba, "Please ask King Solomon to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife." Bathsheba agreed to speak to Solomon on his behalf. When she approached Solomon, he welcomed her and listened to her request. However, Solomon saw this as a threat to his throne and ordered Adonijah's execution. Solomon also removed Abiathar from the priesthood and ordered Joab's execution for his past crimes. Solomon then dealt with Shimei, confining him to Jerusalem and warning him that leaving the city would result in his death. When Shimei later violated this order, Solomon had him executed as well.

Solomon's kingdom was now secure. He formed an alliance with Pharaoh, king of Egypt, by marrying Pharaoh's daughter. Solomon loved the Lord and followed his father David's statutes, although he still offered sacrifices at high places. One night, God appeared to Solomon in a dream and asked what he wanted. Solomon asked for wisdom to govern his people, and God granted him unparalleled wisdom, along with riches and honor. Solomon's wisdom was soon demonstrated when he resolved a dispute between two women claiming to be the mother of the same child. His judgment impressed all of Israel, and they recognized his wisdom from God.Solomon was recognized as the king over all of Israel. He had a team of key officials: Azariah, son of Zadok, was the priest; Elihoreph and Ahiah, sons of Shisha, were scribes; Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the recorder. Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, led the army, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests. Azariah, son of Nathan, managed the officers, and Zabud, son of Nathan, was a principal officer and the king's friend. Ahishar managed the household, and Adoniram, son of Abda, oversaw the tribute.

Solomon appointed twelve officers over Israel to provide food for the king and his household, each responsible for one month of the year. Their names and regions were: the son of Hur in Mount Ephraim; the son of Dekar in Makaz, Shaalbim, Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan; the son of Hesed in Aruboth, Sochoh, and the land of Hepher; the son of Abinadab in the region of Dor, who was married to Solomon's daughter Taphath; Baana, son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and Bethshean; the son of Geber in Ramothgilead, including the towns of Jair and the region of Argob in Bashan; Ahinadab, son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; Ahimaaz in Naphtali, who married Solomon's daughter Basmath; Baanah, son of Hushai, in Asher and Aloth; Jehoshaphat, son of Paruah, in Issachar; Shimei, son of Elah, in Benjamin; and Geber, son of Uri, in Gilead, the land of Sihon and Og.

Judah and Israel were numerous, living in peace and prosperity. Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt. These kingdoms brought him gifts and served him throughout his life. Solomon's daily provisions included thirty measures of fine flour, sixty measures of meal, ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep, and various game animals. He had dominion over the region west of the Euphrates, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and enjoyed peace on all sides. The people of Judah and Israel lived safely, each under their own vine and fig tree, from Dan to Beersheba.

Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. His officers ensured that the king and his household were well-provisioned, each in their assigned month. They also provided barley and straw for the horses and camels. God granted Solomon exceptional wisdom and understanding, making him wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda. His fame spread to all the surrounding nations. Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs and composed a thousand and five songs. He discussed various topics, including trees, animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. People from all nations, including kings, came to hear Solomon's wisdom.

Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his servants to Solomon upon hearing of his anointment as king, as Hiram had always been a friend of David. Solomon sent a message to Hiram, explaining that David could not build a temple for God due to the wars surrounding him. Now that Solomon had peace, he intended to build the temple as God had promised David. Solomon requested cedar trees from Lebanon, offering to pay Hiram's servants for their work. Hiram agreed, rejoicing that God had given David a wise son to rule over Israel. Hiram provided Solomon with cedar and fir trees, and Solomon supplied Hiram with wheat and oil annually. The two kings made a peace treaty.

Solomon conscripted thirty thousand men from Israel for labor, sending ten thousand to Lebanon each month in shifts. He also had seventy thousand burden-bearers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountains, supervised by three thousand three hundred chief officers. Solomon commanded the preparation of large, costly stones for the temple's foundation. Solomon's and Hiram's builders, along with the stonecutters, prepared the materials for the temple.

In the fourth year of Solomon's reign, during the month of Ziv, he began building the temple of the Lord. The temple was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. The porch in front of the temple was twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. Solomon made narrow windows for the temple and built chambers around the walls of the temple. The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle six cubits, and the third seven cubits, with ledges around the outside to support the beams. The temple was constructed with prepared stones, so no hammer or iron tool was heard during its building. The entrance to the middle chamber was on the right side, with winding stairs leading to the upper chambers. Solomon finished the temple, covering it with cedar beams and boards. He built chambers around the temple, five cubits high, resting on the cedar beams.

God spoke to Solomon, promising to fulfill His word to David if Solomon followed His statutes and commandments. Solomon completed the temple, lining the interior with cedar boards and covering the floor with fir planks. He built a twenty-cubit section at the rear of the temple, lined with cedar, for the Most Holy Place. The main hall of the temple was forty cubits long. The interior cedar was carved with gourds and open flowers, with no stone visible. Solomon prepared the inner sanctuary to house the Ark of the Covenant.Solomon covered the entire interior of the temple with pure gold, including the cedar altar. He partitioned the inner sanctuary with gold chains and overlaid everything with gold. He also made two cherubim from olive wood, each ten cubits high, with wings spanning ten cubits. These cherubim were placed in the inner sanctuary, their wings touching the walls and each other, and they were overlaid with gold.

Solomon carved the walls with images of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and covered the floors with gold. The entrance to the inner sanctuary had doors made of olive wood, with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and flowers, all overlaid with gold. The main doors of the temple were made of fir wood, with similar carvings and gold overlay.

The inner courtyard was built with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams. The foundation of the temple was laid in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, and it was completed in the eleventh year, taking seven years to build.

Solomon also built his own palace, which took thirteen years to complete. He constructed the House of the Forest of Lebanon, which was 100 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, with cedar pillars and beams. It had three rows of windows and a porch with pillars. He also built a porch for his throne, where he would judge, covered with cedar from floor to ceiling. Solomon's own residence had a similar courtyard, and he built a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.

All these buildings were made with costly stones, cut to size and sawed on all sides, from the foundation to the coping. The great courtyard had three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams, similar to the inner courtyard of the temple and its porch.

King Solomon brought Hiram from Tyre, a skilled craftsman in brass, to work on the temple. Hiram cast two large brass pillars, each 18 cubits high, with capitals of five cubits each. He decorated the capitals with networks of chains and rows of pomegranates. The pillars were set up at the temple's porch, named Jachin and Boaz.

Hiram also made a large brass basin, called the "Sea," which was ten cubits in diameter and five cubits high, standing on twelve oxen. He crafted ten brass bases, each four cubits square and three cubits high, with intricate designs of lions, oxen, and cherubim. Each base had four brass wheels and supports.

Hiram completed all the work for Solomon, including the pillars, the Sea, the bases, and various utensils like pots, shovels, and basins, all made of bright brass. These items were cast in the plain of Jordan, between Succoth and Zarethan. Solomon did not weigh the brass items because they were too numerous.

Solomon also made all the gold vessels for the temple, including the altar, the table for the showbread, and ten gold lampstands, five on each side of the inner sanctuary.Solomon finished all the work for the temple of the Lord. He brought in the items his father David had dedicated, including silver, gold, and vessels, and placed them in the temple's treasury.

Solomon then gathered the elders of Israel, the tribal leaders, and the heads of families in Jerusalem to bring the Ark of the Covenant from the City of David (Zion). During the feast in the seventh month, all the men of Israel assembled. The priests carried the Ark, the tabernacle, and all the holy vessels. Solomon and the entire congregation offered countless sacrifices of sheep and oxen.

The priests placed the Ark in the inner sanctuary, under the wings of the cherubim, whose wings spread over the Ark. The staves of the Ark were visible from the holy place but not from outside. Inside the Ark were the two stone tablets Moses had placed there at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt.

When the priests exited the holy place, a cloud filled the temple, signifying the Lord's glory, making it impossible for the priests to continue their service. Solomon then spoke, acknowledging that the Lord had chosen to dwell in thick darkness and that he had built a permanent house for the Lord.

Solomon blessed the congregation of Israel, praising the Lord for fulfilling His promise to David. He recounted how the Lord chose David to lead Israel and how David had desired to build a temple for the Lord. However, the Lord told David that his son would build the temple. Solomon declared that he had fulfilled this promise by building the temple and placing the Ark of the Covenant there.

Solomon then prayed, acknowledging the uniqueness of the Lord and His faithfulness to His covenant. He asked the Lord to keep His promise to David, ensuring that his descendants would continue to rule Israel if they remained faithful. Solomon also prayed for the Lord to hear the prayers of the people when they faced various troubles, such as sin, defeat, drought, famine, or captivity, and to forgive and restore them.

He asked the Lord to hear the prayers of foreigners who came to the temple, so that all people would know and fear the Lord. Solomon concluded by asking the Lord to maintain the cause of His people when they went to battle and to forgive them if they sinned and repented, even in captivity. He reminded the Lord that the Israelites were His chosen people, brought out of Egypt, and asked for His continued attention to their prayers.Solomon finished praying on his knees with his hands raised to heaven. He then stood up and blessed the entire congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, "Praise the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel, just as He promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises He made through His servant Moses. May the LORD our God be with us as He was with our ancestors; may He never leave us or forsake us. May He turn our hearts to Him, to walk in all His ways and keep His commandments, statutes, and judgments, which He commanded our ancestors. May these words of mine, which I have prayed before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, so that He may uphold the cause of His servant and His people Israel as each day requires. May all the peoples of the earth know that the LORD is God; there is no other. Therefore, let your hearts be fully committed to the LORD our God, to live by His decrees and obey His commands, as at this time."

Then Solomon and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD. Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD. On that same day, the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to hold all the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings.

So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the LORD our God for seven days and seven days more, fourteen days in all. On the eighth day, he sent the people away. They blessed the king and went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the LORD had done for His servant David and His people Israel.

When Solomon had finished building the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do, the LORD appeared to him a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. The LORD said to him, "I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. As for you, if you walk before me faithfully with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws, I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.' But if you or your descendants turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them, then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. This temple will become a heap of rubble. All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?' People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why the LORD brought all this disaster on them.'"

At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings—the temple of the LORD and the royal palace—King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and juniper and gold he wanted. But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them. "What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" he asked. And he called them the Land of Kabul, a name they have to this day. Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.

Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD's temple, his own palace, the terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. (Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife. And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon, Baalath, and Tadmor in the desert, within his land, as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout all the territory he ruled.

All the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—these peoples were not Israelites—Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these people remaining in the land, whom the Israelites could not exterminate, to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day. But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers. They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon's projects—550 officials supervising those who did the work.

After Pharaoh's daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the terraces. Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense before the LORD along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations.

King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea. And Hiram sent his men—sailors who knew the sea—to serve in the fleet with Solomon's men. They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.

When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relationship to the LORD, she came to test Solomon with hard questions. Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind. Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her. When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built, the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed.

She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard. How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD's eternal love for Israel, He has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness."

And she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

(Hiram's ships brought gold from Ophir; and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood and precious stones. The king used the almugwood to make supports for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.)

King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.

The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents, not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the territories. King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield. He also made 300 small shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.King Solomon's fleet, in partnership with Hiram's navy, sailed to Tarshish every three years, bringing back gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Solomon's wealth and wisdom surpassed all other kings on earth. People from all over came to hear his wisdom, bringing gifts of silver, gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules annually.

Solomon amassed 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, stationed in chariot cities and with him in Jerusalem. He made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedar as plentiful as sycamore trees. Solomon imported horses from Egypt and linen yarn, with chariots costing 600 shekels of silver and horses 150 shekels. These were also supplied to the Hittite and Syrian kings.

However, Solomon loved many foreign women, including the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites, despite God's warning that these nations would lead the Israelites astray. Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines, who turned his heart away from God in his old age. He worshipped Ashtoreth, Milcom, Chemosh, and Molech, building high places for these gods, which angered the Lord.

God appeared to Solomon twice, commanding him not to follow other gods, but Solomon disobeyed. As a result, God decided to tear the kingdom from Solomon and give it to his servant, but not during Solomon's lifetime, for the sake of David. Instead, the kingdom would be taken from Solomon's son, leaving him with only one tribe for David's sake and for Jerusalem.

God raised adversaries against Solomon, including Hadad the Edomite, who fled to Egypt as a child and found favor with Pharaoh. Hadad returned to Edom after David and Joab's deaths. Another adversary was Rezon, who fled from Hadadezer, king of Zobah, and became king in Damascus, opposing Israel all Solomon's days.

Jeroboam, an industrious servant of Solomon, also rebelled. The prophet Ahijah told Jeroboam that God would give him ten tribes of Israel, leaving one tribe for Solomon's son for David's sake. God promised Jeroboam a lasting dynasty if he followed His commands. Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, who fled to Egypt until Solomon's death.

Solomon reigned in Jerusalem for 40 years. After his death, his son Rehoboam became king. Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel gathered to make him king. Jeroboam, still in Egypt, was called back by the Israelites. They asked Rehoboam to lighten the harsh labor and heavy yoke imposed by Solomon. Rehoboam consulted the elders, who advised him to serve the people kindly, but he rejected their counsel and sought advice from the young men he grew up with. They advised him to increase the burden, leading to further conflict.On the third day, as the king had instructed, the people returned. King Rehoboam responded harshly, ignoring the advice of the elders and following the counsel of the young men. He told the people, "My father made your burden heavy, but I will make it even heavier. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will use scorpions."

The king's refusal to listen to the people was part of God's plan, fulfilling the prophecy given by Ahijah to Jeroboam. When the Israelites saw that the king wouldn't listen, they declared, "We have no share in David, no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Look after your own house, David!" So, the Israelites went home.

Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah. When he sent Adoram, who was in charge of forced labor, the Israelites stoned him to death. Rehoboam quickly fled to Jerusalem. Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David ever since.

When the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David. Rehoboam gathered 180,000 warriors from Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to him. But God spoke to Shemaiah, a man of God, instructing him to tell Rehoboam and the people of Judah and Benjamin not to fight their fellow Israelites. They obeyed God's word and went home.

Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. He also built up Penuel. Worried that the people might return to Rehoboam if they continued to worship in Jerusalem, Jeroboam made two golden calves and told the people, "It's too much for you to go to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you out of Egypt." He placed one calf in Bethel and the other in Dan, leading the people into sin as they worshipped these idols.

Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, not just the Levites. He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, similar to the festival in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar in Bethel. He also installed priests at the high places he had made.

One day, a man of God from Judah came to Bethel by God's command. As Jeroboam stood by the altar to make an offering, the man of God cried out against the altar, prophesying that a future king named Josiah would sacrifice the priests of the high places on it and burn human bones on it. He gave a sign that the altar would split apart and its ashes would be poured out.

When King Jeroboam heard this, he stretched out his hand from the altar and ordered the man to be seized. But his hand shriveled up, and he couldn't pull it back. The altar split apart, and its ashes poured out, just as the man of God had said. Jeroboam pleaded with the man of God to pray for his hand to be restored. The man of God prayed, and the king's hand was healed.

Jeroboam invited the man of God to his home for a meal and a reward, but the man of God refused, saying he was commanded by God not to eat or drink there or return by the same way he came. So, he left by a different route.

An old prophet living in Bethel heard about the man of God's actions and went after him. He found him sitting under an oak tree and invited him to his home. The man of God initially refused, citing God's command, but the old prophet lied, claiming an angel had told him to bring the man of God back. The man of God returned with him and ate and drank at his house.

While they were eating, the word of God came to the old prophet, who then told the man of God that because he had disobeyed God's command, he would not be buried in his family's tomb. After the meal, the man of God left, but a lion met him on the road and killed him. His body lay on the road with the lion and his donkey standing beside it.

People passing by saw the body and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived. The old prophet retrieved the body, mourned for him, and buried him in his own tomb. He instructed his sons to bury him in the same tomb when he died, recognizing that the prophecy against the altar in Bethel and the high places in Samaria would come true.

Despite these events, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil ways. He continued to appoint priests for the high places from all sorts of people, leading to sin that eventually brought about the downfall of his house.Ahijah, who was now old and blind, received a message from God about Jeroboam's wife coming to ask for help for her sick son. God told Ahijah what to say to her. When she arrived, pretending to be someone else, Ahijah recognized her and delivered God's message: Jeroboam had failed to follow God's ways and had angered Him by worshipping other gods. As a result, God would bring disaster upon Jeroboam's family, leaving none of his descendants alive. The child would die as soon as she returned home, and all of Israel would mourn for him because he was the only one in Jeroboam's family who had anything good in him. God would also raise a new king to destroy Jeroboam's house and scatter Israel because of their sins.

Jeroboam's wife returned home, and as she entered the city, her child died, fulfilling Ahijah's prophecy. Jeroboam reigned for 22 years before dying, and his son Nadab succeeded him. Meanwhile, Rehoboam, Solomon's son, ruled Judah for 17 years, but the people of Judah also sinned greatly, provoking God's anger. They built high places and idols, and there were even male shrine prostitutes in the land.

In Rehoboam's fifth year, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the temple and the royal palace. Rehoboam replaced the stolen gold shields with bronze ones. Rehoboam's reign was marked by constant conflict with Jeroboam. After Rehoboam died, his son Abijam became king of Judah.

Abijam ruled for three years and continued in the sins of his father. However, for David's sake, God allowed Abijam's lineage to continue. Abijam's son Asa succeeded him and ruled Judah for 41 years. Asa did what was right in God's eyes, removing idols and shrine prostitutes from the land. He even deposed his grandmother Maachah from her position as queen mother because she had made an idol. Asa brought dedicated items into the temple and maintained a heart loyal to God throughout his life.

Asa faced ongoing conflict with Baasha, the king of Israel. Baasha fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering Asa's territory. Asa responded by sending silver and gold to Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, to break his alliance with Baasha. Ben-Hadad attacked Israel, forcing Baasha to abandon Ramah. Asa then used the materials from Ramah to build Geba and Mizpah.

Asa's reign was recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. In his old age, Asa suffered from a foot disease. After his death, his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him. Nadab, Jeroboam's son, ruled Israel for two years but continued in his father's sinful ways. Baasha conspired against Nadab, killed him, and took the throne, fulfilling Ahijah's prophecy by destroying Jeroboam's entire family. Baasha ruled Israel for 24 years but also did evil in God's sight, leading Israel into sin.God made you a leader over Israel, but you followed Jeroboam's sinful ways, leading Israel into sin and provoking God's anger. Therefore, God will destroy Baasha's family just like Jeroboam's. Those who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the fields will be eaten by birds. Baasha's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah became king.

The prophet Jehu delivered God's message against Baasha for his evil deeds and for killing Jeroboam. Elah, Baasha's son, ruled Israel for two years in Tirzah. Zimri, one of Elah's officers, conspired against him and killed him while he was drunk. Zimri then became king and killed all of Baasha's family, fulfilling God's prophecy.

Zimri ruled for seven days before the people of Israel, who were besieging Gibbethon, made Omri their king. Omri besieged Tirzah, and Zimri, seeing the city was taken, set the palace on fire and died. Omri became king and ruled for twelve years, six of which were in Tirzah. He bought the hill of Samaria and built a city there, naming it Samaria. Omri did more evil than all the kings before him, following Jeroboam's sinful ways.

Omri's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. He died and was succeeded by his son Ahab, who ruled Israel for 22 years. Ahab did more evil than any king before him, marrying Jezebel and worshipping Baal. He built an altar and a temple for Baal in Samaria and angered God more than any previous king.

During Ahab's reign, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho, fulfilling Joshua's prophecy by losing his firstborn and youngest sons. Elijah the Tishbite told Ahab that there would be no rain except by his word. God then instructed Elijah to hide by the brook Cherith, where ravens fed him. When the brook dried up, God sent Elijah to a widow in Zarephath, who provided for him despite her own scarcity. Elijah promised that her supplies would not run out until it rained again.

The widow's son later fell ill and died. Elijah prayed to God, and the boy was revived. The widow then recognized Elijah as a true man of God. After many days, God told Elijah to present himself to Ahab, promising to send rain. There was a severe famine in Samaria, and Ahab instructed Obadiah, his palace administrator who feared God, to search for grass to save their animals. Obadiah had previously hidden and fed 100 prophets from Jezebel. While searching, Obadiah met Elijah, who instructed him to tell Ahab that Elijah was there.Obadiah expressed his fear to Elijah, saying, "If I tell Ahab you're here and the Spirit of the Lord takes you away, Ahab will kill me because he won't find you. I've been faithful to the Lord since my youth. Didn't you hear how I hid 100 of the Lord's prophets from Jezebel and fed them? Now you want me to tell Ahab you're here? He'll kill me!" Elijah reassured him, "As the Lord lives, I will show myself to Ahab today."

Obadiah went to Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. When Ahab saw Elijah, he said, "Is it you, the one who troubles Israel?" Elijah replied, "I haven't troubled Israel; you and your father's house have, by abandoning the Lord's commandments and following Baal. Gather all Israel and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table, and meet me at Mount Carmel."

Ahab gathered the people and the prophets at Mount Carmel. Elijah addressed the people, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; if Baal, follow him." The people were silent. Elijah continued, "I am the only prophet of the Lord left, but Baal has 450 prophets. Let's each prepare a bull for sacrifice without setting fire to it. Call on your god, and I'll call on the Lord. The god who answers by fire is the true God." The people agreed.

The prophets of Baal prepared their bull and called on Baal from morning until noon, but there was no response. They danced around the altar they had made. At noon, Elijah mocked them, saying, "Shout louder! Maybe he's deep in thought, busy, traveling, or sleeping and needs to be awakened." They shouted louder and cut themselves with knives until they bled, but there was still no response.

Elijah then called the people to him and repaired the Lord's altar with twelve stones representing the tribes of Israel. He built an altar in the Lord's name, dug a trench around it, arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces, and laid it on the wood. He instructed them to pour water over the offering and the wood three times until the trench was filled with water.

At the time of the evening sacrifice, Elijah prayed, "Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant. Answer me, Lord, so these people will know that You are God and that You are turning their hearts back again." The fire of the Lord fell and consumed the offering, the wood, the stones, the soil, and the water in the trench. The people fell on their faces, declaring, "The Lord, He is God!"

Elijah commanded, "Seize the prophets of Baal; don't let any escape." They captured them, and Elijah took them to the Kishon Valley and killed them. Elijah then told Ahab, "Go eat and drink, for there is the sound of heavy rain." Ahab went to eat and drink, while Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground, and put his face between his knees. He told his servant to look toward the sea. The servant went and saw nothing. Elijah told him to go back seven times. On the seventh time, the servant saw a small cloud rising from the sea. Elijah told him to inform Ahab to prepare his chariot and go before the rain stops him. The sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, and heavy rain fell. Ahab rode to Jezreel, and the power of the Lord came upon Elijah, who tucked his cloak into his belt and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.

Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, including killing the prophets. Jezebel sent a message to Elijah, threatening to kill him by the next day. Elijah fled for his life to Beersheba in Judah, leaving his servant there. He went a day's journey into the wilderness, sat under a juniper tree, and prayed to die, saying, "I've had enough, Lord. Take my life; I'm no better than my ancestors." He lay down and slept under the tree. An angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat." He saw a cake of bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water. He ate and drank and lay down again. The angel returned, touched him, and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you." He ate and drank, and strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.

Elijah went into a cave and spent the night. The word of the Lord came to him, asking, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" He replied, "I've been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets. I'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me too." The Lord said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by." A great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a gentle whisper. When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and stood at the mouth of the cave. A voice asked, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" He repeated his earlier statement about being zealous for the Lord and the Israelites' actions.

The Lord told him to go back the way he came and go to the Desert of Damascus. There, he was to anoint Hazael king over Aram, Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed him as prophet. The Lord said, "Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him."

Elijah left and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing with twelve yoke of oxen. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. Elisha left the oxen and ran after Elijah, asking to kiss his father and mother goodbye before following him. Elijah told him to go back. Elisha returned, took his yoke of oxen, slaughtered them, burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat, and gave it to the people to eat. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.

Meanwhile, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army, accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots. He went up and besieged Samaria, attacking it.Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, sent messengers to Ahab, the king of Israel, demanding his silver, gold, wives, and children. Ahab agreed to the demands, but Ben-Hadad's messengers returned with an additional demand: they would search Ahab's palace and the houses of his officials, taking anything they found valuable. Ahab consulted with the elders of Israel, who advised him not to agree to these terms. Ahab then told Ben-Hadad's messengers that he would comply with the initial demands but not the additional ones.

Ben-Hadad, angered by Ahab's refusal, threatened to destroy Samaria. Ahab responded confidently, warning Ben-Hadad not to boast before the battle was over. Ben-Hadad, drinking with his allies, ordered his troops to prepare for battle. Meanwhile, a prophet approached Ahab, assuring him that the Lord would deliver the vast Aramean army into his hands to prove that He is the Lord. Ahab asked how this would happen, and the prophet explained that the young officers of the provincial commanders would lead the battle, with Ahab organizing the troops.

Ahab mustered 232 young officers and 7,000 Israelites. They launched a surprise attack at noon while Ben-Hadad and his allies were drunk. The young officers led the charge, and the Arameans fled. Ben-Hadad escaped on horseback, and the Israelites pursued and defeated the Aramean army. A prophet warned Ahab to prepare for another attack the following year.

The Aramean officials believed that Israel's gods were gods of the hills and suggested fighting on the plains, where they thought they would have the advantage. They replaced their kings with military commanders and rebuilt their army. The following year, they fought Israel at Aphek. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Israelites, with God's help, defeated the Arameans, killing 100,000 soldiers in one day. The remaining Arameans fled to Aphek, where a wall collapsed, killing 27,000 more. Ben-Hadad sought mercy from Ahab, who spared his life and made a treaty with him.

A prophet, disguised with ashes, confronted Ahab, telling a parable about a man who let a prisoner escape, resulting in his own life being forfeited. The prophet revealed his identity and declared that because Ahab had spared Ben-Hadad, Ahab's life would be taken in place of Ben-Hadad's, and his people would suffer. Ahab returned to Samaria, troubled.

Later, Ahab desired Naboth's vineyard, which was near his palace. Naboth refused to sell it, as it was his ancestral inheritance. Ahab became sullen and refused to eat. Jezebel, his wife, took matters into her own hands, writing letters in Ahab's name to the elders and nobles of Naboth's city, instructing them to falsely accuse Naboth of blasphemy and stone him to death. The elders and nobles followed Jezebel's instructions, and Naboth was killed.They took Naboth outside the city and stoned him to death. Then they informed Jezebel that Naboth was dead. Jezebel told Ahab to take possession of Naboth's vineyard since Naboth was no longer alive. Ahab went to the vineyard to claim it. 

The Lord spoke to Elijah, telling him to confront Ahab in Naboth's vineyard. Elijah told Ahab that because he had killed Naboth and taken his land, dogs would lick Ahab's blood in the same place. Ahab called Elijah his enemy, and Elijah replied that Ahab had sold himself to do evil. Elijah prophesied that disaster would come upon Ahab and his descendants, and that Jezebel would be eaten by dogs by the wall of Jezreel. 

Ahab humbled himself before the Lord, so the Lord decided not to bring disaster during Ahab's lifetime but in his son's days. 

Three years passed without war between Syria and Israel. In the third year, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, visited Ahab, king of Israel. Ahab asked Jehoshaphat to join him in reclaiming Ramoth in Gilead from the king of Syria. Jehoshaphat agreed but asked to seek the Lord's guidance first. Ahab gathered about 400 prophets who encouraged him to go to battle, but Jehoshaphat asked if there was another prophet of the Lord. Ahab mentioned Micaiah, whom he disliked because Micaiah never prophesied anything good for him. 

Micaiah was summoned and initially told Ahab to go to battle and succeed. However, Ahab insisted on the truth, and Micaiah revealed a vision of Israel scattered like sheep without a shepherd. Micaiah explained that a lying spirit had been sent to deceive Ahab's prophets. Ahab ordered Micaiah to be imprisoned until he returned safely. Micaiah declared that if Ahab returned safely, the Lord had not spoken through him.

Ahab and Jehoshaphat went to battle. Ahab disguised himself, but a random arrow struck him, and he was mortally wounded. He died that evening, and his blood was washed from his chariot, fulfilling Elijah's prophecy. 

Ahab's son Ahaziah succeeded him. Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah, following the ways of his father Asa and doing what was right in the Lord's eyes. He made peace with the king of Israel and removed the remaining male shrine prostitutes from the land. Jehoshaphat attempted to build ships for gold, but they were wrecked. Ahaziah, Ahab's son, proposed a joint venture, but Jehoshaphat refused.Jehoshaphat refused to let his servants join Ahaziah's in the ships. Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the city of David, and his son Jehoram took over as king. Ahaziah, son of Ahab, became king of Israel in Samaria during Jehoshaphat's seventeenth year as king of Judah and ruled for two years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the ways of his parents and Jeroboam, who led Israel into sin. He worshipped Baal, angering the Lord.

After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel. Ahaziah fell through a lattice in his upper room in Samaria and was injured. He sent messengers to ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, if he would recover. The angel of the Lord told Elijah to meet the messengers and ask why they were consulting Baalzebub instead of the God of Israel. Elijah told them Ahaziah would not recover and would die.

The messengers returned to Ahaziah, who asked why they came back so soon. They explained that a man had told them to return and deliver the message from the Lord. Ahaziah asked what the man looked like, and they described him as a hairy man with a leather belt. Ahaziah recognized him as Elijah.

Ahaziah sent a captain with fifty men to bring Elijah down from a hill. Elijah called down fire from heaven, which consumed the captain and his men. Ahaziah sent another captain with fifty men, and the same thing happened. The third captain begged Elijah for mercy, and the angel of the Lord told Elijah to go with him. Elijah delivered the same message to Ahaziah, who then died, fulfilling the prophecy. Jehoram succeeded him as king because Ahaziah had no son.

Elijah was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind, and Elisha succeeded him. Elisha performed miracles, including parting the Jordan River and healing the waters of Jericho. He also cursed mocking children, resulting in two bears mauling forty-two of them. Jehoram, son of Ahab, became king of Israel and did evil in the Lord's sight, though not as severely as his parents. He removed Baal's image but continued the sins of Jeroboam.

Mesha, king of Moab, rebelled against Israel after Ahab's death. Jehoram mustered Israel and sought help from Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, to fight Moab. They agreed to go through the wilderness of Edom.Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there a prophet of the Lord here so we can ask for guidance?" One of the king of Israel's servants replied, "Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who served Elijah, is here." Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the Lord is with him." So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom went to Elisha.

Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Why come to me? Go to the prophets of your parents." The king of Israel replied, "No, the Lord has called us three kings together to deliver us into the hands of Moab." Elisha responded, "As surely as the Lord lives, if it weren't for my respect for Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at you. But now, bring me a musician." As the musician played, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha, and he said, "This is what the Lord says: Make this valley full of ditches. You won't see wind or rain, but the valley will be filled with water for you, your cattle, and your animals. This is an easy thing for the Lord; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hands. You will destroy every fortified city, cut down every good tree, stop up all the wells, and ruin every good piece of land with stones."

The next morning, water flowed from Edom, filling the land. When the Moabites heard the kings were coming to fight, they gathered everyone who could wear armor and stood at the border. Early in the morning, the sun shone on the water, making it look red like blood. The Moabites thought, "The kings have fought and killed each other. Let's go take the spoils!" But when they reached the Israelite camp, the Israelites attacked and defeated them, pursuing them into their own land. They destroyed the cities, filled the fields with stones, stopped up the wells, and cut down the trees. Only Kirharaseth was left with its stones, but the slingers surrounded and attacked it.

When the king of Moab saw the battle was too fierce, he took 700 swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom but failed. In desperation, he sacrificed his eldest son on the city wall, causing great anger against Israel, and they withdrew and returned to their land.

A widow of a prophet cried out to Elisha, saying her husband was dead and a creditor was coming to take her two sons as slaves. Elisha asked what she had in her house, and she replied, "Only a pot of oil." Elisha told her to borrow many empty vessels from her neighbors, shut the door, and pour oil into all the vessels. She did so, and the oil kept flowing until all the vessels were full. Elisha then told her to sell the oil, pay her debt, and live on the rest.

Elisha often passed through Shunem, where a wealthy woman urged him to eat at her house. She told her husband, "I know this is a holy man of God. Let's make a small room for him with a bed, table, chair, and lamp so he can stay whenever he comes." One day, Elisha stayed there and asked his servant Gehazi to call the woman. Elisha asked how he could repay her kindness. She said she was content among her people. Gehazi mentioned she had no son, and her husband was old. Elisha told her she would have a son by the same time next year. She doubted but conceived and bore a son as Elisha had said.

When the child grew, he went to his father in the fields, complaining of a headache. A servant carried him to his mother, where he sat on her lap until noon and then died. She laid him on Elisha's bed, shut the door, and went to find Elisha. Her husband asked why she was going, as it wasn't a special day. She assured him it would be well. She rode quickly to Elisha at Mount Carmel. When Elisha saw her, he sent Gehazi to ask if everything was well. She said it was, but when she reached Elisha, she grabbed his feet in distress. Gehazi tried to push her away, but Elisha said to leave her alone as the Lord had hidden her trouble from him.

She asked Elisha why he had given her a son only for him to die. Elisha sent Gehazi with his staff to lay on the child's face, instructing him not to greet anyone on the way. The child's mother insisted Elisha come too. Gehazi went ahead and laid the staff on the child, but there was no response. Elisha arrived, shut the door, and prayed. He lay on the child, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands, and the child's body warmed. Elisha walked around, then repeated the process. The child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. Elisha called Gehazi to bring the mother, who fell at Elisha's feet in gratitude and took her son.

Elisha returned to Gilgal during a famine. He told his servant to make a large pot of stew for the prophets. One man gathered wild gourds, not knowing they were poisonous. As they ate, they cried out, "There is death in the pot!" Elisha added some flour, and the stew became safe to eat.

A man from Baalshalisha brought Elisha twenty loaves of barley bread and fresh grain. Elisha told his servant to give it to the people to eat. The servant doubted it would be enough for a hundred men, but Elisha insisted, saying the Lord had promised they would eat and have leftovers. The servant distributed the food, and there was plenty left over, just as the Lord had said.Naaman, a respected commander of the Syrian army, was a valiant warrior but suffered from leprosy. During a raid, the Syrians captured a young girl from Israel who became a servant to Naaman's wife. The girl suggested that Naaman visit the prophet in Samaria to be healed. Naaman informed the king of Syria, who sent a letter to the king of Israel, along with gifts of silver, gold, and clothing, requesting Naaman's healing.

The king of Israel was distressed, thinking the request was a ploy to provoke conflict. When Elisha, the prophet, heard about the king's distress, he asked for Naaman to be sent to him. Naaman arrived at Elisha's house with his entourage. Elisha sent a messenger instructing Naaman to wash in the Jordan River seven times to be healed. Naaman was initially angry, expecting a more dramatic healing process, but his servants convinced him to follow Elisha's simple instructions. Naaman did as told and was miraculously healed, his skin becoming as healthy as a child's.

Grateful, Naaman returned to Elisha, offering gifts, but Elisha refused to accept them. Naaman then asked for permission to take some earth from Israel to build an altar to the Lord, vowing to worship only the God of Israel. Elisha granted his request and sent him away in peace.

However, Gehazi, Elisha's servant, saw an opportunity for personal gain. He chased after Naaman and falsely claimed that Elisha had sent him to request silver and clothing for two visiting prophets. Naaman generously gave Gehazi more than he asked for. Gehazi hid the gifts and returned to Elisha, who confronted him. Elisha knew of Gehazi's deceit and declared that Naaman's leprosy would now cling to Gehazi and his descendants forever. Gehazi left Elisha's presence, afflicted with leprosy.

Later, the sons of the prophets told Elisha that their living quarters were too small. They proposed to build a new place by the Jordan River, and Elisha agreed to join them. While cutting wood, one of the men lost a borrowed axe head in the river. Elisha miraculously made the iron float, allowing the man to retrieve it.

Meanwhile, the king of Syria planned to attack Israel. Elisha warned the king of Israel about the Syrian ambushes, saving the Israelites multiple times. The Syrian king suspected a traitor among his ranks, but his servants revealed that Elisha, the prophet, was informing the king of Israel about their plans. The Syrian king sent a large force to capture Elisha in Dothan. Elisha's servant panicked upon seeing the enemy, but Elisha prayed for his eyes to be opened. The servant then saw the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire protecting them.

Elisha prayed for the Syrian army to be struck with blindness and led them to Samaria. Once there, Elisha prayed for their sight to be restored. The king of Israel wanted to kill the captured Syrians, but Elisha instructed him to feed them and send them back to their master. This act of kindness led the Syrian raiders to stop attacking Israel.

Later, Benhadad, the king of Syria, besieged Samaria, causing a severe famine. The situation became so dire that people resorted to cannibalism. The king of Israel, in despair, blamed Elisha and sought to kill him. Elisha, aware of the king's intentions, instructed the elders to hold the door against the king's messenger.While Elisha was still speaking, the messenger arrived and said, "This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?" Elisha responded, "Listen to the word of the LORD: By this time tomorrow, a measure of fine flour will sell for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria." A royal officer, on whom the king leaned, doubted and said, "Even if the LORD opened the windows of heaven, could this happen?" Elisha replied, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."

At the city gate, four men with leprosy discussed their dire situation. They decided to surrender to the Syrian camp, hoping for mercy. When they arrived, they found the camp deserted because the LORD had caused the Syrians to hear the sound of a great army, making them flee in panic, leaving everything behind. The lepers ate, drank, and took silver, gold, and clothes, hiding them. Realizing they should share the good news, they informed the city gatekeepers, who relayed the message to the king's household.

The king suspected a trap but sent scouts to investigate. They found the road littered with abandoned goods, confirming the Syrians' hasty retreat. The people plundered the Syrian camp, and as Elisha had prophesied, a measure of fine flour sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel. The doubting officer was trampled at the gate and died, fulfilling Elisha's prophecy.

Elisha then warned a woman, whose son he had revived, to leave because of an impending seven-year famine. She and her household stayed in Philistine territory for seven years. Upon returning, she appealed to the king for her property. Gehazi, Elisha's servant, was recounting Elisha's miracles to the king when the woman arrived. The king restored her property and the produce of her fields.

Elisha visited Damascus, where the Syrian king Benhadad was ill. Benhadad sent Hazael with gifts to ask Elisha if he would recover. Elisha told Hazael that the king would recover but would surely die. Elisha wept, foreseeing the harm Hazael would bring to Israel. Hazael denied he would do such things, but Elisha revealed he would become king of Syria. Hazael returned and reported to Benhadad, who later died under suspicious circumstances, and Hazael became king.

Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, began his reign over Judah, following the ways of Ahab's house and doing evil in the LORD's sight. Despite this, the LORD did not destroy Judah for David's sake. During his reign, Edom and Libnah revolted. Jehoram's acts are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. He was succeeded by his son Ahaziah, who also did evil, influenced by his mother Athaliah, Ahab's daughter. Ahaziah joined Joram, Ahab's son, in battle against Hazael of Syria, where Joram was wounded. Ahaziah visited the injured Joram in Jezreel.

Elisha then instructed a young prophet to anoint Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, as king over Israel. The young prophet did as told, anointing Jehu and then fleeing.Jehu approached the captains of the army and said, "I have a message for you, Captain." Jehu asked, "Which one of us?" The messenger replied, "For you, Captain." Jehu got up, went inside, and the messenger anointed him with oil, saying, "The LORD God of Israel has anointed you king over His people, Israel. You are to destroy the house of Ahab to avenge the blood of the LORD's prophets and servants shed by Jezebel. The entire house of Ahab will perish, and Jezebel will be eaten by dogs in Jezreel."

Jehu returned to his fellow officers, who asked, "Is everything alright? Why did that madman come to you?" Jehu replied, "You know the man and his talk." They insisted, "That's not true; tell us." Jehu then revealed, "He said, 'The LORD has anointed you king over Israel.'" Immediately, they laid their garments under him on the steps, blew trumpets, and proclaimed, "Jehu is king!"

Jehu conspired against Joram, who was recovering in Jezreel from wounds inflicted by the Syrians. Jehu instructed his men to ensure no one escaped to inform Jezreel. Jehu then rode to Jezreel, where Joram and Ahaziah, king of Judah, were present. A watchman saw Jehu's company approaching and reported it. Joram sent a horseman to ask, "Do you come in peace?" Jehu responded, "What do you know about peace? Fall in behind me." The watchman reported that the messenger did not return. Joram sent another horseman, who received the same response from Jehu.

Recognizing Jehu's furious driving, Joram and Ahaziah went out to meet him. Joram asked, "Do you come in peace, Jehu?" Jehu replied, "How can there be peace as long as your mother Jezebel's idolatry and witchcraft continue?" Joram turned to flee, shouting, "Treachery, Ahaziah!" Jehu shot Joram with an arrow, killing him. Jehu ordered his captain, Bidkar, to throw Joram's body into Naboth's field, fulfilling the LORD's prophecy.

Ahaziah fled but was pursued and killed by Jehu's men. His body was taken to Jerusalem and buried. Jehu then entered Jezreel, where Jezebel, having heard of his arrival, painted her face and looked out a window. She taunted Jehu, but he called out, "Who is on my side?" Two or three eunuchs looked out, and Jehu commanded, "Throw her down." They threw Jezebel out the window, and she died. Jehu ordered her burial, but only her skull, feet, and hands were found, fulfilling Elijah's prophecy that dogs would eat Jezebel's flesh.

Jehu then wrote letters to the rulers of Samaria, instructing them to behead Ahab's seventy sons and bring the heads to Jezreel. They complied, and Jehu displayed the heads at the city gate. He declared that the LORD's word against Ahab's house had been fulfilled. Jehu continued to eliminate Ahab's remaining family and supporters in Jezreel and Samaria.

Jehu then deceived the worshippers of Baal by proclaiming a grand sacrifice. He gathered all Baal's priests and followers into the temple, ensuring no servants of the LORD were present. Once inside, Jehu ordered his men to kill them all, destroying the temple and eradicating Baal worship from Israel.Jehu warned his men that if anyone let an enemy escape, they would pay with their own life. After offering a burnt sacrifice, Jehu commanded his guards and captains to kill everyone inside the temple of Baal. They did so, and then destroyed the temple and its idols, turning the site into a latrine. This marked the end of Baal worship in Israel.

However, Jehu did not completely turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had led Israel into idolatry with golden calves in Bethel and Dan. Despite this, the LORD commended Jehu for his actions against Ahab's house and promised that his descendants would rule Israel for four generations. But Jehu did not fully follow the LORD's laws, continuing in Jeroboam's sins.

During Jehu's reign, the LORD began to reduce Israel's territory, and Hazael of Syria attacked and conquered parts of Israel. Jehu's deeds and reign are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. He ruled for 28 years and was succeeded by his son Jehoahaz.

When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw her son was dead, she killed all the royal heirs. However, Jehosheba, Ahaziah's sister, hid Joash, Ahaziah's son, in the temple for six years while Athaliah ruled. In the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest organized a coup, bringing the rulers, captains, and guards to the temple. He made a covenant with them and revealed Joash, the rightful king.

Jehoiada instructed them to guard Joash and the temple. They armed themselves with King David's weapons and surrounded Joash. They crowned and anointed him king, and the people rejoiced. Athaliah, hearing the commotion, came to the temple and saw Joash. She cried out "Treason!" but Jehoiada ordered her to be taken outside and killed.

Jehoiada then renewed the covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people. They destroyed the temple of Baal and killed its priest. Jehoiada appointed officers over the LORD's temple, and Joash was brought to the king's house and placed on the throne. The people rejoiced, and the city was peaceful. Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.

In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash began his 40-year rule in Jerusalem. He did what was right in the LORD's eyes as long as Jehoiada the priest guided him. However, the high places were not removed, and people continued to offer sacrifices there.

Joash instructed the priests to use the dedicated money to repair the temple. But by the 23rd year of his reign, the repairs were not done. Joash then ordered the priests to stop collecting money and instead use it for the temple repairs. The priests agreed, and Jehoiada placed a chest in the temple to collect the money. The funds were used to pay workers who faithfully repaired the temple.

However, no silver bowls, snuffers, basins, trumpets, or other gold or silver vessels were made from the money collected. Instead, it was all used for the temple repairs. The money for trespass and sin offerings remained with the priests.

Hazael, king of Syria, attacked and captured Gath, then set his sights on Jerusalem. Joash took all the sacred items and gold from the temple and his palace and sent them to Hazael, who then withdrew from Jerusalem.

The rest of Joash's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. His servants conspired against him and killed him in the house of Millo. He was buried in the city of David, and his son Amaziah succeeded him.

In the 23rd year of Joash's reign in Judah, Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, began his 17-year reign over Israel in Samaria. He did evil in the LORD's sight, continuing in the sins of Jeroboam, which led Israel into sin. The LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of Hazael and Benhadad, Hazael's son.Jehoahaz sought the LORD's help, and the LORD listened because He saw how the king of Syria was oppressing Israel. The LORD provided a savior for Israel, allowing them to escape Syrian control and live in peace again. However, the people continued to follow the sinful ways of Jeroboam, and the sacred grove remained in Samaria. Jehoahaz was left with only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers because the king of Syria had decimated his forces.

The rest of Jehoahaz's deeds and his might are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. When he died, he was buried in Samaria, and his son Joash succeeded him. In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, began his sixteen-year reign over Israel in Samaria. He did evil in the LORD's sight, continuing the sins of Jeroboam.

The rest of Joash's acts, including his battles against Amaziah, king of Judah, are also recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. Joash died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jeroboam took the throne.

Elisha fell ill and was on his deathbed when Joash, king of Israel, visited him and wept, calling him the chariot and horsemen of Israel. Elisha instructed Joash to take a bow and arrows, place his hand on the bow, and then Elisha placed his hands on Joash's hands. Elisha told him to open the east window and shoot an arrow, declaring it the arrow of the LORD's deliverance from Syria. He then told Joash to strike the ground with the arrows. Joash struck the ground three times and stopped, which angered Elisha. He said Joash should have struck the ground five or six times to completely defeat Syria, but now he would only defeat them three times.

Elisha died and was buried. During a Moabite invasion, a man was hastily buried in Elisha's tomb, and upon touching Elisha's bones, the man revived and stood up. Hazael, king of Syria, oppressed Israel throughout Jehoahaz's reign, but the LORD was gracious and compassionate because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not destroy Israel or cast them from His presence.

Hazael died, and his son Benhadad succeeded him. Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, recaptured the cities taken by Benhadad from his father through three victories.

In the second year of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, began his twenty-nine-year reign in Jerusalem. He did what was right in the LORD's eyes, like his father Joash, but did not remove the high places where people continued to offer sacrifices. Once his rule was secure, he executed the servants who had killed his father but spared their children, following the law of Moses.

Amaziah defeated ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Selah, renaming it Joktheel. He then challenged Jehoash, king of Israel, to face him. Jehoash warned Amaziah to stay home and not seek trouble, but Amaziah insisted. They met in battle at Bethshemesh, where Judah was defeated, and Jehoash captured Amaziah. Jehoash broke down Jerusalem's wall and took all the gold, silver, and treasures from the temple and the king's house, along with hostages, and returned to Samaria.

The rest of Jehoash's acts, including his battles with Amaziah, are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. Jehoash died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jeroboam succeeded him. Amaziah lived fifteen years after Jehoash's death. His deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. A conspiracy against him in Jerusalem forced him to flee to Lachish, where he was killed. He was buried in Jerusalem, and his son Azariah, at sixteen years old, was made king. Azariah rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah.

In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, Jeroboam, son of Joash, began his forty-one-year reign over Israel in Samaria. He did evil in the LORD's sight, continuing the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat. He restored Israel's borders from Hamath to the Dead Sea, fulfilling the word of the LORD spoken through Jonah, son of Amittai. The LORD saw Israel's suffering and saved them through Jeroboam, not wanting to erase their name from under heaven.

The rest of Jeroboam's acts, including his wars and the recovery of Damascus and Hamath for Israel, are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. Jeroboam died and was succeeded by his son Zachariah.

In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, Azariah, son of Amaziah, began his fifty-two-year reign in Jerusalem. He did what was right in the LORD's eyes, like his father Amaziah, but did not remove the high places. The LORD struck him with leprosy, and he lived in isolation while his son Jotham governed the land. Azariah's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. He died and was buried in the city of David, and his son Jotham succeeded him.

In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah, Zachariah, son of Jeroboam, began his six-month reign over Israel in Samaria. He did evil in the LORD's sight, continuing the sins of Jeroboam. Shallum, son of Jabesh, conspired against and killed him, taking the throne. Zachariah's acts are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel, fulfilling the LORD's word that Jeroboam's descendants would rule for four generations.In the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah, king of Judah, Shallum, son of Jabesh, began his reign over Israel in Samaria, but it lasted only a month. Menahem, son of Gadi, came from Tirzah to Samaria, killed Shallum, and took over the throne. The rest of Shallum's deeds and his conspiracy are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

Menahem attacked Tiphsah and its surrounding areas because they did not open their gates to him. He brutally killed all the inhabitants, including pregnant women. Menahem ruled Israel for ten years, starting in the thirty-ninth year of Azariah, king of Judah. He continued the sinful practices of Jeroboam, son of Nebat.

When Pul, king of Assyria, invaded the land, Menahem paid him a thousand talents of silver to secure his support and maintain his rule. Menahem collected this money from the wealthy men of Israel, each contributing fifty shekels of silver. Pul then withdrew from the land. The rest of Menahem's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. After his death, his son Pekahiah succeeded him.

In the fiftieth year of Azariah, king of Judah, Pekahiah, son of Menahem, began his two-year reign over Israel in Samaria. He continued the sinful ways of Jeroboam. Pekah, son of Remaliah, one of his captains, conspired against him and killed him in the palace, along with Argob and Arieh, and fifty men from Gilead. Pekah then took over the throne. The rest of Pekahiah's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

In the fifty-second year of Azariah, king of Judah, Pekah, son of Remaliah, began his twenty-year reign over Israel in Samaria. He continued the sinful practices of Jeroboam. During his reign, Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria, captured several cities and regions, including Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all of Naphtali, and took the inhabitants to Assyria. Hoshea, son of Elah, conspired against Pekah, killed him, and took over the throne in the twentieth year of Jotham, son of Uzziah. The rest of Pekah's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

In the second year of Pekah, son of Remaliah, Jotham, son of Uzziah, began his sixteen-year reign over Judah in Jerusalem. He was twenty-five years old when he became king. His mother was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok. Jotham did what was right in the LORD's eyes, following the example of his father Uzziah, but he did not remove the high places where people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense. He built the upper gate of the LORD's temple. The rest of Jotham's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. During his reign, the LORD began to send Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, against Judah. Jotham died and was buried in the city of David, and his son Ahaz succeeded him.

In the seventeenth year of Pekah, son of Remaliah, Ahaz, son of Jotham, began his sixteen-year reign over Judah in Jerusalem. He was twenty years old when he became king. Unlike his ancestor David, Ahaz did not do what was right in the LORD's eyes. He followed the practices of the kings of Israel, even sacrificing his son in the fire, imitating the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.

Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem but could not conquer it. Rezin recovered Elath for Syria, driving out the Jews, and the Syrians settled there. Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria, asking for help against the kings of Syria and Israel. Ahaz took silver and gold from the LORD's temple and the royal treasury and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria, who responded by attacking Damascus, capturing it, and killing Rezin. Ahaz then went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser and saw an altar there. He sent a model and detailed plans of the altar to Uriah the priest, who built it before Ahaz returned. When Ahaz came back, he offered sacrifices on the new altar and moved the bronze altar from its place in front of the LORD's temple to the north side of the new altar. He commanded Uriah to use the new altar for all the regular offerings and sacrifices, while the bronze altar would be for his personal inquiries. Uriah followed the king's orders.

Ahaz also removed the side panels and basins from the movable stands and took down the bronze sea from the bronze oxen it stood on, placing it on a stone base. He made these changes to appease the king of Assyria. The rest of Ahaz's deeds are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. Ahaz died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, and his son Hezekiah succeeded him.

In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea, son of Elah, began his nine-year reign over Israel in Samaria. He did evil in the LORD's eyes, but not like the kings of Israel before him. Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, attacked Hoshea, who became his vassal and paid him tribute. However, the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was conspiring with So, king of Egypt, and had stopped paying tribute. Shalmaneser imprisoned Hoshea and besieged Samaria for three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria, settling them in Halah, Habor, and the cities of the Medes.The Israelites turned away from the LORD, ignoring His laws and covenant. They followed worthless idols and adopted the practices of the surrounding nations, which the LORD had forbidden. They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD, made idols, and worshipped celestial bodies and Baal. They even sacrificed their children in fire, practiced divination, and engaged in sorcery, provoking the LORD's anger. As a result, the LORD removed Israel from His presence, leaving only the tribe of Judah.

Judah also failed to keep the LORD's commandments, following the sinful practices of Israel. Consequently, the LORD rejected all of Israel's descendants, allowing them to be plundered and exiled. This happened because they had made Jeroboam king, who led Israel into great sin. The Israelites continued in Jeroboam's sins until the LORD removed them from His sight, as foretold by His prophets. The Israelites were taken to Assyria, where they remain to this day.

The king of Assyria brought people from various regions to settle in Samaria, replacing the Israelites. These new inhabitants did not fear the LORD, so He sent lions among them, killing some. They informed the king of Assyria, who sent one of the exiled priests back to teach them how to worship the LORD. However, each group continued to make their own gods and worship them in high places.

Despite learning about the LORD, these people continued to worship their own gods, following the customs of the nations from which they came. They did not follow the LORD's statutes, ordinances, or commandments given to the children of Jacob, whom He named Israel. The LORD had made a covenant with them, instructing them not to fear or worship other gods, but to worship Him alone, who brought them out of Egypt. They were to observe His laws and commandments forever. However, they did not listen and continued their previous practices, fearing the LORD but also serving their own idols. This behavior persisted through generations.

In the third year of Hoshea, king of Israel, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, began his reign over Judah. He was twenty-five years old and reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abi, daughter of Zechariah. Hezekiah did what was right in the LORD's eyes, following the example of his ancestor David. He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke into pieces the bronze serpent Moses had made, which the Israelites had been burning incense to, calling it Nehushtan. Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, and there was no king like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after him. He remained faithful to the LORD, keeping His commandments, and the LORD was with him, making him successful in everything he did. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him. He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory.

In Hezekiah's fourth year, which was the seventh year of Hoshea, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, attacked Samaria and besieged it. After three years, Samaria was captured in Hezekiah's sixth year, which was Hoshea's ninth year. The king of Assyria deported the Israelites to Assyria because they had not obeyed the LORD's commands and had violated His covenant.

In Hezekiah's fourteenth year, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked and captured all the fortified cities of Judah. Hezekiah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish, admitting his wrongdoing and agreeing to pay whatever was demanded. The king of Assyria imposed a tribute of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. Hezekiah gave him all the silver found in the LORD's temple and the royal treasury. He even stripped the gold from the doors and pillars of the temple to pay the king of Assyria.

The king of Assyria then sent his officials with a large army to Jerusalem. They stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool and called for the king. Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah went out to meet them. The Assyrian official, Rabshakeh, questioned their confidence and mocked their reliance on Egypt and the LORD. He claimed that the LORD had sent him to destroy the land. Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah asked him to speak in Aramaic, not Hebrew, so the people on the wall would not understand. But Rabshakeh insisted on speaking in Hebrew, loudly proclaiming that the king of Assyria would not save them and urging them not to trust Hezekiah's promises of deliverance by the LORD."Make a deal with me and come out, and you will each eat from your own vine and fig tree, and drink water from your own cistern. Until I come and take you to a land like your own, a land of grain and wine, bread and vineyards, olive oil, and honey, so you may live and not die. Don't listen to Hezekiah when he says, 'The LORD will deliver us.' Have any of the gods of the nations saved their lands from the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? Did they save Samaria from my hand? Who among all the gods of these countries has saved their land from me, that the LORD should save Jerusalem?"

But the people remained silent and did not answer, as the king had commanded. Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported Rabshakeh's words.

When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the temple of the LORD. He sent Eliakim, Shebna, and the elders of the priests, all in sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah. They told him, "This is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace. It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke him. Therefore, pray for the remnant that still survives."

Isaiah replied, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard, those words with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own country, and I will have him cut down with the sword there.'"

Rabshakeh returned to find the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, having heard that he had left Lachish. When he heard that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, was coming to fight against him, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this message: "Do not let the God you depend on deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria. You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, destroying them completely. Will you be delivered? Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them? Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?"

Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, read it, and went up to the temple of the LORD. He spread it out before the LORD and prayed, "LORD, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Give ear, LORD, and hear; open your eyes, LORD, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God. It is true, LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands. They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. Now, LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, LORD, are God."

Then Isaiah sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria. This is the word the LORD has spoken against him: 'The Virgin Daughter Zion despises you and mocks you. Daughter Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee. Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel! By your messengers you have ridiculed the Lord. And you have said, "With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its junipers. I have reached its remotest parts, the finest of its forests. I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet, I have dried up all the streams of Egypt."

Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old, I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone. Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up. But I know where you are and when you come and go and how you rage against me. Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.'

This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above. For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.

Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: 'He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with a shield or build a siege ramp against it. By the way that he came, he will return; he will not enter this city,' declares the LORD. 'I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.'"

That night, the angel of the LORD went out and put to death 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies! So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.

One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.

In those days, Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, "This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover." Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, "Remember, LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him: "Go back and tell Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now, you will go up to the temple of the LORD. I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.'"

Then Isaiah said, "Prepare a poultice of figs." They did so and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.

Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the LORD on the third day from now?"

Isaiah answered, "This is the LORD's sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?"

"It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps," said Hezekiah. "Rather, have it go back ten steps."

Then the prophet Isaiah called on the LORD, and the LORD made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.

At that time, Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift because he had heard of Hezekiah's illness. Hezekiah received the envoys and showed them all that was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine olive oil—his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.

Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did those men say, and where did they come from?"

"From a distant land," Hezekiah replied. "They came from Babylon."

The prophet asked, "What did they see in your palace?"

"They saw everything in my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."Isaiah told Hezekiah, "Listen to what the LORD says: 'The time is coming when everything in your palace, all the treasures stored up by your ancestors, will be taken to Babylon. Nothing will be left. Some of your descendants will be taken away and made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"

Hezekiah responded, "The word of the LORD you have spoken is good." He thought, "At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime."

The rest of Hezekiah's deeds, his achievements, and how he built a pool and a tunnel to bring water into the city, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh succeeded him as king.

Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed, set up altars for Baal, made an Asherah pole, and worshiped all the starry hosts. He built altars in the temple of the LORD, where the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem I will put my Name." In both courts of the temple, he built altars to the starry hosts. He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced divination, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.

Manasseh also placed a carved Asherah pole in the temple, of which the LORD had said to David and Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. I will not again make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their ancestors, if they will only be careful to do everything I commanded them and keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them." But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray, so they did more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.

The LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying, "Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins, doing more evil than the Amorites who preceded him, and has led Judah into sin with his idols, I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle. I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hands of their enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their foes because they have done evil in my eyes and have aroused my anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until now."

Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end—besides the sin he had caused Judah to commit, so they did evil in the eyes of the LORD. The rest of Manasseh's deeds, including his sins, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. Manasseh died and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. His son Amon succeeded him as king.

Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled for two years in Jerusalem. His mother was Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. He followed the ways of his father, worshiping the idols his father had worshiped and forsaking the LORD, the God of his ancestors. Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. But the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place. The rest of Amon's deeds are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah succeeded him as king.

Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he ruled for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah from Boscath. He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and followed completely the ways of his ancestor David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.

In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the temple of the LORD. He said, "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people. Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the LORD—the carpenters, the builders, and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple. But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are honest in their dealings."

Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: "Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple." Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.

When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes. He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Akbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's attendant: "Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD's anger that burns against us because those who have gone before us have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us."

Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter. She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me, 'This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people, according to everything written in the book the king of Judah has read. Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all the idols their hands have made, my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.' Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard: Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people—that they would become a curse and be laid waste—and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have also heard you, declares the LORD. Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'"

So they took her answer back to the king. Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. He went up to the temple of the LORD with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, and the prophets—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD—to follow the LORD and keep his commands, statutes, and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.

The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank, and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel. He did away with the idolatrous priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and those around Jerusalem—those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations, and to all the starry hosts.Josiah removed all the priests from the cities of Judah and desecrated the high places where they had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the high places at the gates of the city, including those at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city. Although the priests of these high places did not serve at the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they still ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.

Josiah defiled Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom to prevent anyone from sacrificing their children to Molech. He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun and burned the chariots of the sun. He demolished the altars on the roof of Ahaz's upper chamber and the altars Manasseh had made in the temple courts, throwing their debris into the Kidron Valley.

He also desecrated the high places east of Jerusalem, which Solomon had built for Ashtoreth, Chemosh, and Milcom. Josiah smashed the sacred stones, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their sites with human bones. He destroyed the altar at Bethel and the high place built by Jeroboam, burning the high place and grinding it to powder.

As Josiah looked around, he noticed tombs on the hillside. He had the bones removed and burned on the altar to defile it, fulfilling the prophecy of the man of God. When he asked about a particular tomb, he was told it belonged to the prophet who had foretold these events. Josiah ordered that the prophet's bones be left undisturbed.

Josiah also removed all the shrines in the towns of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had built to provoke the LORD. He executed the priests of these high places and burned human bones on their altars before returning to Jerusalem.

Josiah then commanded the people to celebrate the Passover as written in the Book of the Covenant. This Passover was unlike any observed since the days of the judges or the kings of Israel and Judah. In his eighteenth year, Josiah celebrated this Passover in Jerusalem.

Josiah also eradicated mediums, wizards, idols, and all other abominations in Judah and Jerusalem to fulfill the words of the law found by Hilkiah the priest. No king before or after Josiah turned to the LORD with all his heart, soul, and strength, as he did, following the law of Moses.

Despite Josiah's reforms, the LORD's fierce anger against Judah remained due to the provocations of Manasseh. The LORD declared that He would remove Judah from His sight, just as He had removed Israel, and reject Jerusalem and the temple.

The rest of Josiah's acts are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. During his reign, Pharaoh Necho of Egypt went to assist the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. Josiah confronted him at Megiddo, where he was killed. His servants brought his body back to Jerusalem for burial. The people then anointed Josiah's son Jehoahaz as king.

Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, but he reigned only three months in Jerusalem. He did evil in the sight of the LORD, following the ways of his ancestors. Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath and imposed a tribute on the land. Necho then made Eliakim, Josiah's son, king and changed his name to Jehoiakim, taking Jehoahaz to Egypt, where he died.

Jehoiakim taxed the land to pay the tribute to Pharaoh. He was twenty-five years old when he became king and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem, doing evil in the sight of the LORD. During his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, invaded, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years before rebelling.

The LORD sent raiders from various nations to destroy Judah, fulfilling His word through the prophets. This was due to the sins of Manasseh and the innocent blood he shed, which the LORD would not forgive. The rest of Jehoiakim's acts are recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. He died, and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him.

During Jehoiachin's reign, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem. Jehoiachin, his family, and his officials surrendered, and Nebuchadnezzar took them captive. He also took all the treasures from the temple and the royal palace, as well as the skilled workers and soldiers, leaving only the poorest people behind. Nebuchadnezzar made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king and changed his name to Zedekiah.In the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his army besieged Jerusalem. The siege lasted until the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign. By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city was severe, and there was no food for the people. The city walls were breached, and the soldiers fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, even though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. The Chaldean army pursued King Zedekiah and captured him in the plains of Jericho, scattering his troops.

They brought Zedekiah to King Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah, where he was judged. Zedekiah's sons were killed before his eyes, and then his eyes were put out. He was bound in bronze chains and taken to Babylon.

On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, arrived in Jerusalem. He burned down the temple of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses in Jerusalem. The Chaldean army, under his command, tore down the city walls. Nebuzaradan took the remaining people in the city, including those who had defected to the Babylonians, and the rest of the population, into exile. However, he left some of the poorest people behind to tend the vineyards and fields.

The Chaldeans broke apart the bronze pillars, the bronze sea, and the stands in the temple of the LORD and took the bronze to Babylon. They also took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in temple service. The captain of the guard took away the firepans and bowls, which were made of gold and silver. The bronze from the two pillars, the sea, and the stands, which Solomon had made for the temple, was too heavy to be weighed. Each pillar was eighteen cubits high, with a bronze capital three cubits high, decorated with a network and pomegranates.

Nebuzaradan also took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. From the city, he took an officer in charge of the fighting men, five royal advisors, the army commander’s secretary who conscripted the people, and sixty other men found in the city. Nebuzaradan brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they were executed. Thus, Judah was taken into exile.

Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the remaining people in Judah. When the army officers and their men heard about this, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Gedaliah assured them and their men not to be afraid of serving the Babylonians and to settle in the land and serve the king of Babylon, promising that it would go well for them. However, in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, along with ten men, assassinated Gedaliah and the Jews and Babylonians with him at Mizpah. Fearing the Babylonians, all the people, from the least to the greatest, fled to Egypt.

In the thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's exile, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, Evil-Merodach, king of Babylon, released Jehoiachin from prison. He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings in Babylon. Jehoiachin changed out of his prison clothes and dined regularly at the king's table for the rest of his life. The king provided Jehoiachin with a daily allowance for the rest of his life.

Eshek, Azel's brother, had three sons: Ulam, Jehush, and Eliphelet. Ulam's sons were known as brave warriors and skilled archers, having many descendants—150 in total. These were the descendants of Benjamin.

All of Israel was recorded in genealogies, which were documented in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. These records included those who were exiled to Babylon due to their unfaithfulness. The first inhabitants to return to their cities were the Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants.

In Jerusalem, people from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived. Among them were Uthai, son of Ammihud, and Asaiah, the firstborn of the Shilonites. From the sons of Zerah, there were Jeuel and 690 of their relatives. From the sons of Benjamin, there were Sallu, Ibneiah, Elah, and Meshullam, along with 956 of their relatives, who were heads of their families.

The priests included Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, and Azariah, who was the ruler of the house of God. Other priests were Adaiah and Maasiai, along with 1,760 of their relatives, who were capable men for the service of the house of God.

The Levites included Shemaiah, Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, Mattaniah, Obadiah, and Berechiah. The gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their relatives, with Shallum as the chief. They were responsible for guarding the gates of the tabernacle, a duty passed down from their ancestors.

Phinehas, son of Eleazar, had been their leader in the past, and the Lord was with him. Zechariah, son of Meshelemiah, was the gatekeeper of the tabernacle's entrance. In total, 212 gatekeepers were chosen by genealogy and appointed by David and Samuel the seer. They and their descendants were responsible for guarding the gates of the house of the Lord.

The gatekeepers were stationed in four directions: east, west, north, and south. Their relatives from the villages would join them every seven days. The four chief gatekeepers were in charge of the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. They stayed around the house of God because they were responsible for opening it every morning.

Some Levites were in charge of the temple's utensils, ensuring they were brought in and out as needed. Others oversaw the sanctuary's instruments, fine flour, wine, oil, incense, and spices. Some of the priests' sons made the ointment for the spices. Mattithiah, a Levite and firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for the items made in pans. Other Kohathites were in charge of preparing the showbread every Sabbath.

The singers, who were heads of the Levite families, stayed in the temple chambers and were exempt from other duties because they were employed in their work day and night. These heads of the Levite families lived in Jerusalem.

In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, and his wife Maachah. Their firstborn son was Abdon, followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. Mikloth fathered Shimeam. They also lived with their relatives in Jerusalem.

Ner fathered Kish, who fathered Saul. Saul's sons were Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal. Jonathan's son was Meribbaal, who fathered Micah. Micah's sons were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. Ahaz fathered Jarah, who fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. Zimri fathered Moza, who fathered Binea. Binea's descendants included Rephaiah, Eleasah, and Azel. Azel had six sons: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.

The Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled, falling slain on Mount Gilboa. The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons, killing Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. The battle was intense, and Saul was critically wounded by archers. He asked his armor-bearer to kill him to avoid capture, but the armor-bearer refused. So, Saul took his own sword and fell on it. When the armor-bearer saw Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. Thus, Saul, his three sons, and his entire household died together.

When the Israelites in the valley saw that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and the Philistines occupied them. The next day, the Philistines came to strip the dead and found Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa. They took Saul's head and armor and sent them throughout Philistia to proclaim the news to their idols and people. They placed his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, all their valiant men retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons, brought them to Jabesh, buried their bones under an oak tree, and fasted for seven days. Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord, disobeyed His word, and consulted a medium for guidance instead of seeking the Lord. Therefore, the Lord put him to death and gave the kingdom to David, son of Jesse.

All Israel gathered to David at Hebron, acknowledging that he was their own flesh and blood. They recalled that even when Saul was king, David led Israel in battle, and the Lord had said David would shepherd His people and become their ruler. So, the elders of Israel came to David at Hebron, and he made a covenant with them before the Lord. They anointed David as king over Israel, as the Lord had promised through Samuel.

David and all Israel then went to Jerusalem, also known as Jebus, where the Jebusites lived. The Jebusites taunted David, saying he could not enter their city. However, David captured the fortress of Zion, which became the City of David. David declared that whoever led the attack on the Jebusites would become the chief and commander. Joab, son of Zeruiah, led the charge and became the chief. David took up residence in the fortress, and it was called the City of David. He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding area, while Joab restored the rest of the city. David became more and more powerful because the Lord Almighty was with him.

These were the leaders of David's mighty warriors, who supported him in his kingdom and helped him become king, as the Lord had promised concerning Israel. The chief of David's mighty warriors was Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, who used his spear to kill 300 men in one encounter. Next was Eleazar, son of Dodo.Eleazar, the Ahohite, was one of David's three mighty warriors. He stood with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines gathered for battle. The field was full of barley, and the Israelites fled from the Philistines. But Eleazar and David took a stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and defeated the Philistines. The Lord granted them a great victory.

Three of the thirty chief warriors went down to David at the cave of Adullam while the Philistine army was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. At that time, David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. David expressed a longing for water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem. The three warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well, and brought it back to David. However, David refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the Lord, saying, "God forbid that I should drink this water. It represents the blood of these men who risked their lives to bring it to me." So, he did not drink it. These were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.

Abishai, the brother of Joab, was the chief of the three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the three. He was doubly honored above the three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.

Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down Moab's two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. Additionally, he struck down an Egyptian who was five cubits tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear. These were the exploits of Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, who was as famous as the three mighty warriors. He was held in greater honor than any of the thirty, but he was not included among the three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

Other valiant warriors included Asahel, the brother of Joab; Elhanan, son of Dodo from Bethlehem; Shammoth the Harorite; Helez the Pelonite; Ira, son of Ikkesh from Tekoa; Abiezer from Anathoth; Sibbecai the Hushathite; Ilai the Ahohite; Maharai the Netophathite; Heled, son of Baanah the Netophathite; Ithai, son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin; Benaiah the Pirathonite; Hurai from the ravines of Gaash; Abiel the Arbathite; Azmaveth the Baharumite; Eliahba the Shaalbonite; the sons of Hashem the Gizonite; Jonathan, son of Shage the Hararite; Ahiam, son of Sacar the Hararite; Eliphal, son of Ur; Hepher the Mecherathite; Ahijah the Pelonite; Hezro the Carmelite; Naarai, son of Ezbai; Joel, the brother of Nathan; Mibhar, son of Hagri; Zelek the Ammonite; Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab, son of Zeruiah; Ira the Ithrite; Gareb the Ithrite; Uriah the Hittite; Zabad, son of Ahlai; Adina, son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty with him; Hanan, son of Maachah; Joshaphat the Mithnite; Uzzia the Ashterathite; Shama and Jehiel, the sons of Hothan the Aroerite; Jediael, son of Shimri, and his brother Joha the Tizite; Eliel the Mahavite; Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam; Ithmah the Moabite; Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.

These are the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was hiding from Saul, son of Kish. They were among the warriors who helped him in battle. They were armed with bows and could use both their right and left hands to sling stones and shoot arrows. They were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin. The chief was Ahiezer, followed by Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the thirty and a leader over the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Josabad the Gederathite; Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite; Elkanah; Jesiah; Azarel; Joezer; Jashobeam the Korahite; and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.

From the tribe of Gad, some brave warriors joined David at his stronghold in the wilderness. They were experienced soldiers, skilled with shield and spear, whose faces were as fierce as lions and as swift as gazelles on the mountains. Ezer was the chief, followed by Obadiah, Eliab, Mishmannah, Jeremiah, Attai, Eliel, Johanan, Elzabad, Jeremiah, and Machbannai. These Gadites were army commanders; the least of them was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand. They crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing its banks and chased away all who lived in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.

Some men from Benjamin and Judah also came to David at his stronghold. David went out to meet them and said, "If you have come to me in peace to help me, I am ready to welcome you. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies, even though I have done no wrong, may the God of our ancestors see it and judge you." Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said, "We are yours, David! We are with you, son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to those who help you, for your God helps you." So, David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.

Some men from the tribe of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. However, they did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers sent David away, fearing he would turn against them and rejoin Saul. When David went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zilthai, leaders of thousands in Manasseh. They helped David against raiding bands, for they were all brave warriors, and they became commanders in his army. Day after day, men came to help David until he had a great army, like the army of God.

These are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to him, as the Lord had said. From Judah, carrying shield and spear, there were 6,800 armed for battle. From Simeon, warriors ready for battle, 7,100. From Levi, 4,600, including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, with 3,700 men, and Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 officers from his family. From Benjamin, Saul's tribe, 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul's house until then. From Ephraim, brave warriors, famous in their own clans, 20,800. From half the tribe of Manasseh, designated by name to come and make David king, 18,000. From Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, 200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command. From Zebulun, experienced soldiers prepared for battle with every type of weapon, 50,000, who were loyal to David. From Naphtali, 1,000 officers, together with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears. From Dan, ready for battle, 28,600. From Asher, experienced soldiers prepared for battle, 40,000. And from the east side of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, armed with every type of weapon, 120,000.

All these warriors, armed for battle, came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king. They spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their families had supplied provisions for them. Also, their neighbors from as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. There were plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, olive oil, cattle, and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.

David consulted with the commanders of thousands and hundreds and with every leader. He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the Lord our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our people throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join us. Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul." The whole assembly agreed to do this because it seemed right to all the people. So, David assembled all Israel.David and all of Israel went to Baalah (Kirjathjearim) in Judah to bring the Ark of God, which is called by the name of the Lord who dwells between the cherubim. They transported the Ark on a new cart from Abinadab's house, with Uzza and Ahio guiding it. David and all of Israel celebrated with all their might before God, with songs, harps, lyres, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.

When they reached the threshing floor of Chidon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzza reached out to steady the Ark. The Lord's anger burned against Uzza for his irreverence, and he struck him down, and Uzza died there before God. David was upset because the Lord's wrath had broken out against Uzza, and he named that place Perez Uzza. David was also afraid of God that day and wondered how he could bring the Ark to himself. So, he did not take the Ark to the City of David but instead took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. The Ark stayed there for three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-Edom's household and everything he had.

King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons to build a palace for him. David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel. David took more wives in Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters. The names of his children born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.

When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they went up in full force to search for him. David heard about it and went out to meet them. The Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. David inquired of God, asking if he should attack the Philistines and if God would deliver them into his hands. The Lord answered, "Go, I will deliver them into your hands." So, David and his men went to Baal Perazim, where he defeated them. David said, "God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a breakthrough of water." So, they named that place Baal Perazim. The Philistines abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.

Once again, the Philistines raided the valley. David inquired of God again, and God told him not to go straight up but to circle around and attack them in front of the balsam trees. God said, "When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army." David did as God commanded, and they struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer. David's fame spread throughout every land, and the Lord made all the nations fear him.

David built houses for himself in the City of David and prepared a place for the Ark of God, pitching a tent for it. He said that only the Levites should carry the Ark of God because the Lord had chosen them to carry it and to minister before Him forever. David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Lord to the place he had prepared for it. He gathered the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: from the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 relatives; from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 relatives; from the Gershomites, Joel the chief and 130 relatives; from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief and 200 relatives; from the Hebronites, Eliel the chief and 80 relatives; and from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief and 112 relatives.

David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. He said to them, "You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the Ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it. Because you did not carry it the first time, the Lord our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of Him about how to do it in the prescribed way." So, the priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord, the God of Israel. The Levites carried the Ark of God with poles on their shoulders, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the Lord.

David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their fellow Levites as musicians to make a joyful sound with musical instruments: lyres, harps, and cymbals. So, the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah; and with them their relatives of the second rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.

The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the lyres according to Alamoth; and Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play the harps, directing according to Sheminith. Kenaniah, the head Levite, was in charge of the singing; that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it. Berechiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the Ark. Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were to blow trumpets before the Ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the Ark.

So, David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-Edom, with rejoicing. Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed. David was wearing a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the Ark, and as were the musicians and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod. So, all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with shouts, the sound of rams' horns, trumpets, and cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.

As the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. When she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart. They brought the Ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God. After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins to each Israelite man and woman.

David appointed some of the Levites to minister before the Ark of the Lord, to extol, thank, and praise the Lord, the God of Israel. Asaph was the chief, and next to him in rank were Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They were to play the lyres and harps, Asaph was to sound the cymbals, and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the Ark of the Covenant of God. 

That day, David first appointed Asaph and his associates to give praise to the Lord in this manner:

"Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done. Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts. Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice. Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always. Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced, you his servants, the descendants of Israel, his chosen ones, the children of Jacob. He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth. He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made, for a thousand generations, the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac. He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant: 'To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.' When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it, they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another. He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake, he rebuked kings: 'Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.' Sing to the Lord, all the earth; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples. For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods."All the gods of other nations are just idols, but the LORD created the heavens. Glory and honor are in His presence; strength and joy are in His place. Give to the LORD, families of nations, give to the LORD glory and strength. Give to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness. Tremble before Him, all the earth! The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved. Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns!" Let the sea resound, and everything in it; let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them. Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth. Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His love endures forever. Cry out, "Save us, God of our salvation; gather us and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name and glory in Your praise." Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. And all the people said, "Amen," and praised the LORD.

David left Asaph and his associates before the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD to minister there regularly, according to each day's requirements. He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to serve there. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were gatekeepers. David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon to present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the Law of the LORD, which He had given Israel. With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, "for His love endures forever." Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.

Then all the people left, each for their own home, and David returned home to bless his household.

After this, David settled in his palace and said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD is under a tent." Nathan replied to David, "Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you."

But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying, "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in. I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another. Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'

"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth. And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies.

"'I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you: When your days are over and you go to be with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor. I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.'"

Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.

Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said: "Who am I, LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far? And as if this were not enough in your sight, my God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You, LORD God, have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men.

"What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant, LORD. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.

"There is no one like you, LORD, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears. And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt? You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, LORD, have become their God.

"And now, LORD, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established forever. Do as you promised, so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, 'The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, is Israel's God!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.

"You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you. You, LORD, are God! You have promised these good things to your servant. Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever."

In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its surrounding villages from the control of the Philistines. David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to him and brought him tribute. Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah in the vicinity of Hamath, when he went to set up his monument at the Euphrates River. David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.

When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them. He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought him tribute. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.

David took the gold shields carried by the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. From Tebah and Kun, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, David took a great quantity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles.

When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold, silver, and bronze. King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, as he had done with the silver and gold he had taken from all these nations: Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek.

Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.

David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people. Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was secretary; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were chief officials at the king's side.

In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king. David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.

When David's envoys came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him, the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Haven't his envoys come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?" So Hanun seized David's envoys, shaved them, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away.

When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."

When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maakah, and Zobah.The Ammonites hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maachah with his people. They camped near Medeba, and the Ammonites gathered from their cities to prepare for battle. When David heard about this, he sent Joab and his elite troops. The Ammonites positioned themselves at the city gate, while the allied kings were in the field.

Seeing the battle lines against him, Joab chose the best troops of Israel to face the Syrians, while the rest, led by his brother Abishai, faced the Ammonites. Joab told Abishai, "If the Syrians are too strong for me, help me; if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll help you. Be courageous and fight for our people and the cities of our God. Let the LORD do what is good in His sight."

Joab and his troops advanced against the Syrians, who fled. When the Ammonites saw the Syrians retreat, they also fled before Abishai and entered the city. Joab then returned to Jerusalem.

The Syrians regrouped and brought reinforcements from beyond the river, led by Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army. David was informed and gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and set up battle lines against the Syrians. The Syrians fought but fled before Israel. David killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, including Shophach. The remaining servants of Hadadezer made peace with David and became his subjects, and the Syrians no longer helped the Ammonites.

The following spring, Joab led the army to ravage the Ammonite territory and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab captured Rabbah and took the crown from their king, which weighed a talent of gold and was adorned with precious stones. David placed it on his head and took a large amount of plunder from the city. He also brought out the people and put them to work with saws, iron tools, and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite cities and then returned to Jerusalem with his people.

Later, there was another war with the Philistines at Gezer, where Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, subduing them. Another battle with the Philistines saw Elhanan, son of Jair, kill Lahmi, the brother of Goliath, whose spear was as large as a weaver's beam. Yet another battle at Gath involved a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, who defied Israel but was killed by Jonathan, son of Shimea, David's brother. These giants were defeated by David and his servants.

Satan incited David to take a census of Israel. David instructed Joab and the leaders to count the people from Beersheba to Dan. Joab questioned the need, but David insisted. Joab reported the count: 1.1 million men in Israel and 470,000 in Judah, excluding Levi and Benjamin, as Joab found the king's command detestable. God was displeased and struck Israel. David confessed his sin and asked for forgiveness.

God sent the prophet Gad to offer David three choices: three years of famine, three months of defeat by enemies, or three days of plague. David chose to fall into God's hands, trusting His mercy. The LORD sent a plague, killing 70,000 Israelites. As an angel was about to destroy Jerusalem, God relented and stopped the angel at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. David and the elders, in sackcloth, pleaded with God, asking for the punishment to fall on David and his family instead of the people.

God instructed Gad to tell David to build an altar on Ornan's threshing floor. David bought the site for 600 shekels of gold and built an altar, offering sacrifices. The LORD answered with fire from heaven, and the angel sheathed his sword. David continued to offer sacrifices there, as he was afraid to go to the tabernacle at Gibeon due to the angel's sword.

David declared the site as the house of the LORD and the altar for Israel. He gathered materials and workers to build the temple, preparing iron, bronze, and cedar in abundance. David charged his son Solomon to build the temple, explaining that he couldn't do it himself due to the bloodshed in his reign. He assured Solomon that God had chosen him to build the temple and that he would have peace and rest from his enemies.David continued, "My son Solomon will be a man of peace, and I will give him rest from all his enemies. His name will be Solomon, and I will grant peace and quiet to Israel during his reign. He will build a house for my name, and he will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish his kingdom over Israel forever. Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and help you build the house of the LORD your God, as He has promised. May the LORD give you wisdom and understanding to lead Israel and to follow His laws. You will prosper if you carefully obey the statutes and judgments the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or discouraged.

I have worked hard to prepare for the house of the LORD, gathering 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and an abundance of bronze and iron. I have also collected timber and stone, and you can add to these materials. You have many skilled workers, including stonecutters, carpenters, and craftsmen of all kinds. The gold, silver, bronze, and iron are beyond measure. Get to work, and may the LORD be with you."

David also instructed all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon, saying, "The LORD your God is with you and has given you peace on every side. He has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me, and the land is subdued before the LORD and His people. Now, dedicate yourselves to seeking the LORD your God. Get up and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that the ark of the covenant and the holy vessels of God can be brought into the house built for the name of the LORD."

When David was old and nearing the end of his life, he made Solomon king over Israel. He gathered all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and Levites. The Levites, aged thirty and above, were counted, totaling 38,000 men. Of these, 24,000 were assigned to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, 6,000 were officers and judges, 4,000 were gatekeepers, and 4,000 praised the LORD with musical instruments that David had made for worship.

David organized the Levites into divisions based on their family lines: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. The descendants of Gershon included Laadan and Shimei. Laadan's sons were Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel. Shimei's sons were Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran. The descendants of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Amram's sons were Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart to handle the most sacred duties, including offering incense and blessings in the name of the LORD forever. Moses' sons were Gershom and Eliezer. Gershom's son was Shebuel, and Eliezer's son was Rehabiah. Izhar's son was Shelomith. Hebron's sons were Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam. Uzziel's sons were Micah and Jesiah. Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. Mahli's sons were Eleazar and Kish. Eleazar had no sons, only daughters, who married their cousins, the sons of Kish. Mushi's sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.

These were the descendants of Levi, listed by their families, who served in the house of the LORD from the age of twenty and above. David said, "The LORD God of Israel has given rest to His people, and they will dwell in Jerusalem forever. The Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle or its vessels for service." By David's last instructions, the Levites were counted from the age of twenty and above. Their duties included assisting the descendants of Aaron in the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts and rooms, and in the purification of all holy things. They were responsible for the bread of the Presence, the fine flour for grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements and sizes. They were to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise in the evening. They were to offer all burnt sacrifices to the LORD on the Sabbaths, new moons, and appointed festivals, according to the number required by the regulations. They were to serve continually before the LORD and take care of the tabernacle and the holy place, and assist their fellow descendants of Aaron in the service of the house of the LORD.

David also organized the descendants of Aaron into divisions. Aaron's sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. David, along with Zadok from Eleazar's descendants and Ahimelech from Ithamar's descendants, divided them according to their appointed duties. There were more leaders among Eleazar's descendants than Ithamar's, so they were divided accordingly: sixteen leaders from Eleazar's family and eight from Ithamar's family. They were assigned duties by lot, with both families having equal representation in the service of the sanctuary and the house of God. Shemaiah, a Levite scribe, recorded their names in the presence of the king, the leaders, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites. The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. These divisions served in the house of the LORD according to the regulations established by their ancestor Aaron, as commanded by the LORD God of Israel.

The remaining descendants of Levi were also organized: Shubael from Amram's descendants, Jehdeiah from Shubael's descendants, Isshiah from Rehabiah's descendants, Shelomith from Izhar's descendants, Jahath from Shelomith's descendants, Jeriah from Hebron's descendants, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. Micah from Uzziel's descendants, Shamir from Micah's descendants, Zechariah from Isshiah's descendants, Mahli and Mushi from Merari's descendants, and Jaaziah's descendants: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. Eleazar, a descendant of Mahli, had no sons, only daughters, who married their cousins, the sons of Kish. Jerahmeel was the son of Kish. Mushi's descendants were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the Levites listed by their families, who served in the house of the LORD.

David and the leaders of the army set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying with harps, lyres, and cymbals. The list of those who performed this service included the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the king's supervision. The sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six in all, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the harp, giving thanks and praise to the LORD. The sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. All these were the sons of Heman, the king's seer, who were given to him through the promises of God to exalt him. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.All these musicians served under their fathers' direction for the music in the house of the LORD, using cymbals, harps, and lyres, as ordered by the king. There were 288 skilled musicians in total. They cast lots for their duties, regardless of age or skill level. The first lot fell to Joseph, the second to Gedaliah, the third to Zaccur, and so on, each group consisting of twelve members.

Regarding the gatekeepers: Meshelemiah, a Korhite, had seven sons: Zechariah, Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel, Elam, Jehohanan, and Elioenai. Obed-Edom had eight sons: Shemaiah, Jehozabad, Joah, Sacar, Nethaneel, Ammiel, Issachar, and Peulthai, all blessed by God. Shemaiah's sons were Othni, Rephael, Obed, Elzabad, Elihu, and Semachiah, all strong men. In total, Obed-Edom's family had 62 capable men. Meshelemiah's family had 18 strong men. Hosah, from the Merari clan, had four sons: Simri, Hilkiah, Tebaliah, and Zechariah, totaling 13 men.

These gatekeepers were assigned to their posts by lot, with equal representation for each family. The east gate was assigned to Shelemiah, the north gate to Zechariah, the south gate to Obed-Edom, and the west gate to Shuppim and Hosah. Each gate had a specific number of guards assigned daily.

Ahijah was in charge of the treasures of the house of God. The Gershonite clan, led by Jehieli, managed the treasures. Shebuel, a descendant of Moses, was the chief treasurer. Other treasurers included Rehabiah, Jeshaiah, Joram, Zichri, and Shelomith. They managed the dedicated treasures from battles and offerings made by Samuel, Saul, Abner, Joab, and others.

The Izharites, led by Chenaniah, were responsible for external affairs and served as officers and judges. The Hebronites, led by Hashabiah, managed the LORD's work and the king's service west of the Jordan. Jerijah led the Hebronites in Gilead, where they found 2,700 capable men who were appointed as leaders over the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh.

David organized the Israelites into divisions, each serving the king monthly. Each division had 24,000 men. The first division was led by Jashobeam, the second by Dodai, the third by Benaiah, the fourth by Asahel, the fifth by Shamhuth, the sixth by Ira, the seventh by Helez, the eighth by Sibbecai, the ninth by Abiezer, the tenth by Maharai, the eleventh by Benaiah, and the twelfth by Heldai.

David also appointed leaders over the tribes of Israel: Eliezer for Reuben, Shephatiah for Simeon, Hashabiah for Levi, Zadok for Aaron, Elihu for Judah, Omri for Issachar, Ishmaiah for Zebulun, Jerimoth for Naphtali, Hoshea for Ephraim, Joel for the half-tribe of Manasseh, Iddo for the other half-tribe in Gilead, Jaasiel for Benjamin, and Azareel for Dan.

David did not count those under twenty years old, as the LORD promised to increase Israel's population. Joab began a census but did not finish due to God's wrath, and the final count was not recorded in King David's chronicles. Azmaveth was in charge of the king's treasuries.Jehonathan, son of Uzziah, was in charge of the storehouses in the fields, cities, villages, and castles. Ezri, son of Chelub, oversaw the workers in the fields. Shimei the Ramathite managed the vineyards, and Zabdi the Shiphmite handled the wine cellars. Baalhanan the Gederite was responsible for the olive and sycamore trees in the lowlands, while Joash managed the oil cellars. Shitrai the Sharonite took care of the herds in Sharon, and Shaphat, son of Adlai, managed the herds in the valleys. Obil the Ishmaelite was in charge of the camels, Jehdeiah the Meronothite managed the donkeys, and Jaziz the Hagerite oversaw the flocks. These were the officials in charge of King David's property.

Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe. Jehiel, son of Hachmoni, was with the king's sons. Ahithophel was the king's counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion. After Ahithophel, Jehoiada, son of Benaiah, and Abiathar took over. Joab was the general of the king's army.

David gathered all the leaders of Israel, including the tribal princes, captains of the divisions serving the king, captains over thousands and hundreds, stewards of the king's property, officers, mighty men, and valiant men, in Jerusalem. David stood up and addressed them, expressing his desire to build a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant and a footstool for God. However, God told him he could not build it because he was a man of war and had shed blood. Instead, God chose David's son Solomon to build the house and its courts, promising to establish Solomon's kingdom if he followed God's commandments.

David urged Solomon and the people to seek and keep God's commandments to inherit the land and pass it on to future generations. He advised Solomon to serve God with a perfect heart and willing mind, as God understands all thoughts and intentions. If Solomon sought God, he would find Him, but if he forsook God, he would be cast off forever. David encouraged Solomon to be strong and build the sanctuary, assuring him that God would be with him until the work was completed.

David provided Solomon with detailed plans for the temple, including the porch, houses, treasuries, upper chambers, inner parlors, and the mercy seat. He also gave instructions for the priests, Levites, and all the vessels of service. David provided gold and silver by weight for various items, including candlesticks, lamps, tables, flesh hooks, bowls, cups, basins, and the altar of incense. He explained that God had given him these plans in writing.

David encouraged Solomon to be strong and courageous, assuring him that God would not fail or forsake him until the work was finished. He reminded Solomon that the priests, Levites, skilled workers, and all the people would support him.

David then addressed the congregation, acknowledging that Solomon was young and the work was great because the palace was for God, not man. He had prepared materials for the temple, including gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, onyx stones, and other precious stones. David also gave from his own wealth, contributing gold and silver for the temple. He asked who else was willing to consecrate their service to God.

The leaders of Israel, including the tribal princes, captains, and rulers, willingly offered gold, silver, brass, iron, and precious stones for the temple. The people rejoiced because they offered willingly with perfect hearts, and David also rejoiced.

David blessed God before the congregation, praising His greatness, power, glory, victory, and majesty. He acknowledged that everything comes from God and that they were only giving back what was already His. David prayed for God to keep the people's hearts devoted to Him and to give Solomon a perfect heart to keep God's commandments and build the temple.

David instructed the congregation to bless God, and they did so, bowing their heads and worshipping the Lord and the king. The next day, they offered numerous sacrifices and burnt offerings to God, celebrating with great joy. They also confirmed Solomon as king.Solomon was anointed as king for the second time, and Zadok was appointed as the priest. Solomon then took his place on the throne of the Lord, succeeding his father David, and prospered as all of Israel obeyed him. All the princes, mighty men, and David's sons pledged their allegiance to Solomon. The Lord greatly exalted Solomon, giving him a royal majesty unmatched by any previous king in Israel.

David, son of Jesse, reigned over Israel for forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. He died at an old age, full of days, riches, and honor, and Solomon succeeded him as king. The acts of King David, from beginning to end, are recorded in the books of Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer, detailing his reign, his might, and the events that affected him and Israel.

Solomon, strengthened in his kingdom, was blessed by the Lord his God. He spoke to all of Israel's leaders, including captains, judges, and governors. Solomon and the congregation went to the high place at Gibeon, where the tabernacle of God, made by Moses, was located. David had brought the Ark of God to Jerusalem, where he had prepared a tent for it. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the bronze altar before the tabernacle.

That night, God appeared to Solomon and asked what he desired. Solomon requested wisdom and knowledge to lead the vast people of Israel. God granted Solomon wisdom and knowledge, and also promised him riches, wealth, and honor greater than any king before or after him.

Solomon returned to Jerusalem and reigned over Israel. He amassed chariots and horsemen, making silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedar trees as plentiful as sycamore trees. Solomon imported horses and chariots from Egypt, trading them with the kings of the Hittites and Syria.

Solomon decided to build a temple for the Lord and a palace for his kingdom. He assigned 70,000 men to carry burdens, 80,000 to quarry stone, and 3,600 to oversee the work. Solomon requested cedar, fir, and algum trees from Huram, king of Tyre, who had previously supplied materials to David. Solomon promised to provide wheat, barley, wine, and oil for Huram's servants in return.

Huram praised the Lord for giving David a wise son to build the temple and the kingdom. He sent a skilled craftsman, Huram-Abi, to work with Solomon's craftsmen. Solomon provided the necessary materials and began building the temple on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to David. The construction started in the second month of the fourth year of Solomon's reign.

The temple's dimensions were sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. The porch in front of the temple was twenty cubits wide and 120 cubits high, overlaid with pure gold. The main hall was paneled with fir and overlaid with fine gold, decorated with palm trees and chains. Precious stones adorned the temple, and the gold used was from Parvaim. The beams, posts, walls, and doors were overlaid with gold, and cherubim were carved on the walls.

In the most holy place, Solomon made two cherubim of image work, overlaid with gold. Their wings spanned twenty cubits, touching the walls and each other. The veil of the temple was made of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, with cherubim embroidered on it. Solomon also made two pillars, each thirty-five cubits high, with five-cubit capitals on top, adorned with chains.Solomon decorated the temple pillars with red pomegranates on chains. He set up two pillars at the temple entrance, naming the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz. He made a bronze altar, 20 cubits long and wide, and 10 cubits high. He also created a large bronze basin, 10 cubits in diameter and 5 cubits high, decorated with oxen figures. This basin, supported by twelve oxen facing different directions, held 3,000 baths of water.

Solomon made ten smaller basins, placing five on each side of the temple for washing offerings, while the large basin was for the priests. He crafted ten gold lampstands, placing five on each side of the temple, and ten tables, also five on each side. He made 100 gold basins. The priests' courtyard and the great courtyard had doors overlaid with bronze, and the large basin was positioned on the southeast side.

Huram made various items for the temple, including pots, shovels, and basins, all from bright brass. These were cast in the Jordan plain between Succoth and Zeredathah. Solomon made many vessels, including a golden altar, tables for the showbread, gold lampstands, and various gold utensils. The temple doors, including those to the most holy place, were also covered in gold.

Once all the work was completed, Solomon brought in the items his father David had dedicated, placing the silver, gold, and other instruments in the temple treasury. Solomon then gathered Israel's elders and tribal leaders in Jerusalem to bring the Ark of the Covenant from the City of David. During the seventh month festival, the Levites carried the Ark, the tabernacle, and all holy vessels to the temple. Solomon and the congregation offered countless sacrifices.

The priests placed the Ark in the most holy place under the cherubim's wings. The cherubim's wings covered the Ark and its poles, which were visible from the holy place but not from outside. The Ark contained only the two tablets Moses had placed there at Horeb. When the priests left the holy place, they and the Levite singers, dressed in white linen and playing instruments, praised the Lord. As they sang, the temple filled with a cloud, symbolizing the Lord's glory, making it impossible for the priests to continue their service.

Solomon then addressed the congregation, blessing them and praising the Lord for fulfilling His promise to David. He recounted how God chose Jerusalem and David, and how David had desired to build a temple for the Lord. However, God had chosen Solomon to complete this task. Solomon declared that he had built the temple for the Lord and placed the Ark of the Covenant inside.

Solomon stood before the altar, spread his hands toward heaven, and prayed, acknowledging God's uniqueness and faithfulness. He asked God to keep His promise to David, ensuring that his descendants would continue to rule Israel if they followed God's laws. Solomon questioned whether God would truly dwell on earth, given that even the heavens couldn't contain Him, and asked God to listen to the prayers made in the temple and to forgive His people. He prayed for justice and mercy, asking God to hear and respond to the prayers of the people of Israel.When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. The priests couldn't enter the temple because of the overwhelming presence of the Lord's glory. All the Israelites saw the fire and the glory of the Lord and bowed down, worshipping and praising Him, saying, "He is good; His mercy endures forever."

King Solomon and all the people offered sacrifices to the Lord. Solomon sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep, dedicating the temple. The priests performed their duties, and the Levites, with musical instruments made by King David, praised the Lord, saying, "His mercy endures forever." The priests blew trumpets, and all Israel stood.

Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the temple because the bronze altar he had made couldn't hold all the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. Solomon and all Israel celebrated the festival for seven days, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt. On the eighth day, they held a solemn assembly, having dedicated the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for another seven days. On the 23rd day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people home, joyful and glad for the goodness the Lord had shown to David, Solomon, and His people Israel.

Solomon completed the temple and his royal palace, successfully carrying out all he had planned to do in the temple and his own house. The Lord appeared to Solomon at night, saying, "I have heard your prayer and chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices. If I shut up the heavens so there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land, or send a plague among my people, if my people, who are called by my name, humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land. My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.

As for you, if you walk before me faithfully as David your father did, and do all I command, observing my decrees and laws, I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David, saying, 'You shall never fail to have a successor to rule over Israel.' But if you turn away and forsake the decrees and commands I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them, then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. This temple will become a heap of rubble. All who pass by will be appalled and say, 'Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple?' People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshipping and serving them—that is why he brought all this disaster on them.'"

After twenty years, during which Solomon built the temple of the Lord and his own palace, he rebuilt the cities Huram had given him and settled Israelites in them. Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and captured it. He built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath. He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and gates and bars, as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and horses—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout all the territory he ruled.

All the people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not Israelites, Solomon conscripted for slave labor, as they are to this day. But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers. They were also King Solomon's chief officials—250 officials supervising the men.

Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the Lord has entered are holy."

On the altar of the Lord that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord, according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three annual festivals—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles. Following the regulations of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered.The Levites and priests followed King David's instructions, performing their duties daily. They didn't deviate from the king's orders regarding the priests, Levites, or the temple treasures. Solomon's work on the Lord's temple was completed from its foundation to its finish, making it perfect.

Solomon then traveled to Ezion-Geber and Eloth by the sea in Edom. Huram sent ships and experienced sailors to help Solomon's servants travel to Ophir, where they obtained 450 talents of gold and brought it back to King Solomon.

When the Queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she visited him in Jerusalem with a large entourage, bringing spices, gold, and precious stones. She tested Solomon with difficult questions, and he answered them all. Impressed by his wisdom, the palace he built, the food at his table, the organization of his officials, and the way they served, she was left in awe.

The Queen of Sheba acknowledged that Solomon's wisdom and prosperity exceeded the reports she had heard. She praised the Lord for placing Solomon on the throne to rule with justice. She gave Solomon 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones, unmatched by any other.

Huram's and Solomon's servants also brought gold from Ophir, algum wood, and precious stones. Solomon used the algum wood to make terraces for the Lord's temple and the royal palace, as well as harps and lyres for musicians, which were unique in Judah.

Solomon gave the Queen of Sheba everything she desired, in addition to what she had brought him. She then returned to her land with her servants.

Each year, Solomon received 666 talents of gold, excluding what traders and merchants brought. Kings of Arabia and regional governors also brought gold and silver to Solomon. He made 200 large shields and 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, placing them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.

Solomon crafted a great ivory throne overlaid with pure gold, with six steps, a gold footstool, armrests, and two lions standing beside the armrests. Twelve lions stood on the six steps, unmatched by any other kingdom. All of Solomon's drinking vessels and the vessels in the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold, as silver was considered of little value during his reign.

Solomon's fleet, in partnership with Huram's servants, traveled to Tarshish every three years, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. Kings from around the world sought his presence to hear the wisdom God had given him, bringing annual gifts of silver, gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules.

Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots and 12,000 horsemen, stationed in chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt. He made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedar as plentiful as sycamore trees in the lowlands. Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and all other lands.

The rest of Solomon's acts, from beginning to end, are recorded in the writings of Nathan the prophet, Ahijah the Shilonite's prophecy, and the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat. Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years. When he died, he was buried in the city of David, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him.

Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had gathered to make him king. Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had fled to Egypt to escape Solomon, returned when he heard the news. The people, led by Jeroboam, asked Rehoboam to lighten the harsh labor and heavy yoke imposed by his father, promising to serve him if he did.

Rehoboam asked for three days to consider their request. He consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon, who advised him to be kind and speak gently to the people, ensuring their loyalty. However, Rehoboam rejected their advice and consulted the young men he had grown up with, who advised him to increase the burden on the people, saying his little finger was thicker than his father's waist and that he would chastise them with scorpions instead of whips.

When Jeroboam and the people returned on the third day, Rehoboam harshly rejected their request, following the young men's advice. This decision, influenced by God to fulfill Ahijah's prophecy, led to Israel's rebellion against the house of David. The people declared they had no share in David's lineage and returned to their homes, leaving Rehoboam to rule only over the Israelites in Judah.

Rehoboam sent Hadoram, in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem, and Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David ever since. Rehoboam gathered 180,000 warriors from Judah and Benjamin to fight Israel and restore his rule, but God, through Shemaiah the man of God, commanded them not to fight their brothers, and they obeyed, returning home.

Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and fortified cities in Judah, including Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth-Zur, Soco, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. He strengthened these strongholds, placing captains and supplies of food, oil, and wine in each city, ensuring their security.The Levites left their towns and properties to move to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had stopped them from serving as priests for the Lord. Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places, idols, and golden calves he had made. People from all the tribes of Israel who were devoted to seeking the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord, the God of their ancestors. This strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, Solomon's son, strong for three years, as they followed the ways of David and Solomon.

Rehoboam married Mahalath, the daughter of David's son Jerimoth, and Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, Jesse's son. They had children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham. Later, he married Maachah, the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. Rehoboam loved Maachah more than all his other wives and concubines, having eighteen wives and sixty concubines, fathering twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. He appointed Maachah's son Abijah as the chief prince, intending to make him king. Rehoboam wisely distributed his sons throughout the fortified cities of Judah and Benjamin, providing them with ample provisions and seeking many wives for them.

When Rehoboam had established and strengthened his kingdom, he abandoned the law of the Lord, and all Israel followed his lead. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem because they had been unfaithful to the Lord. Shishak came with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and countless troops from Egypt, including Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites. He captured the fortified cities of Judah and advanced to Jerusalem.

The prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah, who had gathered in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said, "This is what the Lord says: 'You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.'" The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The Lord is just." When the Lord saw their humility, he spoke to Shemaiah, saying, "Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will grant them some deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak. However, they will become his subjects, so they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands."

Shishak attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and the royal palace, including the gold shields Solomon had made. Rehoboam replaced them with bronze shields and assigned them to the commanders of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace. Whenever the king went to the Lord's temple, the guards would bring out the shields and then return them to the guardroom. Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the Lord's anger turned away from him, and he was not completely destroyed. Conditions in Judah improved.

Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and ruled for seventeen years. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in the city the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother was Naamah, an Ammonite. Rehoboam did evil because he did not set his heart on seeking the Lord. The events of Rehoboam's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in the writings of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer concerning genealogies. There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. Rehoboam died and was buried in the city of David, and his son Abijah succeeded him.

In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam's reign, Abijah became king of Judah. He ruled in Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. Abijah went into battle with 400,000 valiant warriors, while Jeroboam confronted him with 800,000 able fighters. Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and addressed Jeroboam and all Israel, reminding them that the Lord had given the kingdom of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt. He accused Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and a servant of Solomon, of rebelling against his master and gathering worthless scoundrels to oppose Rehoboam when he was young and inexperienced.

Abijah warned that they were now challenging the kingdom of the Lord, led by David's descendants, and that they had brought golden calves as gods. He reminded them that they had expelled the Lord's priests, the descendants of Aaron and the Levites, and appointed their own priests like the pagan nations. In contrast, Abijah and his people had not forsaken the Lord. The priests of the Lord, descendants of Aaron, and the Levites continued their duties, offering burnt sacrifices and incense, arranging the showbread, and lighting the golden lampstand every evening. They kept the charge of the Lord, while Israel had abandoned him. Abijah declared that God was with them as their leader, and his priests were ready to sound the trumpets against Israel. He warned them not to fight against the Lord, the God of their ancestors, as they would not succeed.

Meanwhile, Jeroboam had sent troops to ambush Judah from behind, so the battle was in front and behind them. Judah cried out to the Lord, and the priests blew their trumpets. The men of Judah raised a battle cry, and as they shouted, God struck down Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. The Israelites fled, and God delivered them into Judah's hands. Abijah and his army inflicted heavy casualties, killing 500,000 of Israel's chosen men. The Israelites were subdued, and Judah prevailed because they relied on the Lord, the God of their ancestors. Abijah pursued Jeroboam, capturing cities including Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their surrounding villages. Jeroboam never regained power during Abijah's lifetime, and the Lord struck him down, and he died.

Abijah grew strong, married fourteen wives, and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. The rest of Abijah's deeds, his ways, and his sayings are recorded in the story of the prophet Iddo. Abijah died and was buried in the city of David, and his son Asa succeeded him. During Asa's reign, the land experienced ten years of peace. Asa did what was right and good in the eyes of the Lord his God. He removed the foreign altars and high places, smashed the sacred stones, and cut down the Asherah poles. He commanded Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and to obey his laws and commands. He removed the high places and incense altars from all the towns of Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under him.

Asa built up the fortified cities of Judah during this time of peace, as no one was at war with him. The Lord had given him rest. He said to Judah, "Let us build these towns and put walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the Lord our God; we sought him, and he has given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered. Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin, armed with small shields and bows. All these were brave fighting men.

Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with a vast army and 300 chariots and came as far as Mareshah. Asa went out to meet him, and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah. Asa called to the Lord his God, saying, "Lord, there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, Lord our God, for we rely on you, and in your name, we have come against this vast army. Lord, you are our God; do not let mere mortals prevail against you." The Lord struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled, and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. The Cushites were crushed and could not recover; they were shattered before the Lord and his forces.Asa and his army carried away a lot of loot from the defeated cities around Gerar. They also took livestock, including sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem. 

The Spirit of God came upon Azariah, son of Oded, who went to meet Asa. He told Asa and all of Judah and Benjamin that the Lord would be with them as long as they sought Him, but if they abandoned Him, He would abandon them. For a long time, Israel had been without the true God, a teaching priest, or the law. But when they turned to the Lord in their distress, He was found by them. During those times, there was no peace for those who went out or came in, as there were great troubles on all the inhabitants of the lands. Nations and cities were destroyed because God troubled them with adversity. Azariah encouraged them to be strong and not to give up, for their work would be rewarded.

When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded, he took courage. He removed the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the Lord in front of the temple. Asa gathered all of Judah and Benjamin, along with people from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them, for many had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him. They assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign. They sacrificed to the Lord 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep from the plunder they had brought back. They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul. Anyone who would not seek the Lord was to be put to death, regardless of age or gender. They took an oath to the Lord with loud acclamation, shouting, trumpets, and horns. All of Judah rejoiced at the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly, and He was found by them, giving them rest on every side.

Asa also removed his grandmother Maachah from her position as queen mother because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley. Although he did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa's heart was fully committed to the Lord all his life. He brought into the temple of God the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated. There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.

In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasha, king of Israel, attacked Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering Asa's territory. Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Lord's temple and his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad, king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus. He asked Ben-Hadad to break his treaty with Baasha so that Baasha would withdraw from him. Ben-Hadad agreed and sent his commanders against the towns of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work. Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With these materials, he built up Geba and Mizpah.

At that time, Hanani the seer came to Asa, king of Judah, and said, "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand. Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the Lord, He delivered them into your hand. For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war." Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time, Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.

The events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the Lord but only from the physicians. Then in the forty-first year of his reign, Asa died and rested with his ancestors. They buried him in the tomb he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.

Jehoshaphat, Asa's son, succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel. He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured. The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his ancestor David and did not consult the Baals. He sought the God of his father and followed His commands rather than the practices of Israel. The Lord established the kingdom under his control, and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so he had great wealth and honor. His heart was devoted to the ways of the Lord; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.

In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials to teach in the towns of Judah. With them were certain Levites and priests. They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the Lord; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people. The fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so they did not go to war against Jehoshaphat. Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats. Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem. Their enrollment by families was as follows: from Judah, commanders of units of 1,000; Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men; next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000; next, Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered himself for the service of the Lord, with 200,000. From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields; next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle. These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.

Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. Some years later, he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead. Ahab, king of Israel, asked Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, "Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war." But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the Lord." So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—400 men—and asked them, "Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for God will give it into the king's hand." But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?" The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say such a thing," Jehoshaphat replied. So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."The prophets continued to encourage the king, saying, "Go to Ramoth Gilead and succeed; the Lord will give it into the king's hand." The messenger who went to summon Micaiah told him, "All the other prophets are promising success to the king. Let your words agree with theirs and speak favorably." But Micaiah replied, "As surely as the Lord lives, I will say only what my God tells me."

When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or should I refrain?" Micaiah answered, "Attack and be victorious, for they will be given into your hand." The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?" Then Micaiah said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the Lord said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"

The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?" Micaiah continued, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing on his right and on his left. And the Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' One suggested this, and another that. Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.' 'By what means?' the Lord asked. 'I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. 'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the Lord. 'Go and do it.'

"So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you." Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked. Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."

The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son, and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'" Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"

So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.

Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel." When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him. God drew them away from him, for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.

But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told the chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded." The battle raged all day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset, he died.

Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem. Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Because of this, the wrath of the Lord is upon you. However, there is some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God."

Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the Lord, the God of their ancestors. He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah. He told them, "Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for mere mortals but for the Lord, who is with you whenever you give a verdict. Now let the fear of the Lord be on you. Judge carefully, for with the Lord our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery."

In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests, and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the Lord and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem. He gave them these orders: "You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the Lord. In every case that comes before you from your people who live in the cities—whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees, or regulations—you are to warn them not to sin against the Lord; otherwise, his wrath will come on you and your people. Do this, and you will not sin.

"Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the Lord, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in any matter concerning the king. And the Levites will serve as officials before you. Act with courage, and may the Lord be with those who do well."

After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat. Some people came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from the other side of the Dead Sea. It is already in Hazezon Tamar" (that is, En Gedi). Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah. The people of Judah came together to seek help from the Lord; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him.

Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the Lord in front of the new courtyard and said: "Lord, the God of our ancestors, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you. Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend? They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying, 'If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.'

"But now here are men from Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them. See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance. Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you."

All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the Lord. Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly. He said: "Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the Lord says to you: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God's. Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel. You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the Lord will be with you.'"

Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the Lord. Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.

Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the Lord your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful." After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the Lord and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: "Give thanks to the Lord, for his love endures forever."

As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated. The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.When the people of Judah reached the watchtower in the wilderness, they saw the enemy's dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had survived. Jehoshaphat and his people collected a vast amount of riches and precious jewels from the fallen, more than they could carry. It took them three days to gather all the spoils because there was so much. On the fourth day, they assembled in the Valley of Berachah and blessed the Lord, which is why the place is called the Valley of Berachah to this day.

They returned to Jerusalem with joy, led by Jehoshaphat, because the Lord had given them victory over their enemies. They entered Jerusalem with musical instruments, praising the Lord. The surrounding kingdoms were in awe when they heard that the Lord had fought against Israel's enemies, and Jehoshaphat's kingdom was at peace because God had given him rest on all sides.

Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah for 25 years, starting at the age of 35. His mother was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi. He followed the ways of his father Asa and did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, although the high places were not removed, and the people had not fully committed their hearts to God.

The rest of Jehoshaphat's deeds are recorded in the book of Jehu son of Hanani, which is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. After Jehoshaphat, his son Jehoram became king. Jehoram had several brothers, and their father gave them gifts of silver, gold, and fortified cities, but the kingdom was given to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.

When Jehoram established his rule, he killed all his brothers and some of the princes of Israel. He was 32 years old when he began to reign and ruled for eight years in Jerusalem. He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, influenced by his wife, the daughter of Ahab, and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. However, the Lord did not destroy David's house because of the covenant He had made with David.

During Jehoram's reign, the Edomites revolted and set up their own king. Jehoram attacked them at night and defeated them, but the Edomites remained in rebellion. Libnah also revolted because Jehoram had abandoned the Lord. He built high places in Judah, leading the people into idolatry.

Elijah the prophet sent Jehoram a letter saying that because he had not followed the ways of his father Jehoshaphat or Asa, but instead led Judah into sin and killed his brothers, the Lord would strike his people, children, wives, and possessions with a great plague. Jehoram himself would suffer a painful disease of the bowels.

The Lord stirred up the Philistines and Arabians against Jehoram. They invaded Judah, took all his possessions, and captured his sons and wives, leaving only his youngest son, Jehoahaz. After this, Jehoram was struck with an incurable disease, and after two years, he died in great pain. The people did not honor him with a fire as they had for his ancestors. He was 32 when he began to reign and ruled for eight years, dying without being mourned. He was buried in the city of David but not in the royal tombs.

The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, king because the raiders had killed all the older sons. Ahaziah was 42 years old when he began to reign and ruled for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, daughter of Omri. He followed the ways of Ahab's house, influenced by his mother, and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. He joined Jehoram, son of Ahab, in a war against Hazael, king of Syria, and was wounded. While recovering in Jezreel, he visited Jehoram, son of Ahab, and was caught up in Jehu's rebellion against Ahab's house. Ahaziah was captured and killed by Jehu's men.

When Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw her son was dead, she killed all the royal heirs of Judah. However, Jehoshabeath, daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, hid Ahaziah's son Joash and his nurse in a bedroom, saving him from Athaliah. Joash was hidden in the house of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.

In the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest strengthened himself and made a covenant with the captains of hundreds and the Levites. They gathered in Jerusalem and made a covenant with the king in the house of God, declaring that the king's son would reign as the Lord had promised. They organized a plan to protect the king, with a third of the priests and Levites guarding the doors, the king's house, and the gate of the foundation. The people were to stay in the courts of the Lord's house, and only the priests and ministering Levites were allowed inside. The Levites were to surround the king with weapons, ready to defend him.

Jehoiada the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears, shields, and bucklers that had belonged to King David, which were kept in the house of God. He stationed all the people, each with their weapon in hand.Jehoiada the priest positioned guards around the temple, from one side to the other, near the altar and the temple, surrounding the king. They brought out the king's son, crowned him, gave him the royal testimony, and anointed him as king, proclaiming, "Long live the king!"

When Athaliah heard the commotion and the people praising the new king, she went to the temple. She saw the king standing by his pillar, surrounded by leaders and trumpeters, with people rejoicing and musicians playing. Athaliah tore her clothes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"

Jehoiada the priest ordered the captains to remove her from the temple and kill anyone who followed her, but not to kill her in the temple. They seized her and killed her at the entrance of the Horse Gate near the king's house.

Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the people, and the king to be the Lord's people. The people then destroyed the temple of Baal, broke its altars and idols, and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal. Jehoiada assigned duties to the priests and Levites as David had instructed, to offer burnt offerings with joy and singing.

He stationed guards at the temple gates to prevent anyone unclean from entering. He gathered the leaders and people, brought the king from the temple, and they entered the king's house, placing the king on the throne. The people rejoiced, and the city was peaceful after Athaliah was killed.

Joash was seven years old when he became king and reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. Joash did what was right in the Lord's eyes as long as Jehoiada the priest was alive. Jehoiada arranged two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.

Later, Joash decided to repair the temple. He gathered the priests and Levites, instructing them to collect money from all Israel to repair the temple annually. However, the Levites did not act quickly. The king questioned Jehoiada about why the Levites had not collected the money as commanded by Moses for the tabernacle.

The sons of Athaliah had damaged the temple and used its sacred items for Baal worship. At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside the temple gate. A proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring the collection Moses had commanded. The people and leaders rejoiced and filled the chest with money.

The Levites brought the chest to the king's office daily, and when it was full, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer emptied it and returned it. They collected a large amount of money, which the king and Jehoiada used to hire workers to repair the temple. The workers restored and strengthened the temple, and the remaining money was used to make vessels for the temple.

Burnt offerings were made continually in the temple during Jehoiada's lifetime. Jehoiada lived to be 130 years old and was buried in the city of David among the kings for his good deeds toward God and the temple.

After Jehoiada's death, the leaders of Judah influenced the king, and they abandoned the temple, serving idols instead. God's wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for their sins. Prophets were sent to bring them back to the Lord, but they were ignored. Zechariah, son of Jehoiada, filled with the Spirit of God, warned them of their disobedience, but they conspired against him and stoned him to death by the king's command.

Joash forgot the kindness Jehoiada had shown him and killed his son. As Zechariah died, he said, "May the Lord see this and call you to account." At the end of the year, the Syrian army attacked Judah and Jerusalem, destroying the leaders and sending the spoils to the king of Damascus. The small Syrian army defeated a large host because Judah had forsaken the Lord.

Joash was severely wounded, and his servants conspired against him for killing Jehoiada's sons. They killed him in his bed, and he was buried in the city of David but not in the royal tombs. The conspirators were Zabad, son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith the Moabitess. The details of his sons, the burdens placed on him, and the temple repairs are recorded in the book of the kings. Amaziah, his son, succeeded him as king.

Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king and reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. He did what was right in the Lord's eyes but not wholeheartedly. When his kingdom was secure, he executed the servants who had killed his father but spared their children, following the law of Moses that each person should die for their own sin.

Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and Benjamin, organizing them into military units. He found 300,000 capable men and hired 100,000 warriors from Israel for 100 talents of silver. A man of God warned him not to let the Israelite army join him, as the Lord was not with Israel. Amaziah dismissed the Israelite soldiers, who left angrily.

Amaziah then led his army to the Valley of Salt, defeating 10,000 men of Seir. Another 10,000 were captured and thrown from a cliff, killing them. Meanwhile, the dismissed Israelite soldiers raided Judah's cities, killing 3,000 people and taking much spoil.

After defeating the Edomites, Amaziah brought their gods back and worshiped them, angering the Lord.Amaziah began worshiping the gods of the people he had defeated, which angered the Lord. A prophet was sent to him, asking why he sought gods that couldn't save their own people. Amaziah dismissed the prophet, who then warned that God had decided to destroy him for his disobedience.

Amaziah then challenged Joash, the king of Israel, to meet face-to-face. Joash responded with a parable, warning Amaziah to stay home and not seek trouble. Ignoring the warning, Amaziah went to battle and was defeated. Joash captured Amaziah, broke down part of Jerusalem's wall, and took treasures from the temple and the king's house.

Amaziah lived 15 years after Joash's death. Eventually, a conspiracy formed against him, and he fled to Lachish, where he was killed. He was buried in Judah, and his son Uzziah became king.

Uzziah, who was 16 when he became king, reigned for 52 years. He did what was right in the Lord's eyes and sought God during Zechariah's guidance. God helped him prosper, and he successfully waged wars, built cities, and fortified Jerusalem. Uzziah's fame spread as he grew stronger.

However, Uzziah's pride led to his downfall. He entered the temple to burn incense, a duty reserved for priests. Confronted by the priests, Uzziah became angry, and leprosy appeared on his forehead. He was forced to live in isolation until his death, and his son Jotham took over his duties.

Jotham, who became king at 25, reigned for 16 years. He did what was right in the Lord's eyes but did not enter the temple. He built cities and towers, fought and defeated the Ammonites, and became powerful because he followed God's ways. After his death, his son Ahaz became king.

Ahaz, who began his reign at 20, did not follow the Lord. He made idols, sacrificed his children, and worshiped in high places. As a result, God allowed him to be defeated by the kings of Syria and Israel, who took many captives and caused great destruction.The leaders of the Ephraim tribe—Azariah, Berechiah, Jehizkiah, and Amasa—stood against those returning from battle. They said, "You must not bring these captives here. We have already sinned against the Lord, and adding more to our sins will bring greater wrath upon Israel." So, the armed men released the captives and the spoils before the leaders and the congregation.

The men named took the captives, clothed the naked, provided shoes, food, and drink, and anointed them. They transported the weak on donkeys to Jericho, the city of palm trees, and then returned to Samaria.

During this time, King Ahaz sought help from the kings of Assyria because the Edomites had attacked Judah and taken captives. The Philistines also invaded the lowlands and southern cities of Judah, capturing several towns and villages. The Lord humbled Judah because of Ahaz's unfaithfulness, as he led Judah into sin and rebellion against the Lord.

King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria came to Ahaz but did not help him. Ahaz took treasures from the Lord's temple, the royal palace, and the leaders' houses to give to the Assyrian king, but it was in vain. In his distress, Ahaz sinned even more against the Lord by sacrificing to the gods of Damascus, believing they would help him. However, these actions led to his downfall and the ruin of Israel.

Ahaz desecrated the temple, shut its doors, and built altars in every corner of Jerusalem. He established high places in every city of Judah to burn incense to other gods, provoking the Lord's anger. The rest of Ahaz's deeds are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah succeeded him.

Hezekiah became king at 25 and reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah. Hezekiah did what was right in the Lord's eyes, following the example of his ancestor David. In the first year of his reign, he reopened and repaired the doors of the Lord's temple. He gathered the priests and Levites, instructing them to consecrate themselves and the temple, removing all impurity.

Hezekiah reminded them that their ancestors had sinned and turned away from the Lord, leading to the current troubles. He urged them to renew their covenant with the Lord to turn away His fierce wrath. The Levites, including Mahath, Joel, Kish, Azariah, Joah, Eden, Shimri, Jeiel, Zechariah, Mattaniah, Jehiel, Shimei, Shemaiah, and Uzziel, consecrated themselves and cleansed the temple as commanded by the king.

The priests removed all unclean items from the temple and the Levites carried them to the Kidron Valley. They began the cleansing on the first day of the first month and completed it by the sixteenth day. They reported to Hezekiah that the temple, the altar of burnt offerings, and all related vessels were cleansed and ready for use.

Hezekiah gathered the city leaders and went to the temple, offering seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. The priests, descendants of Aaron, offered these sacrifices on the altar. They sprinkled the blood of the bulls, rams, and lambs on the altar and laid hands on the goats for the sin offering.

The priests killed the goats and made atonement for all Israel, as commanded by the king. Hezekiah also set the Levites in the temple with musical instruments, as instructed by David, Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet. The Levites played David's instruments, and the priests blew trumpets as the burnt offering began. The congregation worshipped, sang, and played music until the offering was completed.

After the offerings, Hezekiah and all present bowed in worship. Hezekiah and the leaders instructed the Levites to sing praises to the Lord with the words of David and Asaph. They sang joyfully and worshipped. Hezekiah invited the people to bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple. The congregation willingly brought burnt offerings, totaling seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs, along with six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep as consecrated offerings.

The priests were too few to handle all the burnt offerings, so the Levites helped until the work was finished. The Levites were more diligent in consecrating themselves than the priests. The abundance of burnt offerings, peace offerings, and drink offerings set the temple service in order. Hezekiah and the people rejoiced at how quickly God had prepared them for this.

Hezekiah sent letters to all Israel and Judah, inviting them to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord God of Israel. The king, his officials, and the congregation decided to keep the Passover in the second month because the priests had not sufficiently consecrated themselves, and the people had not gathered in Jerusalem. This decision pleased the king and the congregation, so they issued a decree to proclaim it throughout Israel.Hezekiah sent messengers throughout Israel and Judah, from Beersheba to Dan, inviting everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord God of Israel. This hadn't been done in a long time as prescribed. The messengers carried letters from the king and his officials, urging the people to return to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, promising that He would be merciful to those who had escaped the Assyrian kings.

They were told not to be stubborn like their ancestors who disobeyed God and faced desolation. Instead, they were to submit to the Lord and enter His sanctuary, which He had sanctified forever, to turn away His fierce wrath. If they returned to the Lord, their captors would show compassion, and they would be able to return to their land because the Lord is gracious and merciful.

The messengers traveled through Ephraim, Manasseh, and Zebulun, but many people mocked and ridiculed them. However, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem. In Judah, God united the people to follow the king's command as instructed by the Lord. A large crowd gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.

They removed the altars in Jerusalem and threw them into the Kidron Valley. On the fourteenth day of the second month, they slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests and Levites, feeling ashamed, consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the Lord's house. They stood in their assigned places according to the Law of Moses, and the priests sprinkled the blood received from the Levites.

Since many in the congregation were not ceremonially clean, the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lambs for them. Many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not purified themselves but still ate the Passover. Hezekiah prayed for them, asking the Lord to pardon everyone who sought God, even if they were not ceremonially clean. The Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people.

The Israelites in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. The Levites and priests praised the Lord daily with loud instruments. Hezekiah encouraged the Levites who taught about the Lord, and they ate throughout the feast, offering peace offerings and confessing to the Lord God of their ancestors. The assembly decided to celebrate for another seven days, and they did so with gladness.

King Hezekiah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the congregation, and the officials gave a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. Many priests consecrated themselves. The entire assembly of Judah, along with the priests, Levites, and those from Israel and Judah, rejoiced. There was great joy in Jerusalem, unlike anything since the days of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel. The priests and Levites blessed the people, and their prayers reached heaven.

After the celebration, the Israelites went to the cities of Judah and destroyed the idols, altars, and high places in Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. They returned to their own cities. Hezekiah organized the priests and Levites into divisions for their service, including burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister, give thanks, and praise at the gates of the Lord's dwelling.

Hezekiah also allocated a portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings, including those for the Sabbaths, new moons, and appointed feasts as written in the Law of the Lord. He commanded the people in Jerusalem to provide for the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the Lord. The Israelites responded by bringing the firstfruits of their produce and tithes in abundance.

In the third month, they began to pile up the contributions and finished in the seventh month. When Hezekiah and the officials saw the heaps, they praised the Lord and His people Israel. Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps, and Azariah, the chief priest, explained that since the people began bringing offerings, they had plenty to eat and much left over because the Lord had blessed them.

Hezekiah ordered storerooms to be prepared in the Lord's house, and they faithfully brought in the offerings, tithes, and dedicated items. Cononiah the Levite was in charge, with his brother Shimei as the assistant. Other overseers included Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah, under the direction of Cononiah and Shimei, as commanded by Hezekiah and Azariah, the ruler of the house of God.

Kore, son of Imnah the Levite, was in charge of distributing the freewill offerings of God and the most holy things. Assisting him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the priests' cities, distributing portions to their fellow priests and Levites according to their divisions, regardless of age. They also distributed portions to the males three years old and above who entered the Lord's house for their daily duties.

Hezekiah did what was good, right, and faithful before the Lord his God. In everything he undertook in the service of God's house, in obedience to the law and commands, he sought his God wholeheartedly and prospered.

After these events, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invaded Judah and besieged the fortified cities, intending to conquer them. When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to fight against Jerusalem, he consulted with his officials and military leaders to stop the water supply outside the city, and they helped him. A large number of people gathered to block all the springs and the stream flowing through the land, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?"

Hezekiah strengthened himself, repaired all the broken sections of the wall, built towers, and constructed another wall outside. He reinforced the Millo in the City of David and made a large number of weapons and shields. He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them in the square at the city gate, encouraging them with these words: "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him. With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles." The people gained confidence from Hezekiah's words.After this, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem while he himself besieged Lachish with his full military force. He sent a message to Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all the people in Jerusalem, saying, "On what are you basing your confidence to remain under siege in Jerusalem? Isn't Hezekiah misleading you, telling you that the Lord will deliver you from the king of Assyria? Didn't Hezekiah remove the high places and altars, commanding Judah and Jerusalem to worship at one altar and burn incense on it? Don't you know what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of those nations able to deliver their lands from my hand? Who among all the gods of these nations that my ancestors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your God deliver you from my hand? Don't let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this. No god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?"

Sennacherib's servants continued to speak against the Lord God and His servant Hezekiah. He also wrote letters ridiculing the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, "Just as the gods of the other nations did not rescue their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not rescue His people from my hand." They shouted in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, trying to terrify them and make them afraid so they could capture the city. They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world, which are made by human hands.

King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to heaven about this. And the Lord sent an angel who annihilated all the fighting men, commanders, and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So Sennacherib withdrew in disgrace to his own land. When he went into the temple of his god, some of his own sons killed him with the sword. So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, and from all others. He took care of them on every side. Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord and valuable gifts for Hezekiah, king of Judah. From then on, he was highly regarded by all the nations.

In those days, Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the Lord, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign. But Hezekiah's heart was proud, and he did not respond to the kindness shown to him. Therefore, the Lord's wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem. So the Lord's wrath did not come upon them during Hezekiah's lifetime.

Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor. He made treasuries for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuables. He also made storehouses for the harvest of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle and pens for the flocks. He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches. It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook.

However, when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart. The other events of Hezekiah's reign, including his acts of devotion, are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Hezekiah rested with his ancestors and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David's descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And his son Manasseh succeeded him as king.

Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for fifty-five years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished, erected altars to the Baals, and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them. He built altars in the temple of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, "My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever." In both courts of the temple of the Lord, he built altars to all the starry hosts. He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, arousing His anger. He took the image he had made and put it in God's temple, of which God had said to David and his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees, and regulations given through Moses." But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites.

The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. So the Lord brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon. In his distress, he sought the favor of the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors. And when he prayed to him, the Lord was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea. So he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God.

Afterward, he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah. He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the Lord, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem, and threw them out of the city. Then he restored the altar of the Lord and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it and told Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel. The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the Lord their God.

The other events of Manasseh's reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel. His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself, are all written in the records of the seers. Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace. And Amon, his son, succeeded him as king.

Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for two years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made. But unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the Lord; Amon increased his guilt. His officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah, his son, king in his place.

Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for thirty-one years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and followed the ways of his ancestor David, not turning aside to the right or to the left. In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his ancestor David. In the twelfth year, he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles, and idols. Under his direction, the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them and smashed the Asherah poles and the idols. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem. In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them, he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.In the eighteenth year of his reign, after purging the land and the temple, King Josiah sent Shaphan, Maaseiah, and Joah to repair the temple of the Lord. They delivered the money collected from the people to the high priest Hilkiah, who then gave it to the workers overseeing the temple repairs. The workers used the funds to buy materials and repair the temple faithfully.

During the repairs, Hilkiah found the Book of the Law given by Moses. He gave it to Shaphan, who read it to King Josiah. Upon hearing the words, Josiah tore his clothes in distress and commanded his officials to seek the Lord's guidance about the book's contents, fearing God's wrath for their ancestors' disobedience.

The officials consulted Huldah the prophetess, who confirmed that disaster would come upon the land due to their disobedience. However, because Josiah humbled himself before God, he would be spared from witnessing the impending calamity.

Josiah then gathered all the elders and people of Judah and Jerusalem, read the Book of the Covenant to them, and renewed the covenant with the Lord. He removed all idolatrous items from the land and led the people to serve the Lord faithfully.

Josiah also organized a grand Passover celebration, unlike any seen since the days of Samuel the prophet. He provided offerings for the people, priests, and Levites, ensuring everyone participated in the feast.

Later, when Necho, king of Egypt, marched to fight at Carchemish, Josiah confronted him despite Necho's warning that God had sent him. Josiah was wounded in battle and died, and his body was brought back to Jerusalem for burial.Josiah was buried in the tombs of his ancestors, and all of Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him. The prophet Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and these laments became a tradition in Israel, recorded in the book of Lamentations.

Josiah's deeds, both good and bad, are documented in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. After Josiah's death, the people made his son Jehoahaz king. Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he began to reign, but he only ruled for three months before the king of Egypt deposed him and imposed a heavy tribute on the land. The king of Egypt then made Jehoahaz's brother Eliakim king, renaming him Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz to Egypt.

Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem, doing evil in the sight of the Lord. During his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, captured him and took him to Babylon along with some of the temple's treasures. Jehoiakim's actions and abominations are also recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. His son Jehoiachin succeeded him.

Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for three months and ten days in Jerusalem, also doing evil in the sight of the Lord. Nebuchadnezzar then took him to Babylon along with more temple treasures and made Zedekiah, Jehoiachin's brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.

Zedekiah was 21 years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem, doing evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not humble himself before the prophet Jeremiah and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear allegiance to God. Zedekiah and the people, including the priests, committed many sins and defiled the temple.

Despite God's repeated warnings through his messengers, the people mocked and mistreated them until God's wrath was inevitable. Consequently, the king of the Chaldeans attacked, killing many and showing no mercy. He took all the valuable items from the temple and the king's house to Babylon, burned the temple, destroyed Jerusalem's walls, and took the survivors to Babylon as servants until the Persian kingdom rose to power.

This fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, as the land enjoyed its sabbaths for 70 years while it lay desolate. In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, God stirred his spirit to proclaim throughout his kingdom that the Lord had given him all the kingdoms of the earth and charged him to build a house for Him in Jerusalem. Cyrus invited all of God's people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple, offering them support with silver, gold, goods, and livestock.

The leaders of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites, whose spirits God had moved, prepared to go and rebuild the temple. Their neighbors supported them with silver, gold, goods, livestock, and other valuable items. Cyrus also returned the temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had taken to Babylon, handing them over to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.

The total number of gold and silver vessels was 5,400, and Sheshbazzar brought them all back to Jerusalem. The people who returned from captivity included the descendants of various families and towns, each returning to their own city. The list of returnees included leaders like Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, and others, along with their families and the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants.The descendants of Shalmai, Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah, Besai, Asnah, Mehunim, Nephusim, Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha, Barkos, Sisera, Thamah, Neziah, and Hatipha were among those who returned. 

The descendants of Solomon's servants included the families of Sotai, Sophereth, Peruda, Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel, Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth of Zebaim, and Ami. In total, there were 392 Nethinims and descendants of Solomon's servants.

Some people from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer couldn't prove their Israelite ancestry. This included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, totaling 652 people. Among the priests, the families of Habaiah, Koz, and Barzillai (who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and took their name) couldn't find their genealogical records and were excluded from the priesthood. The governor told them not to eat the most holy food until a priest with Urim and Thummim could decide their status.

The entire assembly numbered 42,360, not including 7,337 servants and maids, and 200 singers. They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys. Some family leaders donated generously to the temple's construction, contributing 61,000 gold drachmas, 5,000 pounds of silver, and 100 priestly garments.

The priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants settled in their towns, and all Israel lived in their cities. In the seventh month, the Israelites gathered in Jerusalem. Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and his fellow priests, along with Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings as prescribed by Moses. Despite their fear of neighboring peoples, they offered burnt offerings morning and evening, celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, and followed the daily offerings as required.

They began offering burnt offerings on the first day of the seventh month, even though the temple's foundation hadn't been laid. They paid masons and carpenters and provided food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus, king of Persia.

In the second month of the second year after their arrival in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the priests and Levites, along with all who had returned from captivity, began work on the temple. They appointed Levites aged 20 and older to oversee the work. Jeshua and his family, along with Kadmiel and the sons of Judah, supervised the workers. The Levites, including the sons of Henadad, joined them.

When the builders laid the temple's foundation, the priests in their robes, with trumpets, and the Levites, sons of Asaph, with cymbals, praised the Lord according to the instructions of King David. They sang in praise and thanks to the Lord, declaring His goodness and enduring mercy toward Israel. The people shouted with joy, but many older priests and Levites who had seen the first temple wept loudly. The noise of joy and weeping was so loud it could be heard from afar.

When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were rebuilding the temple, they approached Zerubbabel and the family leaders, offering to help. They claimed to worship the same God and had been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria. However, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders refused their help, insisting they alone would build the temple as commanded by King Cyrus of Persia.

The local people then tried to discourage and intimidate the builders, hiring advisors to frustrate their plans throughout the reign of Cyrus until Darius became king of Persia. During the reign of Ahasuerus, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. In the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote a letter to the king in Aramaic, which was translated.

Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, listing various officials and peoples who supported them. They warned the king that if Jerusalem was rebuilt and its walls restored, the city would not pay taxes, duties, or tolls, harming the royal revenue. They claimed to be loyal subjects and didn't want to see the king dishonored, so they urged him to search the records and find that Jerusalem had a history of rebellion and sedition, which led to its destruction.

King Artaxerxes responded, confirming the city's rebellious past and ordering the work to stop until he issued further commands. The letter was read to Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates, who then hurried to Jerusalem and forced the Jews to stop building by force. Thus, the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a halt.The construction of the temple in Jerusalem stopped until the second year of King Darius of Persia. During this time, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem to continue building the temple in the name of the God of Israel. Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, son of Jozadak, resumed the construction with the help of the prophets.

Governor Tatnai and his companions questioned who had authorized the building of the temple and the wall. The Jewish elders responded that they were servants of the God of heaven and earth, rebuilding the temple that had been constructed many years ago by a great king of Israel. They explained that their ancestors had angered God, leading to their defeat by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who destroyed the temple and exiled the people.

However, in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon, he decreed the rebuilding of the temple and returned the gold and silver vessels taken by Nebuchadnezzar. These were given to Sheshbazzar, whom Cyrus appointed as governor, and he laid the foundation of the temple, which had been under construction since then but was not yet finished.

The Jewish elders requested that King Darius search the royal archives in Babylon to confirm Cyrus's decree. King Darius ordered a search, and a scroll was found in the palace at Achmetha in the province of the Medes. The scroll confirmed that Cyrus had decreed the rebuilding of the temple, specifying its dimensions and that the expenses were to be covered by the royal treasury. The gold and silver vessels were to be returned to the temple in Jerusalem.

King Darius instructed Governor Tatnai and his companions to allow the Jews to continue their work without interference. He also decreed that the expenses for the construction be provided from the royal treasury and that the necessary animals and supplies for sacrifices be given to the priests daily. Anyone who altered this decree would be punished by having timber pulled from their house and being hanged on it, and their house would be made a dunghill. Darius prayed that God would destroy any king or people who tried to alter or destroy the temple.

Tatnai and his companions complied with King Darius's orders, and the Jewish elders continued building and prospered under the guidance of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. They completed the temple according to the commands of God and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. The temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year of King Darius's reign.

The Israelites, including the priests, Levites, and those who had returned from captivity, joyfully dedicated the temple. They offered numerous sacrifices and set the priests and Levites in their divisions for temple service as prescribed in the book of Moses. They celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, with the priests and Levites purified and offering the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles and their fellow priests. They also observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, as the Lord had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to support their work on the temple.

During the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra, a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, went up from Babylon to Jerusalem. The king granted him all his requests, and some Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants accompanied him. They arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of King Artaxerxes's reign. Ezra had devoted himself to studying, practicing, and teaching the law of the Lord in Israel.

King Artaxerxes gave Ezra a letter authorizing him to lead any willing Israelites, priests, and Levites to Jerusalem. The letter also instructed Ezra to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem according to God's law and to carry silver and gold freely offered by the king and his counselors for the temple in Jerusalem. Ezra was to use the money to buy animals and offerings for the temple and to offer them on the altar.King Artaxerxes issued a decree allowing Ezra and his fellow Israelites to use the remaining silver and gold as they saw fit for the service of their God. He also instructed that any additional needs for the temple should be provided from the king's treasury. Artaxerxes commanded all treasurers beyond the river to fulfill any requests from Ezra, the priest and scribe, promptly. This included up to 100 talents of silver, 100 measures of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and unlimited salt.

The king emphasized that everything commanded by the God of heaven should be done diligently to avoid any wrath against the king and his sons. He also declared that no taxes, tolls, or customs should be imposed on the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or any ministers of the house of God.

Ezra was instructed to appoint magistrates and judges to govern the people beyond the river, teaching those who were unfamiliar with God's laws. Anyone who disobeyed these laws or the king's laws was to be punished swiftly, whether by death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment.

Ezra praised the Lord, the God of their ancestors, for inspiring the king to beautify the house of the Lord in Jerusalem and for showing mercy to him before the king and his counselors. Strengthened by God's support, Ezra gathered leading men from Israel to accompany him.

Ezra listed the heads of families and their genealogies who traveled with him from Babylon during King Artaxerxes's reign. They camped by the river Ahava for three days, where Ezra reviewed the people and priests but found no Levites. He sent for leaders and men of understanding to bring ministers for the house of God. By God's grace, they brought a man of understanding from the descendants of Mahli, along with others, totaling 220 temple servants.

Ezra proclaimed a fast by the river Ahava to seek God's guidance and protection for their journey, as he was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers, having declared that God's hand was upon those who sought Him. They fasted and prayed, and God answered their prayers.

Ezra then entrusted twelve leading priests with the silver, gold, and vessels offered for the house of God, weighing them carefully. He reminded them that they and the offerings were holy to the Lord and instructed them to guard these items until they were weighed before the chief priests and Levites in Jerusalem.

They departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, and God protected them from enemies along the way. Upon arriving in Jerusalem, they rested for three days. On the fourth day, they weighed the silver, gold, and vessels in the house of God, recording the weights. The returned exiles offered burnt offerings to God, including bulls, rams, lambs, and goats.

They delivered the king's orders to the king's lieutenants and governors, who supported the people and the house of God.

After these events, the leaders informed Ezra that the Israelites, including priests and Levites, had not separated themselves from the local peoples and their abominations. They had intermarried with the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites, with the leaders and officials being the worst offenders.

Ezra was deeply distressed upon hearing this and tore his garments, pulled out his hair, and sat in shock. Those who trembled at God's words gathered around him. At the evening sacrifice, Ezra rose from his mourning, fell to his knees, and spread out his hands to God, confessing the people's sins and expressing shame for their iniquities, which had led to their current suffering.

Despite their sins, God had shown them mercy, allowing a remnant to return and rebuild the temple. Ezra acknowledged that they had forsaken God's commandments, which warned against mingling with the unclean peoples of the land."Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek their peace or prosperity forever, so that you may be strong, enjoy the good of the land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children forever. 

After all the punishment we have faced for our evil deeds and great sins, you, our God, have punished us less than we deserve and have given us this deliverance. Should we then break your commandments again and intermarry with these people who commit abominations? Would you not be angry with us until you have destroyed us, leaving no remnant or escape? 

O Lord God of Israel, you are righteous. We are left as a remnant, as it is today. We stand before you in our sins, for we cannot stand before you because of them.

When Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large assembly of men, women, and children from Israel gathered around him, weeping bitterly. Shechaniah, son of Jehiel, from the descendants of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, 'We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. Let us make a covenant with our God to send away all these women and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and those who tremble at the command of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.'

Ezra then made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been suggested, and they took the oath. Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan, son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.

A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property and be expelled from the assembly of the exiles. 

Within three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. On the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, 'You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt. Now honor the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.'

The whole assembly responded with a loud voice, 'You are right! We must do as you say. But there are many people here and it is the rainy season, so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.' 

Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite. So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month, they sat down to investigate the cases, and by the first day of the first month, they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.

Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women: from the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers, Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt, they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.

From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah. From the descendants of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

Among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (also called Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. From the musicians: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.

And among the other Israelites: from the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah. From the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah. From the descendants of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza. From the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai. From the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth. From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh. From the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah. From the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei. From the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi, Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau. From the descendants of Binnui: Shimei, Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph. From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah. All these had married foreign women, and some of them had children by these wives.

The Book of Nehemiah

The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:

In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem. They said to me, 'Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.'

When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. Then I said:

'Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's family, have committed against you. We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees, and laws you gave your servant Moses.

Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, "If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name."

They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.'

I was cupbearer to the king.

In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before, so the king asked me, 'Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart.'

I was very much afraid, but I said to the king, 'May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?'

The king said to me, 'What is it you want?'

Then I prayed to the God of heaven, and I answered the king, 'If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it.'

Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, 'How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?' It pleased the king to send me, so I set a time.

I also said to him, 'If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah? And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?' And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests."With God's favor, I delivered the king's letters to the governors beyond the river. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me. When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very upset that someone had come to help the Israelites.

After arriving in Jerusalem, I stayed there for three days. Then, at night, I took a few men with me and didn't tell anyone what God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. We had no animals with us except the one I was riding.

I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Dragon Well and the Dung Gate, inspecting the broken walls of Jerusalem and its burned gates. Then I moved on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was no room for my mount to get through. So I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and re-entered through the Valley Gate.

The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or any others who would be doing the work. Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace." I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me.

They replied, "Let us start rebuilding." So they began this good work. But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"

I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."

Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of Hananel. The men of Jericho built the adjoining section, and Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.

The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and put its doors and bolts and bars in place. Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired the next section. Next to him, Meshullam son of Berekiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs, and next to him, Zadok son of Baana also made repairs. The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work under their supervisors.

The Jeshanah Gate was repaired by Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah. They laid its beams and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place. Next to them, repairs were made by men from Gibeon and Mizpah—Melatiah of Gibeon and Jadon of Meronoth—places under the authority of the governor of Trans-Euphrates. Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the next section; and Hananiah, one of the perfume-makers, made repairs next to that. They restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section. Adjoining this, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs next to him.

Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens. Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section with the help of his daughters.

The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place. They also repaired a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate. The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Rekab, ruler of the district of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it and put its doors with their bolts and bars in place.

The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Kol-Hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofing it over and putting its doors and bolts and bars in place. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Siloam, by the King's Garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David. Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth Zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Heroes.

Next to him, the repairs were made by the Levites under Rehum son of Bani. Beside him, Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district. Next to him, the repairs were made by their fellow Levites under Binnui son of Henadad, ruler of the other half-district of Keilah. Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section, from a point facing the ascent to the armory as far as the angle of the wall.

Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the angle to the entrance of the house of Eliashib the high priest. Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another section, from the entrance of Eliashib's house to the end of it. The repairs next to him were made by the priests from the surrounding region. Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house; and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house. Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from Azariah's house to the angle and the corner, and Palal son of Uzai worked opposite the angle and the tower projecting from the upper palace near the court of the guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh and the temple servants living on the hill of Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower. Next to them, the men of Tekoa repaired another section, from the great projecting tower to the wall of Ophel.

Above the Horse Gate, the priests made repairs, each in front of his own house. Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. Next to him, Shemaiah son of Shekaniah, the guard at the East Gate, made repairs. Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah made repairs opposite his living quarters. Next to him, Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the room above the corner; and between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.

When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews, and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, "What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble—burned as they are?"

Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, "What they are building—even a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones!"

Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders.

So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart. But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.

Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall."

Also, our enemies said, "Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work."

Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us."

Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears, and bows. After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes."

When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work. From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other.Each worker carried materials with one hand and held a weapon with the other. The builders had their swords strapped to their sides as they worked, and the trumpeter stayed with me. I told the nobles, officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and we are spread out along the wall. Whenever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us."

We worked from dawn until the stars appeared, with half the men holding spears. I also instructed the people to stay inside Jerusalem at night to serve as guards and work during the day. None of us, including my brothers, servants, and guards, took off our clothes except for washing.

There was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews. Some said, "We need grain to eat and stay alive." Others said, "We have mortgaged our fields, vineyards, and homes to buy grain during the famine." Still others said, "We have borrowed money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards. We are as good as our fellow Jews, but we have to sell our sons and daughters into slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, and we can't do anything because our fields and vineyards belong to others."

I was very angry when I heard their complaints. After thinking it over, I confronted the nobles and officials, accusing them of charging interest to their own people. I called a large assembly and said, "We have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to foreigners, but now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!" They were silent and couldn't find anything to say.

I continued, "What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our enemies? I, my brothers, and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest. Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, and also the interest you are charging them—one percent of the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil."

They agreed to give everything back and not demand anything more from the people. I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised. I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way, may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise." The whole assembly responded, "Amen," and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised.

From the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year—twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God, I did not act like that. Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.

Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations. Each day, one ox, six choice sheep, and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. Despite all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.

Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.

When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates—Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono." But they were scheming to harm me; so I sent messengers to them with this reply: "I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?"

Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer. Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter in which was written: "It is reported among the nations—and Geshem says it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports, you are about to become their king and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together."

I sent him this reply: "Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head." They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed." But I prayed, "Now strengthen my hands."

One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, "Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you."

But I said, "Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!" I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.

Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me.

So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days. When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.

Also in those days, the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was the son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.

After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians, and the Levites were appointed. I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most people do. I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses."

The city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt. So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:

These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to their own town, in company with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.

The list of the men of Israel:

The descendants of the other Elam were 1,254. The descendants of Harim were 320. The descendants of Jericho were 345. The descendants of Lod, Hadid, and Ono were 721. The descendants of Senaah were 3,930.

The priests: the descendants of Jedaiah, from the house of Jeshua, were 973. The descendants of Immer were 1,052. The descendants of Pashur were 1,247. The descendants of Harim were 1,017.

The Levites: the descendants of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the descendants of Hodevah were 74.

The singers: the descendants of Asaph were 148.

The gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai were 138.

The temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, Hashupha, Tabbaoth, Keros, Sia, Padon, Lebana, Hagaba, Shalmai, Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, Gazzam, Uzza, Phaseah, Besai, Meunim, Nephishesim, Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, Bazlith, Mehida, Harsha, Barkos, Sisera, Tamah, Neziah, and Hatipha.

The descendants of Solomon's servants: the descendants of Sotai, Sophereth, Perida, Jaala, Darkon, Giddel, Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth of Zebaim, and Amon. All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants were 392.

These were the people who came up from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their family lineage or whether they were of Israel. The descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda were 642. Among the priests: the descendants of Habaiah, Koz, and Barzillai, who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name. These searched for their family records but could not find them, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. The governor ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until a priest ministering with Urim and Thummim could be found.

The whole assembly together was 42,360, besides their 7,337 male and female servants, and they also had 245 male and female singers. They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.

Some of the family heads contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics of gold, 50 bowls, and 530 garments for priests. Some of the family heads gave to the treasury for the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver. The rest of the people gave 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 garments for priests.

The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, musicians, temple servants, and some of the people, along with the rest of Israel, settled in their own towns. When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, all the people assembled as one in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the teacher of the Law to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded for Israel.

So on the first day of the seventh month, Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand. He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women, and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.

Ezra the teacher of the Law stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up. Ezra praised the Lord, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and responded, "Amen! Amen!" Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.

The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there. They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people understood what was being read.

Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and teacher of the Law, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, "This day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law. Nehemiah said, "Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength."

The Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for this is a holy day. Do not grieve." Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.

On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the teacher to give attention to the words of the Law. They found written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: "Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms, and shade trees, to make temporary shelters—as it is written."

So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God, and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim. The whole company that had returned from exile built temporary shelters and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great.

Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly.

On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads. Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors. They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a quarter of the day and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the Lord their God. Standing on the stairs of the Levites were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani. They cried out with loud voices to the Lord their God. And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said: "Stand up and praise the Lord your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise. You alone are the Lord. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you. You are the Lord God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham. You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites.""You kept your promise to give the land to Abraham's descendants because you are righteous. You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cries at the Red Sea. You performed miracles against Pharaoh and his people because you knew they treated us arrogantly. You made a name for yourself that endures to this day. You parted the sea for our ancestors to cross on dry land, and you threw their pursuers into the depths like a stone in mighty waters. You led them by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night to show them the way.

You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven, giving them just laws and true commandments. You made your holy Sabbath known to them and gave them laws through Moses. You provided bread from heaven for their hunger and water from a rock for their thirst. You promised them the land you swore to give them.

But our ancestors were arrogant and stubborn, ignoring your commandments. They refused to obey and forgot the miracles you performed among them. In their rebellion, they appointed a leader to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving, gracious, and merciful God, slow to anger and full of kindness. You did not abandon them, even when they made a golden calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt,' committing great blasphemies.

In your great mercy, you did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud continued to lead them by day, and the pillar of fire by night. You gave them your good spirit to instruct them and did not withhold manna from their mouths or water for their thirst. For forty years, you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.

You gave them kingdoms and nations, dividing them among the tribes. They took possession of the land of Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan. You made their descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and brought them into the land you promised their ancestors. They went in and took possession of the land, subduing its inhabitants, the Canaanites, and capturing fortified cities and fertile land. They enjoyed houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate, were satisfied, and delighted in your great goodness.

Despite this, they were disobedient and rebelled against you, casting your law behind their backs and killing your prophets who warned them to return to you. They committed great blasphemies. So you handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. But in their time of trouble, when they cried out to you, you heard from heaven and in your great mercy, you sent deliverers who rescued them from their enemies.

But as soon as they were at rest, they did evil again before you. So you abandoned them to their enemies, who ruled over them. Yet when they turned back and cried out to you, you heard from heaven and delivered them many times in your mercy. You warned them to return to your law, but they were arrogant and disobedient, sinning against your judgments. They turned their backs on you, stiffened their necks, and refused to listen.

For many years, you were patient with them. By your spirit, you warned them through your prophets, but they would not listen. So you handed them over to the peoples of the lands. Yet in your great mercy, you did not destroy them completely or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.

Now, our God, the great, mighty, and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem insignificant to you—the hardship that has come upon us, our kings, leaders, priests, prophets, ancestors, and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today. In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly. Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep. Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness, in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.

But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our ancestors so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces. Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.

In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, Levites, and priests are affixing their seals to it."The leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, while the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, and the other nine to live in other cities. The people praised all the men who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem. Here are the leaders who lived in Jerusalem: in the cities of Judah, everyone lived in their own property, including Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants of Solomon's servants.

In Jerusalem, some of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin lived. From Judah's descendants: Athaiah, son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalaleel, from the descendants of Perez; and Maaseiah, son of Baruch, son of Colhozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, son of Shiloni. The total number of Perez's descendants living in Jerusalem was 468 brave men.

From Benjamin's descendants: Sallu, son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jesaiah, and after him Gabbai and Sallai, totaling 928. Joel, son of Zichri, was their overseer, and Judah, son of Senuah, was second in command over the city.

From the priests: Jedaiah, son of Joiarib, Jachin, and Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, who was the ruler of the house of God. Their associates, who did the work of the temple, numbered 822. Adaiah, son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashur, son of Malchiah, and his associates, the leaders of families, numbered 242. Amashai, son of Azareel, son of Ahasai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer, and his associates, who were brave men, numbered 128. Their overseer was Zabdiel, son of Haggedolim.

From the Levites: Shemaiah, son of Hashub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni; and Shabbethai and Jozabad, who were in charge of the outside work of the house of God. Mattaniah, son of Mika, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, was the leader who began the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah was second among his associates, and Abda, son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun. The total number of Levites in the holy city was 284.

The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their associates, who kept the gates, numbered 172. The rest of Israel, including the priests and Levites, lived in all the cities of Judah, each on their own property. The temple servants lived in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of them.

The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi, son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mika, from the descendants of Asaph, who were the singers responsible for the service of the house of God. The king had commanded that a daily portion be given to the singers. Pethahiah, son of Meshezabeel, from the descendants of Zerah, son of Judah, was the king's advisor in all matters concerning the people.

For the villages with their fields, some of the descendants of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its surrounding villages, in Dibon and its surrounding villages, in Jekabzeel and its surrounding villages, in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth Pelet, Hazar Shual, Beersheba and its surrounding villages, in Ziklag, Meconah and its surrounding villages, in En Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its surrounding villages. They lived from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.

The descendants of Benjamin lived in Geba, Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its surrounding villages, in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, Lod, and Ono, the Valley of Craftsmen. Some of the Levites were in divisions in Judah and Benjamin.

These are the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, Shekaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah, Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.

The Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was in charge of the thanksgiving songs, and his associates. Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, stood opposite them in the services. Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim was the father of Eliashib, Eliashib was the father of Joiada, Joiada was the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.

In the days of Joiakim, these were the leaders of the priestly families: from Seraiah's family, Meraiah; from Jeremiah's family, Hananiah; from Ezra's family, Meshullam; from Amariah's family, Jehohanan; from Malluch's family, Jonathan; from Shekaniah's family, Joseph; from Harim's family, Adna; from Meraioth's family, Helkai; from Iddo's family, Zechariah; from Ginnethon's family, Meshullam; from Abijah's family, Zichri; from Miniamin's family, Piltai; from Moadiah's family, Piltai; from Bilgah's family, Shammua; from Shemaiah's family, Jehonathan; from Joiarib's family, Mattenai; from Jedaiah's family, Uzzi; from Sallu's family, Kallai; from Amok's family, Eber; from Hilkiah's family, Hashabiah; from Jedaiah's family, Nethanel.

The leaders of the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were recorded in the book of the chronicles up to the reign of Darius the Persian. The leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, son of Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, as commanded by David, the man of God, one section opposite the other. Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.

These were in the days of Joiakim, son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe. At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, thanksgiving, singing, cymbals, harps, and lyres. The singers gathered from the region around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites, from Beth Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. The priests and Levites purified themselves, the people, the gates, and the wall.

I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and appointed two large choirs to give thanks. One went to the right on the wall toward the Dung Gate. Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, and some of the priests with trumpets, including Zechariah, son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph, and his associates: Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe led them. At the Fountain Gate, they went straight up the steps of the City of David, on the ascent to the wall, and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.

The second choir went in the opposite direction, and I followed them with half of the people on the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, above the Gate of Ephraim, the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate, and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard. The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God, along with me and half of the officials, as well as the priests: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with trumpets, and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang under the direction of Jezrahiah.

On that day, they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced, and the sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away. At that time, men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits, and tithes. They were to collect from the fields around the towns the portions required by the Law for the priests and Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites. They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon. For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.Nehemiah ensured that the daily portions were given to the singers and gatekeepers, and they dedicated holy items to the Levites, who in turn dedicated them to the descendants of Aaron. 

On that day, they read from the Book of Moses to the people and discovered that the Ammonites and Moabites should never be allowed into God's assembly because they did not help the Israelites with food and water but instead hired Balaam to curse them. However, God turned the curse into a blessing. Upon hearing this, the Israelites separated themselves from all foreigners.

Before this, Eliashib the priest, who was in charge of the storerooms of God's house, had allied with Tobiah and prepared a large room for him, which was previously used to store offerings, incense, temple articles, and tithes of grain, new wine, and oil for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests. During this time, Nehemiah was not in Jerusalem, as he had returned to King Artaxerxes of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign. After some time, Nehemiah obtained permission from the king to return to Jerusalem, where he discovered the wrong Eliashib had done for Tobiah by preparing a room for him in the temple courts. Nehemiah was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah's belongings out of the room. He then ordered the rooms to be purified and restored the temple articles, along with the grain offerings and incense.

Nehemiah also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given to them, so the Levites and singers had returned to their fields. He confronted the officials, asking why the house of God was neglected, and gathered the Levites and singers back to their posts. All of Judah then brought the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil into the storerooms. Nehemiah appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites as treasurers over the storerooms, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, assisting them, as they were considered trustworthy. Their responsibility was to distribute the supplies to their fellow Levites.

Nehemiah prayed, asking God to remember him for his good deeds for the house of God and its services. 

During those days, Nehemiah saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, bringing in grain, loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. He warned them against selling food on that day. People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were also bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah. Nehemiah confronted the nobles of Judah, asking why they were profaning the Sabbath, reminding them that their ancestors' actions had brought calamity upon them and the city. He warned that they were bringing more wrath upon Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.

Nehemiah ordered the gates of Jerusalem to be shut as evening approached before the Sabbath and not to be opened until after the Sabbath. He stationed some of his men at the gates to ensure no load was brought in on the Sabbath day. Once or twice, merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem, but Nehemiah warned them that if they did so again, he would take action against them. From then on, they did not come on the Sabbath. Nehemiah instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. He prayed, asking God to remember him and show mercy according to His great love.

In those days, Nehemiah also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. Their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples and could not speak the language of Judah. Nehemiah rebuked them, cursed them, beat some of them, and pulled out their hair. He made them swear by God not to give their daughters in marriage to the sons of foreigners or take foreign daughters for their sons or themselves. He reminded them that even King Solomon of Israel sinned because of foreign women, despite being loved by God and made king over all Israel. Foreign women led him into sin, and Nehemiah questioned why they would commit such a great evil by marrying foreign women and being unfaithful to God.

One of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, so Nehemiah drove him away. He prayed, asking God to remember them for defiling the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. Nehemiah purified the priests and Levites from everything foreign and assigned them duties, each to his own task. He also made arrangements for the wood offering at appointed times and for the firstfruits. He prayed, asking God to remember him for good.

In the days of King Ahasuerus, who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia, he held a great feast for all his officials and servants in the third year of his reign. The feast showcased the wealth and splendor of his kingdom for 180 days. After these days, the king held a seven-day feast in the garden courtyard of the king's palace for all the people present in Shushan, from the greatest to the least. The courtyard was decorated with white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of red, blue, white, and black marble. Drinks were served in golden vessels, each different from the other, and royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king's generosity. The drinking was according to the law; no one was compelled to drink, for the king had instructed all the officials of his household to serve each person as they desired. Queen Vashti also held a feast for the women in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.

On the seventh day, when King Ahasuerus was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas—to bring Queen Vashti before him wearing her royal crown, to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at. But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by the eunuchs. The king became furious, and his anger burned within him. He consulted the wise men who understood the times, for it was customary for the king to consult experts in law and justice. The seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom—Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan—were asked what should be done to Queen Vashti for not obeying the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs.

Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, saying that Queen Vashti had wronged not only the king but also all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. Her conduct would become known to all women, causing them to despise their husbands and say that King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come. This would lead to widespread disrespect and discord. Memucan suggested that if it pleased the king, a royal decree should be issued and written among the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti should never again enter the presence of King Ahasuerus, and her royal position should be given to someone better than she. The king's edict would be proclaimed throughout his vast realm, ensuring that all women would respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest.

The proposal pleased the king and the nobles, so the king did as Memucan proposed. He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household, using his native tongue.Hege, the king's chamberlain and keeper of the women, was given the task of providing the necessary items for their purification. The king was pleased with the idea of finding a new queen to replace Vashti, and he ordered it to be done.

In the palace of Shushan, there was a Jew named Mordecai, a descendant of Kish, a Benjamite, who had been taken from Jerusalem during the captivity led by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Mordecai had raised his cousin Hadassah, also known as Esther, after her parents died. Esther was beautiful and had a kind nature.

When the king's decree was announced, many young women, including Esther, were brought to the palace and placed under the care of Hegai, the keeper of the women. Esther quickly gained Hegai's favor, and he provided her with the best treatments and seven maids from the king's household. He also gave her the best place in the women's quarters.

Mordecai had instructed Esther not to reveal her Jewish heritage, and she obeyed him. Every day, Mordecai would walk near the courtyard of the women's house to check on Esther's well-being.

When it was each maiden's turn to go to King Ahasuerus, they were given whatever they desired to take with them from the women's house. After spending the night with the king, they would return to a different part of the women's house, overseen by Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain in charge of the concubines. They would not see the king again unless he specifically called for them by name.

When it was Esther's turn, she requested nothing except what Hegai had advised. She found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her. Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, Tebeth, during the seventh year of his reign. The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she won his favor and approval. He placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.

To celebrate, the king held a great feast in Esther's honor and declared a holiday in the provinces, distributing gifts generously. Even after becoming queen, Esther continued to keep her Jewish identity a secret, as Mordecai had instructed.

During this time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate when he overheard two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, plotting to assassinate King Ahasuerus. Mordecai informed Esther, who then reported it to the king in Mordecai's name. After an investigation, the plot was confirmed, and the two conspirators were hanged. This event was recorded in the king's chronicles.

Later, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, elevating him above all the other princes. All the king's servants at the gate bowed to Haman, as the king had commanded, but Mordecai refused to bow. When questioned by the other servants, Mordecai revealed that he was a Jew. This infuriated Haman, who decided not only to punish Mordecai but to destroy all the Jews in the kingdom.

In the first month, Nisan, of the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus's reign, Haman cast lots (Pur) to determine the best day to carry out his plan. He then approached the king, describing the Jews as a people with different laws who did not obey the king's commands, and suggested that it was not in the king's interest to tolerate them. Haman offered to pay ten thousand talents of silver to the king's treasury to fund the destruction of the Jews.

The king gave Haman his signet ring, authorizing him to do as he pleased with the people. On the thirteenth day of the first month, the king's scribes wrote Haman's orders to the governors and rulers of each province, in their own languages, sealing the letters with the king's ring. The letters decreed the destruction, killing, and annihilation of all Jews, young and old, women and children, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, and allowed the plundering of their possessions.

The decree was sent out swiftly, and the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was bewildered.

When Mordecai learned of the decree, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went into the city, wailing loudly. He stopped at the king's gate, as no one in sackcloth was allowed to enter. In every province, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and many lying in sackcloth and ashes.

Esther's maids and chamberlains informed her of Mordecai's distress, and she was deeply troubled. She sent clothes for Mordecai to wear instead of sackcloth, but he refused. Esther then sent Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, to find out what was troubling Mordecai.

Mordecai explained everything to Hatach, including the sum of money Haman had promised to pay for the destruction of the Jews. He gave Hatach a copy of the decree to show Esther and urged her to plead with the king for her people.

Esther replied that anyone who approached the king without being summoned would be put to death unless the king extended his golden scepter. She had not been called to the king for thirty days. Mordecai sent back a message, urging Esther not to think she would escape because she was in the king's house. He warned that if she remained silent, deliverance for the Jews would come from another place, but she and her family would perish. He suggested that perhaps she had become queen for such a time as this.

Esther asked Mordecai to gather all the Jews in Shushan to fast for her for three days and nights. She and her maids would do the same. She resolved to approach the king, even if it meant risking her life, saying, "If I perish, I perish." Mordecai did as Esther requested.Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, facing the throne room. When King Ahasuerus saw her, he was pleased and extended his golden scepter to her. Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. The king asked her what she wanted, promising to grant her request even up to half of his kingdom. Esther invited the king and Haman to a banquet she had prepared.

At the banquet, the king again asked Esther what she desired. She requested that the king and Haman attend another banquet the next day, where she would reveal her petition. Haman left the banquet in high spirits but became furious when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate, refusing to bow. Haman's wife Zeresh and his friends suggested building a gallows to hang Mordecai, and Haman agreed.

That night, the king couldn't sleep and had the royal chronicles read to him. He discovered that Mordecai had saved his life by exposing a plot against him. The king asked what had been done to honor Mordecai and learned that nothing had been done. Just then, Haman entered the court to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai. The king asked Haman how to honor someone he delighted in. Thinking the king meant him, Haman suggested royal robes, a horse, and a public parade. The king ordered Haman to do all this for Mordecai.

Haman had to honor Mordecai publicly, which humiliated him. He returned home in mourning, and his wife and friends warned him that opposing Mordecai would lead to his downfall. While they were talking, the king's chamberlains arrived to bring Haman to Esther's second banquet.

At the banquet, the king again asked Esther what she wanted. She revealed that she and her people were to be destroyed and identified Haman as the enemy. The king, enraged, left the room. Haman begged Esther for his life, but when the king returned and saw Haman falling on Esther's couch, he thought Haman was attacking her. The king ordered Haman to be hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.

The king gave Haman's estate to Esther, and she revealed her relationship to Mordecai. The king gave Mordecai his signet ring, making him a high official. Esther pleaded with the king to revoke Haman's decree against the Jews. The king allowed Mordecai to write a new decree, permitting the Jews to defend themselves. This decree was sent out swiftly, and the Jews prepared to protect themselves.

Mordecai left the king's presence in royal garments, and the city of Shushan rejoiced.Mordecai wore a golden crown and fine linen robes, and the city of Shushan celebrated with joy. The Jews experienced light, gladness, joy, and honor. In every province and city where the king's decree reached, the Jews celebrated with feasts and happiness. Many people converted to Judaism out of fear of the Jews.

On the 13th day of the 12th month (Adar), the Jews' enemies hoped to overpower them, but the opposite happened—the Jews triumphed over those who hated them. They gathered in their cities across King Ahasuerus's provinces to defend themselves, and no one could stand against them because everyone feared them. Even the provincial rulers, lieutenants, deputies, and officers helped the Jews due to their fear of Mordecai, who had become very influential.

The Jews struck down their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them. In Shushan, they killed 500 men, including Haman's ten sons. However, they did not take any plunder. The king informed Esther of the 500 men killed in Shushan and asked her what more she desired. Esther requested that the Jews in Shushan be allowed to continue defending themselves the next day and that Haman's ten sons be hanged. The king agreed, and the decree was issued.

The Jews in Shushan gathered again on the 14th day of Adar and killed 300 more men but took no plunder. Across the provinces, the Jews killed 75,000 of their enemies but did not take any plunder. They celebrated on the 14th and 15th days of Adar with feasting and joy. The Jews in the villages celebrated on the 14th day with gladness, feasting, and exchanging gifts.

Mordecai documented these events and sent letters to all the Jews in King Ahasuerus's provinces, instructing them to celebrate the 14th and 15th days of Adar annually. These days marked their rest from enemies and the transformation of their sorrow into joy. The Jews agreed to observe these days as Mordecai had written, commemorating their deliverance from Haman's plot.

Esther and Mordecai confirmed these days of Purim with authority, and letters were sent to all Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom, promoting peace and truth. The decree of Esther established these matters of Purim, and it was recorded in the book.

King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the islands. The acts of his power and the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king advanced, were recorded in the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia. Mordecai was second to King Ahasuerus, respected among the Jews, and sought the welfare of his people, speaking peace to all his descendants.

In the land of Uz, there was a man named Job who was blameless, upright, feared God, and shunned evil. He had seven sons and three daughters, and his wealth included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a large household, making him the greatest man in the East. His sons would hold feasts, and Job would offer burnt offerings for them, fearing they might have sinned.

One day, the sons of God presented themselves before the LORD, and Satan came among them. The LORD asked Satan where he had come from, and Satan replied that he had been roaming the earth. The LORD asked if Satan had considered Job, a blameless and upright man who feared God and shunned evil. Satan challenged Job's integrity, suggesting that Job was faithful only because of God's protection and blessings. The LORD allowed Satan to test Job by taking away his possessions but not harming him.

On a day when Job's children were feasting, messengers came to Job with news of disasters: the Sabeans had taken his oxen and donkeys and killed his servants, fire from heaven had burned his sheep and servants, the Chaldeans had taken his camels and killed his servants, and a great wind had collapsed the house where his children were, killing them all. Job mourned deeply but did not sin or blame God.Satan came before the LORD, and the LORD asked him where he had been. Satan replied that he had been roaming the earth. The LORD asked if Satan had considered Job, a blameless and upright man who feared God and avoided evil. Despite Satan's attempts to destroy him, Job maintained his integrity. Satan argued that Job would curse God if his health was affected. The LORD allowed Satan to test Job but not to take his life.

Satan afflicted Job with painful sores from head to toe. Job used a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he sat among the ashes. His wife told him to curse God and die, but Job rebuked her, saying they should accept both good and bad from God. Despite his suffering, Job did not sin with his words.

When Job's three friends—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—heard of his troubles, they came to comfort him. They were so shocked by his appearance that they wept, tore their robes, and sprinkled dust on their heads. They sat with him in silence for seven days and nights, seeing how great his suffering was.

Finally, Job spoke, cursing the day of his birth. He wished he had never been born or had died at birth, believing that death would have brought him peace. He lamented his existence and questioned why life was given to those in misery.

Eliphaz responded, reminding Job of his past encouragement to others and suggesting that Job's suffering was a result of his own actions. He argued that no one innocent ever perished and that those who sow trouble reap it. Eliphaz described a vision in which a spirit questioned whether humans could be more righteous than God. He advised Job to seek God, who performs great and unsearchable deeds, and to accept God's correction, as it ultimately leads to healing and deliverance.

Job replied, expressing the weight of his grief and the feeling that God's arrows were within him. He longed for God to end his life, finding comfort in the thought of being released from his suffering. Job questioned his strength and the hope of prolonging his life, feeling abandoned by his friends and forsaken by God.Job continued to express his deep sorrow and frustration. He compared his friends to unreliable streams that dry up when needed most. He felt abandoned and misunderstood by them. Job questioned why he was suffering so much and asked his friends to teach him if he had done wrong. He lamented the fleeting nature of life and the relentless pain he was enduring. Job felt that his days were passing quickly without hope and that he would soon be forgotten.

Bildad, one of Job's friends, responded by questioning how long Job would continue to speak in such a way. He argued that God does not pervert justice and suggested that Job's children had been punished for their sins. Bildad advised Job to seek God and live righteously, promising that God would restore his fortunes if he did so. He encouraged Job to learn from the wisdom of past generations.

Job replied, acknowledging God's immense power and wisdom. He felt that no human could be righteous before God and that it was futile to argue with Him. Job described God's control over nature and the universe, emphasizing that humans are insignificant in comparison. He expressed his despair, feeling that God was against him and that his suffering was undeserved.

Job continued to question why God was allowing him to suffer and asked for an explanation. He felt that God was treating him harshly and unfairly, despite knowing that he was not wicked. Job lamented his creation, wishing he had never been born. He felt that his life was filled with relentless pain and confusion, and he longed for an end to his suffering.Job continued to express his deep sorrow, wishing he had never been born. He lamented the shortness of his life and asked to be left alone to find some comfort before he died. He described the afterlife as a land of darkness and chaos.

Zophar, another of Job's friends, responded by criticizing Job's lengthy complaints. He accused Job of being arrogant and dishonest, suggesting that Job's suffering was less than he deserved. Zophar urged Job to seek God and repent, promising that doing so would bring peace and security.

Job replied, asserting that he was just as wise as his friends and did not deserve their mockery. He pointed out that even the natural world recognizes God's power and justice. Job lamented that the wicked often prosper while the righteous suffer. He emphasized that God is in control of everything, from the rise and fall of nations to the fate of individuals.

Job expressed his desire to speak directly to God and defend his innocence. He criticized his friends for their false accusations and urged them to listen to his reasoning. Job questioned why God was treating him as an enemy and asked for an explanation of his suffering. He acknowledged that human life is short and full of trouble, and he longed for relief from his pain.

Eliphaz, another friend, responded by questioning the value of Job's words and accusing him of undermining piety and prayer. He suggested that Job's own words condemned him and questioned Job's claim to special wisdom. Eliphaz reminded Job that even the wise and aged are not immune to suffering and that God's ways are beyond human understanding."Why are you letting your emotions get the best of you? Why do you speak against God and let such words come out of your mouth? What is man that he should be pure, or anyone born of a woman that he should be righteous? God doesn't even trust His holy ones, and even the heavens aren't pure in His sight. How much more impure is man, who drinks iniquity like water?

Listen to me, and I will share what I have seen, what wise men have passed down from their ancestors. The wicked suffer all their days, and the oppressor's years are hidden. Fear haunts them constantly, and even in prosperity, destruction awaits. They don't believe they will escape darkness; they are destined for the sword. They wander for food, knowing that darkness is near. Trouble and anguish terrify them, overpowering them like a king ready for battle. They stretch out their hands against God and defy the Almighty. They charge at Him with arrogance, covering their faces with fat and living in desolate cities and abandoned houses. They will not be rich, their wealth will not endure, and their prosperity will not last. They will not escape darkness; flames will consume them, and they will be swept away by the breath of God's mouth. Those who trust in vanity will be repaid with vanity. Their branches will wither before their time, and they will cast off their unripe fruit like a vine. The congregation of hypocrites will be desolate, and fire will consume the tents of bribery. They conceive trouble and give birth to evil, and their hearts plot deceit.

Job responded, 'I've heard all this before. You are all miserable comforters. Will your empty words never end? What gives you the right to answer me like this? If our roles were reversed, I could also heap up words against you and shake my head at you. But I would encourage you with my words and try to ease your grief. Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I remain silent, it doesn't help. God has worn me out and devastated my entire household. He has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me. In His anger, He tears me apart and gnashes His teeth at me; my enemy sharpens his eyes upon me. People gape at me with their mouths, strike me on the cheek in scorn, and gather against me. God has handed me over to the ungodly and thrown me into the hands of the wicked. I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me His target; His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and pours out my gall on the ground. He breaks me with wound upon wound and rushes at me like a warrior. I have sewn sackcloth over my skin and buried my horn in the dust. My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes, though my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure.

Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest. Even now, my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high. My friends scorn me, but I pour out my tears to God. I wish someone might plead with God for a man, as one pleads for a friend. For when a few years have passed, I will go the way of no return. My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me. Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility. Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me? You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore, you will not let them triumph. If anyone denounces their friends for reward, the eyes of their children will fail. God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit. My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow. The upright are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly. Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.

But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you. My days have passed, my plans are shattered, yet the desires of my heart turn night into day; in the face of darkness, light is near. If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in the realm of darkness, if I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or 'My sister,' where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me? Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?

Then Bildad the Shuhite replied, 'When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk. Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight? You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place? The lamp of a wicked man is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning. The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out. The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down. His feet thrust him into a net; he wanders into its mesh. A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast. A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path. Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step. Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls. It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs. He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors. Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling. His roots dry up below, and his branches wither above. The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land. He is driven from light into the realm of darkness and is banished from the world. He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived. People of the west are appalled at his fate; those of the east are seized with horror. Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who does not know God.'

Then Job replied, 'How long will you torment me and crush me with words? Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me. If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone. If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me, then know that God has wronged me and drawn His net around me. Though I cry, 'Violence!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice. He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has shrouded my paths in darkness. He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head. He tears me down on every side till I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree. His anger burns against me; He counts me among His enemies. His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.

He has alienated my family from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. My relatives have gone away; my closest friends have forgotten me. My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner; they look on me as a stranger. I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth. My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own family. Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me. All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me. I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth. Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me. Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?

Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll, that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever! I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end, He will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh, I will see God; I myself will see Him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!""Why do you keep persecuting me, saying the root of the problem is within me? Be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings punishment by the sword, so you may know there is judgment."

Then Zophar the Naamathite replied, "My thoughts compel me to respond quickly. I've heard your insults, and my understanding drives me to answer. Don't you know that since the beginning of time, the triumph of the wicked is short-lived, and the joy of hypocrites lasts only a moment? Even if their pride reaches the heavens and their heads touch the clouds, they will perish forever like their own waste. Those who saw them will ask, 'Where are they?' They will vanish like a dream, chased away like a vision of the night. The eye that saw them will see them no more, and their place will remember them no longer. Their children will seek to please the poor, and they will have to return their ill-gotten gains. Their bones, full of youthful sin, will lie down with them in the dust. Though evil tastes sweet in their mouths and they hide it under their tongues, though they cherish it and do not let it go, it will turn sour in their stomachs, becoming the venom of serpents within them. They will vomit up the riches they swallowed; God will force them out of their bellies. They will suck the poison of serpents; the viper's tongue will kill them. They will not enjoy the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and cream. They will give back what they labored for and will not enjoy it; their restitution will match their wealth, and they will not rejoice in it. Because they oppressed and abandoned the poor, and seized houses they did not build, they will know no peace within. They will not save anything they desire. Nothing will be left for them to devour; their prosperity will not endure. In the midst of their plenty, distress will overtake them; the full force of misery will come upon them. When they are about to fill their stomachs, God will unleash His fury upon them and rain it down while they are eating. They will flee from an iron weapon, only to be struck down by a bronze arrow. The arrow will pierce their bodies, and terror will grip them. Total darkness will be hidden in their secret places; a fire not fanned will consume them, and calamity will overtake them. The heavens will expose their guilt, and the earth will rise up against them. Their wealth will vanish in the day of God's wrath. This is the fate God has reserved for the wicked, the heritage appointed to them by God."

Then Job replied, "How long will you torment me and crush me with words? Ten times now you have insulted me; you shamelessly attack me. If I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone. If you want to exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me, know that God has wronged me and trapped me in His net. Though I cry 'Violence!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice. He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has shrouded my paths in darkness. He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head. He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree. His anger burns against me; He counts me among His enemies. His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.

I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end, He will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh, I will see God; I myself will see Him with my own eyes—I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!""That's why I'm troubled in His presence; when I think about it, I get scared. God makes my heart soft and troubles me. He didn't cut me off before the darkness came, nor did He hide the darkness from me. Why, if times are not hidden from the Almighty, do those who know Him not see His days? Some people move boundary stones, steal flocks, and feed on them. They take the donkey of the fatherless and seize the widow's ox as collateral. They push the needy off the path, and the poor of the earth hide together. Like wild donkeys in the desert, they go out to their work, searching for food; the wilderness provides food for them and their children. They harvest their grain in the field and gather the grapes of the wicked. They force the naked to sleep without clothing, leaving them without a covering in the cold. They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter. They snatch the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge from the poor. They make them go about naked without clothing and take away the sheaves from the hungry. They press oil within their walls and tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst. People groan from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out, but God charges no one with wrongdoing. These are those who rebel against the light; they do not know its ways nor stay in its paths. The murderer rises with the light, kills the poor and needy, and at night becomes a thief. The adulterer waits for twilight, thinking no one will see him, and disguises his face. In the dark, they break into houses they marked for themselves in the daytime; they do not know the light. For the morning is to them like the shadow of death; if someone recognizes them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. They are swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; they do not turn towards the vineyards. Drought and heat consume the snow waters, so does the grave those who have sinned. The womb forgets them; the worm feasts on them; they are no longer remembered, and wickedness is broken like a tree. They prey on the barren woman who does not bear and do no good to the widow. He drags off the mighty with His power; they rise up, and no one is sure of life. He gives them security, and they rest on it, yet His eyes are on their ways. They are exalted for a little while, but then they are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way like all others and cut off like the tops of the ears of grain. If this is not so, who will prove me a liar and make my speech worth nothing?"

Then Bildad the Shuhite replied, "Dominion and awe belong to Him; He establishes peace in His high places. Can His armies be numbered? Upon whom does His light not rise? How then can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of a woman be pure? Even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in His eyes. How much less a mortal, who is but a maggot—a human being, who is only a worm!"

But Job answered, "How have you helped the powerless? How have you saved the arm that has no strength? How have you counseled the unwise and provided sound advice? To whom have you uttered these words, and whose spirit spoke from your mouth? The dead tremble beneath the waters and their inhabitants. The realm of the dead is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered. He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; He suspends the earth over nothing. He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight. He covers the face of the full moon, spreading His clouds over it. He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness. The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at His rebuke. By His power, He churned up the sea; by His wisdom, He cut Rahab to pieces. By His breath, the skies became fair; His hand pierced the gliding serpent. And these are but the outer fringe of His works; how faint the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?"

Job continued his discourse, "As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made my life bitter, as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils, my lips will not say anything wicked, and my tongue will not utter lies. I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity. I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live. May my enemy be like the wicked, my adversary like the unjust! For what hope have the godless when they are cut off, when God takes away their life? Does God listen to their cry when distress comes upon them? Will they find delight in the Almighty? Will they call on God at all times? I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal. You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk? Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty: However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat. The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them. Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay, what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver. The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman. He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone. Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night. The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power. It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place."

"Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined. Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore. Mortals put an end to the darkness; they search out the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness. Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft, in places untouched by human feet; far from other people they dangle and sway. The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire; lapis lazuli comes from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold. No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it. Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there. People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains. They tunnel through the rock; their eyes see all its treasures. They search the sources of the rivers and bring hidden things to light. But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell? No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living. The deep says, 'It is not in me'; the sea says, 'It is not with me.' It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver. It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or lapis lazuli. Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold. Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies. The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold. Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell? It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds in the sky. Destruction and Death say, 'Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.' God understands the way to it and He alone knows where it dwells, for He views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. When He established the force of the wind and measured out the waters, when He made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm, then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He confirmed it and tested it. And He said to the human race, 'The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.'"

Job continued his discourse, "How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me, when His lamp shone on my head and by His light I walked through darkness! Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house, when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me, when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil. When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square, the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet; the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands; the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths. Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me, because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist them.""I helped the poor who cried out and the orphans who had no one to assist them. Those who were on the brink of death blessed me, and I made the widow's heart sing for joy. I wore righteousness like a garment; my decisions were like a robe and a crown. I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame. I was a father to the needy and investigated the cases of strangers. I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth. I thought, 'I will die in my own home, and my days will be as numerous as the grains of sand.' My roots will reach the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches. My glory will remain fresh within me, and my bow will be ever new in my hand. People listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel. After I spoke, they had nothing to add; my words fell gently on their ears. They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words like the spring rain. When I smiled at them, they could hardly believe it; the light of my face was precious to them. I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.

But now those younger than I mock me, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheepdogs. What use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them? Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night. In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom bush. They were banished from human society, shouted at as if they were thieves. They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground. They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth. A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land. And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them. They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence. On my right, the rabble rise; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me. They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me. 'No one can help him,' they say. They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins, they come rolling in. Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.

And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me. Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest. In his great power, God becomes like clothing to me; he binds me like the neck of my garment. He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes. I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me. You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand, you attack me. You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm. I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.

Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress. Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor? Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness. The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me. I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help. I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls. My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever. My lyre is tuned to mourning, and my pipe to the sound of wailing.

I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a young woman. For what is our lot from God above, our heritage from the Almighty on high? Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong? Does he not see my ways and count my every step? If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit—let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless—if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled, then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.

If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door, then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her. For that would have been wicked, a sin to be judged. It is a fire that burns to Destruction; it would have uprooted my harvest. If I have denied justice to any of my servants, whether male or female, when they had a grievance against me, what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account? Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?

If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary, if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless—but from my youth I reared them as a father would, and from my birth I guided the widow—if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or the needy without garments, and their hearts did not bless me for warming them with the fleece from my sheep, if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court, then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint. For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.

If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,' if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained, if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor, so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage, then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.

If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him—I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against their life—if those of my household have never said, 'Who has not been filled with Job's meat?'—but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler—if I have concealed my sin as people do, by hiding my guilt in my heart because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside—(Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing. Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown. I would give him an account of my every step; I would present it to him as to a ruler.)—if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears, if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants, then let briers come up instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley."

The words of Job are ended.

So these three men stopped answering Job because he was righteous in his own eyes. But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. He was also angry with the three friends because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he. But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.

So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know. I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.' But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding. It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right. Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know. I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words, I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments. Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God, not a man, refute him.' But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.

They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them. Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply? I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know. For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me; inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst. I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply. I will show no partiality, nor will I flatter anyone; for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.

But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say. I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue. My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.""Listen to my words, Job, and pay attention to everything I say. I am about to speak from a sincere heart, and my lips will clearly express what I know. The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. If you can answer me, prepare your words and stand up. I am just like you before God; I too was formed from clay. Don't be afraid of me, and my hand will not be heavy upon you.

You have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard your words: 'I am pure, without sin; I am innocent and free from guilt. Yet God finds reasons to oppose me and considers me His enemy. He puts my feet in shackles and watches all my paths.' But you are not right in this, and I will answer you: God is greater than any human. Why do you argue with Him? He does not have to explain His actions to anyone. God speaks in various ways, but people often do not perceive it. He may speak in a dream or a vision at night when people are in deep sleep. He opens their ears and gives them instructions to turn them from wrongdoing and keep them from pride. He spares their souls from the pit and their lives from perishing by the sword.

People may be disciplined with pain on their beds and with constant distress in their bones, so that they lose their appetite for food and their flesh wastes away. Their bones, once hidden, now stick out. They draw near to the grave, and their lives approach the destroyers. But if there is an angel, a mediator, one among a thousand, to tell them what is right, then God is gracious to them and says, 'Deliver them from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom.' Their flesh is renewed like a child's; they are restored to the days of their youth. They pray to God and find favor with Him; they see His face and shout for joy, and He restores them to righteousness. They acknowledge their sin and say, 'I have sinned and perverted what was right, but it did not profit me.' God redeems their soul from the pit, and they see the light.

God does all these things to people, often bringing them back from the pit to enlighten them with the light of life. Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want to vindicate you. If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."

Elihu continued, "Listen to my words, you wise men; pay attention to me, you who have knowledge. The ear tests words as the tongue tastes food. Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good. Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice. Although I am right, I am considered a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.' What person is like Job, who drinks scorn like water? He keeps company with evildoers and associates with the wicked. For he says, 'It profits a person nothing to delight in God.'

So listen to me, you who have understanding: Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong. He repays everyone for what they have done; He brings on them what their conduct deserves. It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice. Who appointed Him over the earth? Who put Him in charge of the whole world? If He decided to withdraw His spirit and breath, all humanity would perish together, and people would return to dust.

If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One? Is it right to say to a king, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked'? God shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of His hands. They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand. His eyes are on the ways of mortals; He sees their every step. There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness, where evildoers can hide. God has no need to examine people further, that they should come before Him for judgment. Without inquiry, He shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place. Because He takes note of their deeds, He overthrows them in the night, and they are crushed. He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them, because they turned from following Him and had no regard for any of His ways. They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, so that He heard the cry of the needy. When He is silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He is over individuals and nations alike, to keep the godless from ruling, from laying snares for the people.

Suppose someone says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more. Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.' Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know. Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me, 'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.' Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man! To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."

Elihu continued, "Do you think this is just? You say, 'I am in the right, not God.' Yet you ask Him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?' I will answer you and your friends with you. Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you. If you sin, how does that affect God? If your sins are many, what does that do to Him? If you are righteous, what do you give to Him, or what does He receive from your hand? Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself, and your righteousness only other people.

People cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful. But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?' They cry out, but He does not answer, because of the arrogance of the wicked. Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it. How much less, then, will He listen when you say that you do not see Him, that your case is before Him, and you must wait for Him, and further, that His anger never punishes and He does not take the least notice of wickedness. So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge, he multiplies words."

Elihu continued, "Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf. I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker. Be assured that my words are not false; one who has perfect knowledge is with you.

God is mighty, but despises no one; He is mighty and firm in His purpose. He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights. He does not take His eyes off the righteous; He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever. But if people are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction, He tells them what they have done—that they have sinned arrogantly. He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil. If they obey and serve Him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment. But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.

The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He fetters them, they do not cry for help. They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines. But He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; He saves them from the clutches of the powerful. So He opens their ears to warning and commands them to turn from wrongdoing. If they obey and serve Him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment. But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.

But He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; He saves them from the clutches of the powerful. So He opens their ears to warning and commands them to turnListen to the sound of His voice, the thunder that echoes from His mouth. He directs it across the sky, and His lightning reaches the ends of the earth. After the lightning, His voice roars—He thunders with majestic power, and nothing can stop it. God’s voice is awe-inspiring; He does great things beyond our understanding. He commands the snow to fall on the earth and the rain to pour down. He stops everyone from working so that all people may recognize His deeds. The animals retreat to their dens and stay in their lairs. The storm comes from the south, and the cold from the north. By His breath, ice forms, and the waters freeze. He loads the clouds with moisture and scatters His lightning through them. They swirl around, turning according to His plans, to do whatever He commands on the earth. He brings the clouds to punish people or to water His land and show His love.

Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God’s wonders. Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes His lightning flash? Do you understand how the clouds hang in the sky, the wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge? You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind, can you join Him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze? Tell us what we should say to Him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness. Should He be told that I want to speak? Would anyone ask to be swallowed up? Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean. Out of the north, He comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty. The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in His justice and great righteousness, He does not oppress. Therefore, people revere Him, for does He not have regard for all the wise in heart?

Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm. He said: "Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge? Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell me if you understand. Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy? Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness, when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place, when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt’? Have you ever given orders to the morning or shown the dawn its place, that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it? The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment. The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken. Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep? Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness? Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me if you know all this. What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside? Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings? Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years! Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail, which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle? What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth? Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain and a path for the thunderstorm, to water a land where no one lives, an uninhabited desert, to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass? Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew? From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen? Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades? Can you loosen Orion’s belt? Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs? Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God’s dominion over the earth? Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water? Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’? Who gives the ibis wisdom or gives the rooster understanding? Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together? Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket? Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food? Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn? Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth? They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended. Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return. Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied its ropes? I gave it the wasteland as its home, the salt flats as its habitat. It laughs at the commotion in the town; it does not hear a driver’s shout. It ranges the hills for its pasture and searches for any green thing. Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will it stay by your manger at night? Can you hold it to the furrow with a harness? Will it till the valleys behind you? Will you rely on it for its great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to it? Can you trust it to haul in your grain and bring it to your threshing floor? The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, though they cannot compare with the wings and feathers of the stork. She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand, unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them. She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain, for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense. Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider. Do you give the horse its strength or clothe its neck with a flowing mane? Do you make it leap like a locust, striking terror with its proud snorting? It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its strength, and charges into the fray. It laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; it does not shy away from the sword. The quiver rattles against its side, along with the flashing spear and lance. In frenzied excitement, it eats up the ground; it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds. At the blast of the trumpet, it snorts, ‘Aha!’ It catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry. Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread its wings toward the south? Does the eagle soar at your command and build its nest on high? It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is its stronghold. From there it looks for food; its eyes detect it from afar. Its young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there it is.”"Adorn yourself with majesty and splendor; clothe yourself in glory and beauty. Unleash your fury; look at the proud and humble them. Bring down the wicked where they stand. Bury them in the dust together; shroud their faces in darkness. Then I will admit that your own strength can save you.

Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. It eats grass like an ox. Its strength is in its hips, and its power is in the muscles of its belly. Its tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are tightly knit. Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron. It ranks first among the works of God, yet its Maker can approach it with His sword. The hills bring it their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby. It lies under the lotus plants, hidden among the reeds in the marsh. The lotuses conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround it. It is not alarmed by the raging river; it is confident even when the Jordan rushes against its mouth. Can anyone capture it by the eyes, or trap it and pierce its nose?

Can you catch Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down its tongue with a rope? Can you put a cord through its nose or pierce its jaw with a hook? Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak to you with gentle words? Will it make an agreement with you for you to take it as your slave for life? Can you make a pet of it like a bird or put it on a leash for the young women in your house? Will traders barter for it? Will they divide it up among the merchants? Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears? If you lay a hand on it, you will remember the struggle and never do it again! Any hope of subduing it is false; the mere sight of it is overpowering. No one is fierce enough to rouse it. Who then is able to stand against me? Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.

I will not fail to speak of Leviathan’s limbs, its strength, and its graceful form. Who can strip off its outer coat? Who can penetrate its double coat of armor? Who dares open the doors of its mouth, ringed with fearsome teeth? Its back has rows of shields tightly sealed together; each is so close to the next that no air can pass between. They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted. Its snorting throws out flashes of light; its eyes are like the rays of dawn. Flames stream from its mouth; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke pours from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds. Its breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from its mouth. Strength resides in its neck; dismay goes before it. The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable. Its chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone. When it rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before its thrashing. The sword that reaches it has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin. Iron it treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood. Arrows do not make it flee; slingstones are like chaff to it. A club seems to it but a piece of straw; it laughs at the rattling of the lance. Its undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge. It makes the depths churn like a boiling cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment. It leaves a glistening wake behind it; one would think the deep had white hair. Nothing on earth is its equal—a creature without fear. It looks down on all that are haughty; it is king over all that are proud."

Then Job replied to the LORD: "I know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted. You asked, 'Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know. You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.' My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."

After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends because you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has. So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has." So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.

After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before. All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring. The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the former part. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys. And he also had seven sons and three daughters. The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-Happuch. Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers. After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. And so Job died, an old man and full of years.Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for I pray to you. Every morning, you will hear my voice; I will lay my requests before you and wait expectantly. You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you, the wicked cannot dwell. The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong. You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD detests bloodthirsty and deceitful people. But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence, I will bow down toward your holy temple. Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies—make your way straight before me. Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with malice. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues, they tell lies. Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you. Surely, LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath. Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am faint; heal me, LORD, for my bones are in agony. My soul is in deep anguish. How long, LORD, how long? Turn, LORD, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love. Among the dead, no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave? I am worn out from my groaning. All night long, I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears. My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes. Away from me, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping. The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer. All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.

LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me, or they will tear me apart like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me. LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands—if I have repaid my ally with evil or without cause have robbed my foe—then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust. Arise, LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice. Let the assembled peoples gather around you while you sit enthroned over them on high. Let the LORD judge the peoples. Vindicate me, LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High. Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure—you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts. My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart. God is a righteous judge, a God who displays his wrath every day. If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows. Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment. Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have made. The trouble they cause recoils on them; their violence comes down on their own heads. I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness; I will sing the praises of the name of the LORD Most High.

LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens. Through the praise of children and infants, you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them? You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor. You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet: all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas. LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!

I will give thanks to you, LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds. I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High. My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you. For you have upheld my right and my cause, sitting enthroned as the righteous judge. You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name forever and ever. Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished. The LORD reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment. He rules the world in righteousness and judges the peoples with equity. The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. Those who know your name trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you. Sing the praises of the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done. For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted. LORD, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death, that I may declare your praises in the gates of Daughter Zion, and there rejoice in your salvation. The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden. The LORD is known by his acts of justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God. But God will never forget the needy; the hope of the afflicted will never perish. Arise, LORD, do not let mortals triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence. Strike them with terror, LORD; let the nations know they are only mortal.

Why, LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? In his arrogance, the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises. He boasts about the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD. In his pride, the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts, there is no room for God. His ways are always prosperous; your laws are rejected by him; he sneers at all his enemies. He says to himself, "Nothing will ever shake me." He swears, "No one will ever do me harm." His mouth is full of lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue. He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush, he murders the innocent. His eyes watch in secret for his victims; like a lion in cover, he lies in wait. He lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net. His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength. He says to himself, "God will never notice; he covers his face and never sees." Arise, LORD! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless. Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, "He won't call me to account"? But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless. Break the arm of the wicked man; call the evildoer to account for his wickedness that would not otherwise be found out. The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations will perish from his land. You, LORD, hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror.

In the LORD, I take refuge. How then can you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your mountain. For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?" The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes everyone on earth; his eyes examine them. The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion. On the wicked, he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot. For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice; the upright will see his face.

Help, LORD, for no one is faithful anymore; those who are loyal have vanished from the human race. Everyone lies to their neighbor; they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts. May the LORD silence all flattering lips and every boastful tongue—those who say, "By our tongues we will prevail; our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?" "Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD. "I will protect them from those who malign them.""I will rise up," says the LORD, "and protect him from those who mock him." The words of the LORD are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times. You, LORD, will keep them safe and protect them from this generation forever. The wicked prowl on every side when the vilest people are exalted.

How long, LORD, will you forget me? Forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and have sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy triumph over me? Look on me and answer, LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death, and my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall. But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation. I will sing the LORD's praise, for he has been good to me.

The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good. The LORD looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the LORD. But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous. You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge. Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!

LORD, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain? The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart; whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor, and casts no slur on others; who despises a vile person but honors those who fear the LORD; who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change their mind; who lends money to the poor without interest; who does not accept a bribe against the innocent. Whoever does these things will never be shaken.

Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge. I say to the LORD, "You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing." I say of the holy people who are in the land, "They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight." Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more. I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods or take up their names on my lips. LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure. The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken. Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure, because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay. You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.

Hear me, LORD, my plea is just; listen to my cry. Hear my prayer—it does not rise from deceitful lips. Let my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right. Though you probe my heart, though you examine me at night and test me, you will find that I have planned no evil; my mouth has not transgressed. Though people tried to bribe me, I have kept myself from the ways of the violent through what your lips have commanded. My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not stumbled. I call on you, my God, for you will answer me; turn your ear to me and hear my prayer. Show me the wonders of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes. Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings from the wicked who are out to destroy me, from my mortal enemies who surround me. They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance. They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert to throw me to the ground. They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a fierce lion crouching in cover. Rise up, LORD, confront them, bring them down; with your sword rescue me from the wicked. By your hand save me from such people, LORD, from those of this world whose reward is in this life. May what you have stored up for the wicked fill their bellies; may their children gorge themselves on it, and may there be leftovers for their little ones. As for me, I will be vindicated and will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.

I love you, LORD, my strength. The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. I called to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I have been saved from my enemies. The cords of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me. In my distress, I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple, he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears. The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it. He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet. He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind. He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him—the dark rain clouds of the sky. Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning. The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning he routed them. The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, LORD, at the blast of breath from your nostrils. He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters. He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me. They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support. He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me. The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I am not guilty of turning from my God. All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees. I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin. The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. To the faithful, you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless, to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the devious you show yourself shrewd. You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty. You, LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light. With your help, I can advance against a troop; with my God, I can scale a wall. As for God, his way is perfect: The LORD's word is flawless; he shields all who take refuge in him. For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God? It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure. He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he causes me to stand on the heights. He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. You make your saving help my shield, and your right hand sustains me; your help has made me great. You provide a broad path for my feet so that my ankles do not give way. I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed. I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet. You armed me with strength for battle; you humbled my adversaries before me. You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes. They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—to the LORD, but he did not answer. I beat them as fine as windblown dust; I trampled them like mud in the streets. You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations. People I did not know now serve me, foreigners cower before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me. They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds. The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior! He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me, who saves me from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from a violent man, you rescued me. Therefore I will praise you, LORD, among the nations; I will sing the praises of your name.Sing praises to the Lord among the nations and celebrate His name. He grants great deliverance to His king and shows mercy to His chosen one, David, and his descendants forever.

The heavens showcase God's glory, and the skies display His craftsmanship. Each day speaks, and each night reveals knowledge. There is no speech or language where their voice isn't heard. Their message has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. God has set a home for the sun in them, which emerges like a bridegroom from his chamber and rejoices like a strong man running a race. The sun rises from one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.

The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul. The testimony of the Lord is trustworthy, making the simple wise. The statutes of the Lord are right, bringing joy to the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. They are more desirable than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. By them, your servant is warned, and in keeping them, there is great reward.

Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from secret faults. Keep your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not rule over me. Then I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob defend you. May He send you help from the sanctuary and strengthen you out of Zion. May He remember all your offerings and accept your burnt sacrifice. May He grant you according to your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans. We will rejoice in your salvation and in the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May the Lord fulfill all your petitions.

Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed; He will hear him from His holy heaven with the saving strength of His right hand. Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. They have bowed down and fallen, but we have risen and stand upright. Save, Lord! May the King answer us when we call.

The king shall rejoice in your strength, O Lord, and in your salvation, how greatly shall he rejoice! You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. You have met him with the blessings of goodness and set a crown of pure gold on his head. He asked life from you, and you gave it to him—length of days forever and ever. His glory is great in your salvation; you have bestowed honor and majesty upon him. For you have made him most blessed forever; you have made him exceedingly glad with your presence. For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High, he shall not be moved.

Your hand will find all your enemies; your right hand will find those who hate you. You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger. The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them. You shall destroy their descendants from the earth and their offspring from among the children of men. For they intended evil against you; they devised a plot which they are not able to perform. Therefore, you will make them turn their back when you aim your arrows at their faces. Be exalted, O Lord, in your own strength! We will sing and praise your power.

My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me and from the words of my groaning? O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not hear; and in the night season, and am not silent. But you are holy, enthroned in the praises of Israel. Our fathers trusted in you; they trusted, and you delivered them. They cried to you and were delivered; they trusted in you and were not ashamed. But I am a worm and no man, a reproach of men and despised by the people. All those who see me ridicule me; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, "He trusted in the Lord, let Him rescue him; let Him deliver him since He delights in him."

But you are He who took me out of the womb; you made me trust while on my mother's breasts. I was cast upon you from birth. From my mother's womb, you have been my God. Be not far from me, for trouble is near, for there is none to help. Many bulls have surrounded me; strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me. They gape at me with their mouths, like a raging and roaring lion. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it has melted within me. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue clings to my jaws. You have brought me to the dust of death. For dogs have surrounded me; the congregation of the wicked has enclosed me. They pierced my hands and my feet. I can count all my bones. They look and stare at me. They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing, they cast lots.

But you, O Lord, do not be far from me; O my strength, hasten to help me. Deliver me from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog. Save me from the lion's mouth and from the horns of the wild oxen! You have answered me. I will declare your name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly, I will praise you. You who fear the Lord, praise Him! All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him, and fear Him, all you offspring of Israel! For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; nor has He hidden His face from him; but when he cried to Him, He heard.

My praise shall be of you in the great assembly; I will pay my vows before those who fear Him. The humble shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek the Lord shall praise Him. Your heart shall live forever. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you. For the kingdom is the Lord's, and He rules over the nations. All the prosperous of the earth shall eat and worship; all those who go down to the dust shall bow before Him, even he who cannot keep himself alive. A posterity shall serve Him. It will be recounted of the Lord to the next generation. They will come and declare His righteousness to a people who will be born, that He has done this.

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

The earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness, the world and those who dwell therein. For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters. Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to an idol, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is Jacob, the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face. Selah.

Lift up your heads, O you gates! And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O you gates! Lift up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah.

To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul. O my God, I trust in you; let me not be ashamed; let not my enemies triumph over me. Indeed, let no one who waits on you be ashamed; let those be ashamed who deal treacherously without cause. Show me your ways, O Lord; teach me your paths. Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; on you, I wait all the day. Remember, O Lord, your tender mercies and your lovingkindnesses, for they have been from of old. Do not remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to your mercy remember me, for your goodness' sake, O Lord. Good and upright is the Lord; therefore, He teaches sinners in the way. The humble He guides in justice, and the humble He teaches His way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth to such as keep His covenant and His testimonies. For your name's sake, O Lord, pardon my iniquity, for it is great. Who is the man that fears the Lord? Him shall He teach in the way He chooses. He himself shall dwell in prosperity, and his descendants shall inherit the earth. The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him, and He will show them His covenant. My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for He shall pluck my feet out of the net. Turn yourself to me and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted. The troubles of my heart have enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.Look at my suffering and pain; forgive all my sins. Consider my many enemies and their cruel hatred. Protect my soul and save me; let me not be ashamed, for I trust in you. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait on you. Redeem Israel, O God, from all their troubles.

Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity and trusted in you without wavering. Examine and test me, LORD; evaluate my heart and mind. Your lovingkindness is always before me, and I walk in your truth. I do not associate with deceitful people or hypocrites. I hate the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked. I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, LORD, proclaiming thanksgiving and telling of your wondrous works. LORD, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory dwells. Do not take my soul away with sinners or my life with bloodthirsty men, whose hands are full of wicked schemes and bribes. But I will walk in my integrity; redeem me and be merciful to me. My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly, I will bless the LORD.

The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, my enemies and foes, came upon me to devour my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an army encamps against me, my heart will not fear; though war rises against me, I will be confident. One thing I have desired of the LORD, that I will seek: to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his temple. In times of trouble, he will hide me in his shelter; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent and set me high upon a rock. Now my head will be lifted above my enemies around me, and I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent; I will sing and make music to the LORD.

Hear my voice when I call, LORD; be merciful and answer me. My heart says of you, "Seek his face!" Your face, LORD, I will seek. Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my helper; do not reject or forsake me, O God of my salvation. Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me. Teach me your way, LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors. Do not hand me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence. I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.

To you, LORD, I call; my Rock, do not be deaf to me. If you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit. Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak peace to their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts. Repay them for their deeds and their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back on them what they deserve. Because they do not regard the works of the LORD or the deeds of his hands, he will tear them down and never build them up again. Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy. The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him. The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.

Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness. The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD thunders over the mighty waters. The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic. The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. He makes Lebanon leap like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox. The voice of the LORD strikes with flashes of lightning. The voice of the LORD shakes the desert; the LORD shakes the Desert of Kadesh. The voice of the LORD twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry, "Glory!" The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever. The LORD gives strength to his people; the LORD blesses his people with peace.

I will exalt you, LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me. LORD my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me. LORD, you brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit. Sing the praises of the LORD, you his faithful people; praise his holy name. For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning. When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken." LORD, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed. To you, LORD, I called; to the LORD, I cried for mercy: "What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness? Hear, LORD, and be merciful to me; LORD, be my help." You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. LORD my God, I will praise you forever.

In you, LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness. Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me. Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me. Keep me free from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge. Into your hands I commit my spirit; deliver me, LORD, my faithful God. I hate those who cling to worthless idols; as for me, I trust in the LORD. I will be glad and rejoice in your love, for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul. You have not given me into the hands of the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place. Be merciful to me, LORD, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, my soul and body with grief. My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails because of my affliction, and my bones grow weak. Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors and an object of dread to my closest friends—those who see me on the street flee from me. I am forgotten as though I were dead; I have become like broken pottery. For I hear many whispering, "Terror on every side!" They conspire against me and plot to take my life. But I trust in you, LORD; I say, "You are my God." My times are in your hands; deliver me from the hands of my enemies, from those who pursue me. Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love. Let me not be put to shame, LORD, for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and be silent in the realm of the dead. Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous. How abundant are the good things that you have stored up for those who fear you, that you bestow in the sight of all, on those who take refuge in you. In the shelter of your presence, you hide them from all human intrigues; you keep them safe in your dwelling from accusing tongues. Praise be to the LORD, for he showed me the wonders of his love when I was in a city under siege. In my alarm, I said, "I am cut off from your sight!" Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help. Love the LORD, all his faithful people! The LORD preserves those who are true to him, but the proud he pays back in full. Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the LORD.

Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the one whose sin the LORD does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit. When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD." And you forgave the guilt of my sin. Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them. You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance."I will guide you and teach you the right path to take. Don't be stubborn like a horse or mule that needs a bit and bridle to be controlled. The wicked will face many troubles, but those who trust in the LORD will be surrounded by mercy. Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, all you who are righteous; shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.

Celebrate the LORD, you righteous ones; praise is fitting for the upright. Praise the LORD with musical instruments; sing to Him a new song and play skillfully with a loud noise. The word of the LORD is true, and all His works are done in faithfulness. He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of His goodness. By the word of the LORD, the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of His mouth. He gathers the waters of the sea together and stores them in the depths. Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm. The LORD nullifies the plans of the nations; He thwarts the schemes of the peoples. The plans of the LORD stand firm forever, the purposes of His heart through all generations. Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He chose for His inheritance. The LORD looks down from heaven and sees all mankind; from His dwelling place, He watches all who live on earth. He forms the hearts of all and considers everything they do. No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength. A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its strength, it cannot save. But the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him, on those whose hope is in His unfailing love, to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine. We wait in hope for the LORD; He is our help and our shield. In Him, our hearts rejoice, for we trust in His holy name. May Your unfailing love be with us, LORD, even as we put our hope in You.

I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips. My soul will boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad. Magnify the LORD with me; let us exalt His name together. I sought the LORD, and He answered me; He delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to Him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame. This poor man called, and the LORD heard him; He saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and He delivers them. Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in Him. Fear the LORD, you His holy people, for those who fear Him lack nothing. The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing. Come, my children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days, keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies. Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are attentive to their cry. But the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to blot out their name from the earth. The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; He delivers them from all their troubles. The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. The righteous person may have many troubles, but the LORD delivers him from them all; He protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken. Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned. The LORD will rescue His servants; no one who takes refuge in Him will be condemned.

Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me. Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid. Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to me, 'I am your salvation.' May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay. May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away. May their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them. Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me, may ruin overtake them by surprise—may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin. Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and delight in His salvation. My whole being will exclaim, 'Who is like You, LORD? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them.' False witnesses rise up; they ask me things I do not know. They repay me evil for good and leave me like one bereaved. Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered, I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother. But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; assailants gathered against me without my knowledge. They slandered me without ceasing. Like the ungodly, they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me. How long, Lord, will You look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these lions. I will give You thanks in the great assembly; among the throngs I will praise You. Do not let those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; do not let those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye. They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land. They sneer at me and say, 'Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it.' LORD, You have seen this; do not be silent. Do not be far from me, Lord. Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord. Vindicate me in Your righteousness, LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me. Do not let them think, 'Aha, just what we wanted!' or say, 'We have swallowed him up.' May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace. May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, 'The LORD be exalted, who delights in the well-being of His servant.' My tongue will proclaim Your righteousness, Your praises all day long.

I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before their eyes. In their own eyes, they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin. The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good. Even on their beds, they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong. Your love, LORD, reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the skies. Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, Your justice like the great deep. You, LORD, preserve both people and animals. How priceless is Your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of Your wings. They feast on the abundance of Your house; You give them drink from Your river of delights. For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light, we see light. Continue Your love to those who know You, Your righteousness to the upright in heart. May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. See how the evildoers lie fallen—thrown down, not able to rise.

Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong; for like the grass, they will soon wither, like green plants, they will soon die away. Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. Take delight in the LORD, and He will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD; trust in Him, and He will do this: He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn, your vindication like the noonday sun. Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret—it leads only to evil. For those who are evil will be destroyed, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy peace and prosperity. The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them; but the LORD laughs at the wicked, for He knows their day is coming."The wicked have drawn their swords and bent their bows to bring down the poor and needy and to kill those who live uprightly. But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. A little that a righteous person has is better than the wealth of many wicked people. The Lord will break the power of the wicked but uphold the righteous. The Lord knows the days of the upright, and their inheritance will last forever. They will not be ashamed in difficult times; in days of famine, they will be satisfied. But the wicked will perish, and the enemies of the Lord will vanish like the beauty of the fields; they will disappear like smoke. The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous are generous and give. Those blessed by the Lord will inherit the land, but those cursed by Him will be cut off. The Lord directs the steps of the godly; He delights in every detail of their lives. Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand. I have been young, and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging for bread. The righteous are always generous and lend freely; their children will be a blessing. Turn from evil and do good, and you will live in the land forever. For the Lord loves justice and will not abandon His faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the children of the wicked will be cut off. The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, and their tongues speak what is just. The law of their God is in their hearts; their feet do not slip. The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking to kill them, but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked or let them be condemned when brought to trial. Wait for the Lord and keep His way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it. I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a luxuriant native tree, but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found. Consider the blameless, observe the upright; a future awaits those who seek peace. But all sinners will be destroyed; there will be no future for the wicked. The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; He is their stronghold in times of trouble. The Lord helps them and delivers them; He delivers them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in Him.

Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath. Your arrows have pierced me, and Your hand has come down on me. Because of Your wrath, there is no health in my body; there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin. My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly. I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning. My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body. I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart. All my longings lie open before You, Lord; my sighing is not hidden from You. My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes. My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away. Those who want to kill me set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they scheme and lie. I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, like the mute, who cannot speak; I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply. Lord, I wait for You; You will answer, Lord my God. For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip." For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me. I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin. Many have become my enemies without cause; those who hate me without reason are numerous. Those who repay my good with evil lodge accusations against me, though I seek only to do what is good. Lord, do not forsake me; do not be far from me, my God. Come quickly to help me, my Lord and my Savior.

I said, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the presence of the wicked." So I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good. But my anguish increased; my heart grew hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue: "Show me, Lord, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is. You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before You. Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure. Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom; in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth without knowing whose it will finally be. But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in You. Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools. I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for You are the one who has done this. Remove Your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of Your hand. When You rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, You consume their wealth like a moth—surely everyone is but a breath. Hear my prayer, Lord, listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. I dwell with You as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were. Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again before I depart and am no more."

I waited patiently for the Lord; He turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; He set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in Him. Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods. Many, Lord my God, are the wonders You have done, the things You planned for us. None can compare with You; were I to speak and tell of Your deeds, they would be too many to declare. Sacrifice and offering You did not desire—but my ears You have opened—burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require. Then I said, "Here I am, I have come—it is written about me in the scroll. I desire to do Your will, my God; Your law is within my heart." I proclaim Your saving acts in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, Lord, as You know. I do not hide Your righteousness in my heart; I speak of Your faithfulness and Your saving help. I do not conceal Your love and Your faithfulness from the great assembly. Do not withhold Your mercy from me, Lord; may Your love and faithfulness always protect me. For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me. Be pleased to save me, Lord; come quickly, Lord, to help me. May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" be appalled at their own shame. But may all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who long for Your saving help always say, "The Lord is great!" But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; You are my God, do not delay.

Blessed is the one who considers the poor; the Lord will deliver them in times of trouble. The Lord will protect them and preserve their lives; He will bless them in the land and not surrender them to the desire of their foes. The Lord will sustain them on their sickbed and restore them from their bed of illness. I said, "Have mercy on me, Lord; heal me, for I have sinned against You." My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die and his name perish?" When one of them comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it around. All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying, "A vile disease has afflicted him; he will never get up from the place where he lies." Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me. But may You have mercy on me, Lord; raise me up, that I may repay them. I know that You are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me. Because of my integrity, You uphold me and set me in Your presence forever. Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.

As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for You, my God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God? My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me all day long, "Where is your God?" These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng. Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?"Why are you so downcast, my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God. My soul is downcast within me; therefore, I will remember You from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon—from Mount Mizar. Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and breakers have swept over me. By day the Lord directs His love, at night His song is with me—a prayer to the God of my life. I say to God my Rock, 'Why have You forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?' My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, 'Where is your God?' Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.

Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation. Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked. You are God my stronghold. Why have You rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy? Send me Your light and Your faithful care, let them lead me; let them bring me to Your holy mountain, to the place where You dwell. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise You with the lyre, O God, my God. Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.

We have heard it with our ears, O God; our ancestors have told us what You did in their days, in days long ago. With Your hand You drove out the nations and planted our ancestors; You crushed the peoples and made our ancestors flourish. It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, for You loved them. You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob. Through You we push back our enemies; through Your name we trample our foes. I put no trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory; but You give us victory over our enemies, You put our adversaries to shame. In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise Your name forever.

But now You have rejected and humbled us; You no longer go out with our armies. You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us. You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations. You sold Your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale. You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us. You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us. I live in disgrace all day long, and my face is covered with shame at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge. All this came upon us, though we had not forgotten You; we had not been false to Your covenant. Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from Your path. But You crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals; You covered us over with deep darkness. If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god, would not God have discovered it, since He knows the secrets of the heart? Yet for Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. Awake, Lord! Why do You sleep? Rouse Yourself! Do not reject us forever. Why do You hide Your face and forget our misery and oppression? We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground. Rise up and help us; rescue us because of Your unfailing love.

My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses for the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer. You are the most excellent of men and Your lips have been anointed with grace, since God has blessed You forever. Gird Your sword on Your side, You mighty one; clothe Yourself with splendor and majesty. In Your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility, and justice; let Your right hand achieve awesome deeds. Let Your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies; let the nations fall beneath Your feet. Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of Your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has set You above Your companions by anointing You with the oil of joy. All Your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces adorned with ivory the music of the strings makes You glad. Daughters of kings are among Your honored women; at Your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.

Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention: Forget your people and your father’s house. Let the king be enthralled by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord. The city of Tyre will come with a gift, people of wealth will seek your favor. All glorious is the princess within her chamber; her gown is interwoven with gold. In embroidered garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions follow her—those brought to be with her. Led in with joy and gladness, they enter the palace of the king. Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land. I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.

God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; He lifts His voice, the earth melts. The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Come and see what the Lord has done, the desolations He has brought on the earth. He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the shields with fire. He says, 'Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.' The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy. For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth. He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet. He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom He loved. God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets. Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises. For God is the King of all the earth; sing to Him a psalm of praise. God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne. The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham, for the kings of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.

Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, His holy mountain. Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, like the heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King. God is in her citadels; He has shown Himself to be her fortress. When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together, they saw her and were astounded; they fled in terror. Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor. You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind. As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the Lord Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever. Within Your temple, O God, we meditate on Your unfailing love. Like Your name, O God, Your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with righteousness. Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of Your judgments. Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers, consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation. For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even to the end.

Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world, both low and high, rich and poor alike: My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the meditation of my heart will give you understanding. I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle: Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me—those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches? No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them—the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough—so that they should live on forever and not see decay. For all can see that the wise die, that the foolish and the senseless also perish, leaving their wealth to others."People think their homes will last forever, naming lands after themselves. But humans, despite their honor, don't last; they perish like animals. This is their foolish way, yet their descendants approve of their sayings. Like sheep, they are destined for the grave, with death as their shepherd. The righteous will rule over them in the morning, and their beauty will decay in the grave, far from their homes. But God will redeem my soul from the grave's power and take me to Himself.

Don't be afraid when someone becomes rich and their house's glory increases. When they die, they take nothing with them; their glory doesn't follow them. Though they bless themselves in life and people praise them for their success, they will join their ancestors and never see the light again. People who have honor but lack understanding are like animals that perish.

The mighty God, the Lord, has spoken and called the earth from sunrise to sunset. From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. Our God comes and will not be silent; a consuming fire precedes Him, and a storm rages around Him. He summons the heavens above and the earth to judge His people: "Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice." The heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God Himself is judge.

"Listen, my people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel: I am God, your God. I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or burnt offerings, which are ever before me. I have no need of a bull from your stall or goats from your pens, for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills. I know every bird in the mountains, and the insects in the fields are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it. Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High, and call on me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me."

But to the wicked, God says: "What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips? You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you. When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers. You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit. You sit and testify against your brother and slander your own mother's son. When you did these things and I kept silent, you thought I was exactly like you. But I now rebuke you and set my accusations before you. Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you. Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me, and to the blameless, I will show my salvation."

Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion, blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight; so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge. Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; you taught me wisdom in that secret place. Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. Then I will teach transgressors your ways, so that sinners will turn back to you. Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, you who are God my Savior, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your praise. You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise. May it please you to prosper Zion, to build up the walls of Jerusalem. Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous, in burnt offerings offered whole; then bulls will be offered on your altar.

Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God? You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth. You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue! Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying, "Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!" But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God's unfailing love forever and ever. For what you have done, I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people. And I will hope in your name, for your name is good.

The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good. God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God. But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them. Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores His people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!

Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might. Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth. Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me—people without regard for God. Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me. Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness, destroy them. I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, Lord, for it is good. You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.

Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea; hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me, and I am distraught because of what my enemy is saying, because of the threats of the wicked; for they bring down suffering on me and assail me in their anger. My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen on me. Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me. I said, "Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. I would flee far away and stay in the desert; I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm." Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words, for I see violence and strife in the city. Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it. Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.

If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide. But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend, with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship at the house of God, as we walked about among the worshipers. Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the realm of the dead, for evil finds lodging among them. As for me, I call to God, and the Lord saves me. Evening, morning, and noon I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice. He rescues me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me. God, who is enthroned from of old, who does not change—He will hear them and humble them because they have no fear of God. My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant. His talk is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords. Cast your cares on the Lord, and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken. But you, God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of decay; the bloodthirsty and deceitful will not live out half their days. But as for me, I trust in you.

Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack."Be merciful to me, O God, for people are trying to crush me. They attack me all day long. My enemies pursue me constantly, and many are fighting against me, O Most High. When I am afraid, I will trust in you. In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me? All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil. They gather together, they hide, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life. Will they escape by their wrongdoing? In your anger, O God, bring down the nations. You keep track of my wanderings; put my tears in your bottle—are they not in your book? When I cry out to you, my enemies will turn back; this I know, for God is with me. In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise—in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? I am bound by my vows to you, O God; I will present my thank offerings to you. For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.

Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed. I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me. He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me; God sends forth his love and his faithfulness. I am in the midst of lions; I lie among ravenous beasts—men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth. They spread a net for my feet—I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path—but they have fallen into it themselves. My heart, O God, is steadfast, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music. Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples. For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.

Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge people with equity? No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth. Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies. Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears, that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be. Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; Lord, tear out the fangs of those lions! Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short. May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along, like a stillborn child that never sees the sun. Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns—whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away. The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked. Then people will say, "Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth."

Deliver me from my enemies, O God; be my fortress against those who are attacking me. Deliver me from evildoers and save me from those who are after my blood. See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, Lord. I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight! You, Lord God Almighty, you who are the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors. They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city. See what they spew from their mouths—the words from their lips are sharp as swords, and they think, "Who can hear us?" But you laugh at them, Lord; you scoff at all those nations. You are my strength, I watch for you; you, God, are my fortress, my God on whom I can rely. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me. But do not kill them, Lord our shield, or my people will forget. In your might, uproot them and bring them down. For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter, consume them in your wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city. They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied. But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble. You are my strength, I sing praise to you; you, God, are my fortress, my God on whom I can rely.

You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us; you have been angry—now restore us! You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking. You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger. But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow. Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered. God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter. Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph." Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us and no longer go out with our armies? Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless. With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.

Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer. From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe. I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings. For you, God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. Increase the days of the king's life, his years for many generations. May he be enthroned in God's presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him. Then I will ever sing in praise of your name and fulfill my vows day after day.

Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him. Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken. How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down—this leaning wall, this tottering fence? Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him. Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken. My salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge. Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge. Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie. If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath. Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them. One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: "Power belongs to you, God, and with you, Lord, is unfailing love"; and, "You reward everyone according to what they have done."

You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water. I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory. Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you. I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands. I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you. On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night. Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings. I cling to you; your right hand upholds me. Those who want to kill me will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth. They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals. But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.

Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy. Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers. They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows. They shoot from ambush at the innocent; they shoot suddenly, without fear. They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, "Who will see it?" They plot injustice and say, "We have devised a perfect plan!" Surely the human mind and heart are cunning. But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will suddenly be struck down. He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn. All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done. The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him."They say, "Who will see us?" They plot evil and think deeply about their schemes. But God will strike them down with an arrow, and they will be wounded suddenly. Their own words will turn against them, and everyone who sees them will flee. People will fear and declare God's works, considering His deeds wisely. The righteous will rejoice in the Lord, trust in Him, and all the upright in heart will glory.

Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion, and vows will be fulfilled to you. You who hear prayer, all people will come to you. Though we are overwhelmed by sins, you forgive our transgressions. Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts. We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple. You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas. You formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength. You stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy.

You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it. You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.

Shout for joy to God, all the earth! Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious. Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you. All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing the praises of your name." Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind! He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot—come, let us rejoice in him. He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations—let not the rebellious rise up against him.

Praise our God, all peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard; he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping. For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver. You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance. I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you—vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble. I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats.

Come and hear, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me. I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue. If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened; but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer. Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!

May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on us—so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations. May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. May the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you rule the peoples with equity and guide the nations of the earth. May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you. The land yields its harvest; God, our God, blesses us. May God bless us still, so that all the ends of the earth will fear him.

Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; let those who hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God; yes, let them exceedingly rejoice. Sing to God, sing praises to his name; extol him who rides on the clouds by his name, Yah, and rejoice before him. A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling. God sets the lonely in families, he leads out the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.

When you, God, went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance. Your people settled in it, and from your bounty, God, you provided for the poor. The Lord announced the word, and great was the company of those who proclaimed it: "Kings and armies flee in haste; the women at home divide the plunder. Even while you sleep among the sheep pens, the wings of my dove are sheathed with silver, its feathers with shining gold." When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land, it was like snow fallen on Mount Zalmon.

Mount Bashan, majestic mountain, Mount Bashan, rugged mountain, why gaze in envy, you rugged mountain, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the Lord himself will dwell forever? The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord has come from Sinai into his sanctuary. When you ascended on high, you took many captives; you received gifts from people, even from the rebellious—that you, Lord God, might dwell there.

Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens. Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign Lord comes escape from death. Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins. The Lord says, "I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea, that your feet may wade in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share."

Your procession, God, has come into view, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary. In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the young women playing the timbrels. Praise God in the great congregation; praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel. There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah's princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.

Summon your power, God; show us your strength, our God, as you have done before. Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts. Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may the beast bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war. Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush will submit herself to God.

Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord, to him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient heavens, who thunders with mighty voice. Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the heavens. You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!

Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me. I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God. Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal. You, God, know my folly; my guilt is not hidden from you."Don't let the floodwaters overwhelm me, or let the deep swallow me up, and don't let the pit close its mouth over me. Hear me, O LORD, for your lovingkindness is good; turn to me according to your abundant mercy. Don't hide your face from your servant, for I am in trouble; answer me quickly. Come near to my soul and redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies. You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; my adversaries are all before you. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink. Let their table become a snare before them, and what should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. Let their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and make their loins continually shake. Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their habitation be desolate, and let none dwell in their tents. For they persecute the one you have struck, and talk about the pain of those you have wounded. Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into your righteousness. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. But I am poor and sorrowful; let your salvation, O God, set me on high. I will praise the name of God with a song and magnify him with thanksgiving. This will please the LORD better than an ox or bull with horns and hooves. The humble will see this and be glad; your hearts will live that seek God. For the LORD hears the poor and does not despise his prisoners. Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moves in them. For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, so they may dwell there and possess it. The descendants of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there.

Hurry, O God, to deliver me; hurry to help me, O Lord. Let those who seek my life be ashamed and confused; let those who desire my harm be turned back and disgraced. Let them be turned back because of their shame, those who say, 'Aha, aha.' Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation continually say, 'Let God be magnified.' But I am poor and needy; hurry to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.

In you, O LORD, I put my trust; let me never be put to shame. Deliver me in your righteousness and cause me to escape; incline your ear to me and save me. Be my strong refuge, where I may continually go; you have given the commandment to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. For you are my hope, O Lord GOD; you are my trust from my youth. By you, I have been upheld from birth; you are the one who took me out of my mother's womb. My praise shall be continually of you. I have become a wonder to many, but you are my strong refuge. Let my mouth be filled with your praise and with your glory all the day. Do not cast me off in the time of old age; do not forsake me when my strength fails. For my enemies speak against me, and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together, saying, 'God has forsaken him; pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him.' O God, do not be far from me; O my God, hurry to help me. Let them be confounded and consumed who are adversaries to my life; let them be covered with reproach and dishonor who seek my harm. But I will hope continually and will praise you more and more. My mouth shall tell of your righteousness and your salvation all the day, for I do not know their limits. I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD; I will make mention of your righteousness, of yours only. O God, you have taught me from my youth, and to this day I declare your wondrous works. Now also, when I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not forsake me until I declare your strength to this generation, your power to everyone who is to come. Your righteousness, O God, is very high, you who have done great things; O God, who is like you? You, who have shown me great and severe troubles, shall revive me again and bring me up again from the depths of the earth. You shall increase my greatness and comfort me on every side. I will also praise you with the psaltery, even your truth, O my God; to you, I will sing with the harp, O Holy One of Israel. My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to you, and my soul, which you have redeemed. My tongue also shall talk of your righteousness all the day long, for they are confounded, for they are brought to shame who seek my harm.

Give the king your judgments, O God, and your righteousness to the king's son. He shall judge your people with righteousness and your poor with justice. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth. In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace until the moon is no more. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. Yes, all kings shall fall down before him; all nations shall serve him. For he shall deliver the needy when he cries, the poor also, and the one who has no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy. He shall redeem their life from oppression and violence, and precious shall be their blood in his sight. And he shall live, and to him shall be given the gold of Sheba; prayer also shall be made for him continually, and daily he shall be praised. There shall be an abundance of grain in the earth, on the top of the mountains; its fruit shall wave like Lebanon, and those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. His name shall endure forever; his name shall continue as long as the sun. Men shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him blessed. Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only does wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name forever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen. The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.

Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped. For I was envious of the boastful when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. For there are no pangs in their death, but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as other men, nor are they plagued like other men. Therefore pride serves as their necklace; violence covers them like a garment. Their eyes bulge with abundance; they have more than heart could wish. They scoff and speak wickedly concerning oppression; they speak loftily. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth. Therefore his people return here, and waters of a full cup are drained by them. And they say, 'How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?' Behold, these are the ungodly, who are always at ease; they increase in riches. Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocence. For all day long I have been plagued and chastened every morning. If I had said, 'I will speak thus,' behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of your children. When I thought how to understand this, it was too painful for me—until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I understood their end. Surely you set them in slippery places; you cast them down to destruction. How they are brought to desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream when one awakes, so, O Lord, when you awake, you shall despise their image. Thus my heart was grieved, and I was vexed in my mind. I was so foolish and ignorant; I was like a beast before you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold me by my right hand. You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. For indeed, those who are far from you shall perish; you have destroyed all those who desert you for harlotry. But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all your works.

O God, why have you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture? Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, which you have redeemed, this Mount Zion where you have dwelt.""Rise up, O God, and see the everlasting ruins; the enemy has done terrible things in your sanctuary. Your enemies roar in the midst of your congregations; they have set up their banners as signs. It used to be that a man was famous for cutting down thick trees, but now they destroy the carved work with axes and hammers. They have set fire to your sanctuary and defiled the dwelling place of your name, bringing it to the ground. They said in their hearts, 'Let us destroy them together,' and they have burned all the synagogues of God in the land. We no longer see our signs; there is no prophet left, and no one among us knows how long this will last. O God, how long will the enemy mock? Will the adversary blaspheme your name forever? Why do you hold back your hand, even your right hand? Take it from your bosom and destroy them. For God is my King from long ago, bringing salvation to the earth. You divided the sea by your strength; you broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. You crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the wilderness. You opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever-flowing rivers. The day is yours, and the night is also yours; you established the light and the sun. You set all the boundaries of the earth; you made summer and winter. Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, and how foolish people have blasphemed your name. Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever. Have regard for your covenant, because the dark places of the land are full of violence. Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name. Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long. Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.

We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near, and people tell of your wonderful deeds. When I choose the appointed time, I will judge with equity. When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah. I said to the arrogant, 'Boast no more,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horns. Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.' No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves. It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another. In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs. As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob, who says, 'I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.'

In Judah, God is known; his name is great in Israel. His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war. Selah. You are radiant with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game. The valiant lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands. At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still. It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry? From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet when you, God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah. Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained. Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared. He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.

I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me. When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted. I remembered you, God, and I groaned; I meditated, and my spirit grew faint. Selah. You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak. I thought about the former days, the years of long ago; I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated, and my spirit asked: 'Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again? Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time? Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?' Selah. Then I thought, 'To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago. I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds.' Your ways, God, are holy. What god is as great as our God? You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples. With your mighty arm, you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed. The clouds poured down water, the heavens resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth. Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked. Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen. You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Listen, my people, to my teaching; turn your ears to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old—things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us. We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done. He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children, so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands. They would not be like their ancestors—a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle; they did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by his law. They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them. He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand up like a wall. He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night. He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas; he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers. But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High. They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved. They spoke against God; they said, 'Can God really spread a table in the wilderness? True, he struck the rock and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread? Can he supply meat for his people?' When the LORD heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance. Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens; he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven. Human beings ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat. He let loose the east wind from the heavens and by his power made the south wind blow. He rained meat down on them like dust, birds like sand on the seashore. He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents. They ate till they were gorged—he had given them what they craved. But before they turned from what they craved, even while the food was still in their mouths, God’s anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel. In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe. So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror. Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again. They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer. But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues; their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant. Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath. He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the wasteland! Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel."The people forgot God's power and the day He saved them from their enemies. They didn't remember the miracles He performed in Egypt, like turning rivers into blood and sending plagues of flies and frogs. He destroyed their crops with hail and locusts, and their livestock with thunderbolts. God unleashed His anger, sending destruction and death, even killing the firstborn in Egypt. Yet, He led His own people like a shepherd, guiding them safely through the wilderness and overwhelming their enemies with the sea.

God brought them to His holy mountain and gave them the land of other nations. Despite this, they continued to disobey and provoke Him, worshiping idols and turning away from His teachings. God was angry and abandoned His sanctuary, allowing His people to be defeated and their priests killed. But then, like a warrior waking from sleep, He struck down His enemies and chose the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion as His dwelling place. He selected David to lead His people, guiding them with integrity and skill.

The people cried out to God, lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem and the desecration of the temple. They asked how long God would be angry and pleaded for His mercy and salvation. They wanted God to show His power and avenge the blood of His servants. They promised to praise Him forever if He would save them.

God, the Shepherd of Israel, was asked to shine forth and save His people. They felt abandoned and mocked by their enemies, and they pleaded for God to restore them. They remembered how God brought them out of Egypt and planted them like a vine, but now they felt vulnerable and attacked. They begged God to look down from heaven and protect them, promising to remain faithful if He would revive them.

The people were encouraged to sing joyfully to God and celebrate His festivals. God reminded them of His deliverance from Egypt and His provision in the wilderness. He warned them not to worship other gods and lamented their disobedience. If only they had listened, He would have defeated their enemies and provided abundantly for them.

God stands among the mighty and judges the earth. He calls for justice for the poor and needy and warns that those who judge unjustly will fall. The people asked God to rise and judge the earth, as all nations belong to Him.

They pleaded with God not to remain silent while their enemies plotted against them. They asked God to defeat their enemies as He had done in the past, to make them like chaff before the wind, and to fill them with shame so they would seek God."Let them be ashamed and troubled forever, O LORD. Let them be humiliated and perish so that people will know that You alone, whose name is JEHOVAH, are the Most High over all the earth.

How lovely are Your dwelling places, O LORD of hosts! My soul longs, even faints, for the courts of the LORD. My heart and flesh cry out for the living God. Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young—Your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will still be praising You. Selah.

Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, whose heart is set on pilgrimage. As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; listen, O God of Jacob. Selah. Look upon our shield, O God; look with favor on Your anointed one. Better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does He withhold from those whose walk is blameless. O LORD of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in You.

LORD, You have been favorable to Your land; You have restored the fortunes of Jacob. You forgave the iniquity of Your people and covered all their sins. Selah. You set aside all Your wrath and turned from Your fierce anger. Restore us again, God our Savior, and put away Your displeasure toward us. Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger through all generations? Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You? Show us Your unfailing love, LORD, and grant us Your salvation.

I will listen to what God the LORD says; He promises peace to His people, His faithful servants—but let them not return to folly. Surely His salvation is near those who fear Him, that His glory may dwell in our land. Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other. Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven. The LORD will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest. Righteousness goes before Him and prepares the way for His steps.

Hear me, LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy. Guard my life, for I am faithful to You; save Your servant who trusts in You. You are my God; have mercy on me, Lord, for I call to You all day long. Bring joy to Your servant, Lord, for I put my trust in You. You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to You. Hear my prayer, LORD; listen to my cry for mercy. When I am in distress, I call to You because You answer me. Among the gods, there is none like You, Lord; no deeds can compare with Yours. All the nations You have made will come and worship before You, Lord; they will bring glory to Your name. For You are great and do marvelous deeds; You alone are God. Teach me Your way, LORD, that I may rely on Your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your name. I will praise You, Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify Your name forever. For great is Your love toward me; You have delivered me from the depths, from the realm of the dead. Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God; ruthless people are trying to kill me—they have no regard for You. But You, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness. Turn to me and have mercy on me; show Your strength in behalf of Your servant; save me because I serve You just as my mother did. Give me a sign of Your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for You, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.

The LORD's foundation is in the holy mountains. He loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are said of you, city of God. Selah. I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me—Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush—and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’ Indeed, of Zion it will be said, ‘This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High Himself will establish her.’ The LORD will write in the register of the peoples: ‘This one was born in Zion.’ Selah. As they make music, they will sing, ‘All my fountains are in you.’

LORD, the God of my salvation, I cry out to You day and night. May my prayer come before You; turn Your ear to my cry. I am overwhelmed with troubles, and my life draws near to death. I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like one without strength. I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more, who are cut off from Your care. You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths. Your wrath lies heavily on me; You have overwhelmed me with all Your waves. Selah. You have taken from me my closest friends and have made me repulsive to them. I am confined and cannot escape; my eyes are dim with grief. I call to You, LORD, every day; I spread out my hands to You. Do You show Your wonders to the dead? Do their spirits rise up and praise You? Selah. Is Your love declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in Destruction? Are Your wonders known in the place of darkness, or Your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion? But I cry to You for help, LORD; in the morning my prayer comes before You. Why, LORD, do You reject me and hide Your face from me? From my youth, I have suffered and been close to death; I have borne Your terrors and am in despair. Your wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me. All day long, they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me. You have taken from me friend and neighbor—darkness is my closest friend.

I will sing of the LORD's great love forever; with my mouth, I will make Your faithfulness known through all generations. I will declare that Your love stands firm forever, that You have established Your faithfulness in heaven itself. You said, ‘I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant, I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.’ Selah. The heavens praise Your wonders, LORD, Your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones. For who in the skies above can compare with the LORD? Who is like the LORD among the heavenly beings? In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared; He is more awesome than all who surround Him. Who is like You, LORD God Almighty? You, LORD, are mighty, and Your faithfulness surrounds You. You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them. You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with Your strong arm, You scattered Your enemies. The heavens are Yours, and Yours also the earth; You founded the world and all that is in it. You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at Your name. Your arm is endowed with power; Your hand is strong, Your right hand exalted. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; love and faithfulness go before You. Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim You, who walk in the light of Your presence, LORD. They rejoice in Your name all day long; they celebrate Your righteousness. For You are their glory and strength, and by Your favor, You exalt our horn. Indeed, our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.

Once You spoke in a vision, to Your faithful people You said: ‘I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have raised up a young man from among the people. I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil, I have anointed him. My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him. The enemy will not get the better of him; the wicked will not oppress him. I will crush his foes before him and strike down his adversaries. My faithful love will be with him, and through My name, his horn will be exalted. I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers. He will call out to Me, “You are my Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.” And I will appoint him to be My firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth. I will maintain My love to him forever, and My covenant with him will never fail. I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure. If his sons forsake My law and do not follow My statutes, if they violate My decrees and fail to keep My commands, I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging. But I will not take My love from him, nor will I ever betray My faithfulness. I will not violate My covenant or alter what My lips have uttered. Once for all, I have sworn by My holiness—and I will not lie to David—that his line will continue forever and his throne endure before Me like the sun; it will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.’ Selah.""Selah. But now, you have rejected and spurned us, and you are angry with your anointed one. You have renounced the covenant with your servant and defiled his crown in the dust. You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins. All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors. You have exalted the right hand of his foes and made all his enemies rejoice. You have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle. You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground. You have cut short the days of his youth and covered him with a mantle of shame. Selah.

How long, LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire? Remember how fleeting my life is. For what futility you have created all humanity! Who can live and not see death, or who can escape the power of the grave? Selah. Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David? Remember, Lord, how your servant has been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations, the taunts with which your enemies, LORD, have mocked, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one. Praise be to the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.

Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations. Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. You turn people back to dust, saying, 'Return to dust, you mortals.' A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night. Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death—they are like the new grass of the morning: In the morning it springs up new, but by evening it is dry and withered. We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation. You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan. Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away. If only we knew the power of your anger! Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due. Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. Relent, LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants. Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble. May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children. May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us; establish the work of our hands for us—yes, establish the work of our hands.

Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, 'He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked. If you say, 'The LORD is my refuge,' and you make the Most High your dwelling, no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent. For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent. 'Because he loves me,' says the LORD, 'I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.'

It is good to praise the LORD and make music to your name, O Most High, proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night, to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp. For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD; I sing for joy at what your hands have done. How great are your works, LORD, how profound your thoughts! Senseless people do not know, fools do not understand, that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever. But you, LORD, are forever exalted. For surely your enemies, LORD, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered. You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured on me. My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes. The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God. They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green, proclaiming, 'The LORD is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.'

The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength; indeed, the world is established, firm and secure. Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity. The seas have lifted up, LORD, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves. Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea—the LORD on high is mighty. Your statutes, LORD, stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days.

The LORD is a God who avenges. O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve. How long, LORD, will the wicked, how long will the wicked be jubilant? They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting. They crush your people, LORD; they oppress your inheritance. They slay the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless. They say, 'The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob takes no notice.' Take notice, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise? Does he who fashioned the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see? Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches mankind lack knowledge? The LORD knows all human plans; he knows that they are futile. Blessed is the one you discipline, LORD, the one you teach from your law; you grant them relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked. For the LORD will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance. Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers? Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death. When I said, 'My foot is slipping,' your unfailing love, LORD, supported me. When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy. Can a corrupt throne be allied with you—a throne that brings on misery by its decrees? The wicked band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. But the LORD has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge. He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the LORD our God will destroy them.

Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song. For the LORD is the great God, the great King above all gods. In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him. The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. Today, if only you would hear his voice, 'Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the wilderness, where your ancestors tested me; they tried me, though they had seen what I did. For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways." So I declared on oath in my anger, "They shall never enter my rest."'

Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth. Sing to the LORD, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day."Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous deeds among all people. The LORD is great and deserves high praise; He is to be revered above all gods. All the gods of the nations are mere idols, but the LORD made the heavens. Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. Give to the LORD, families of nations, give to the LORD glory and strength. Give to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and come into His courts. Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth. Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns." The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity. Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and all that is in it. Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; let all the trees of the forest sing for joy. Let all creation rejoice before the LORD, for He comes, He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in His faithfulness.

The LORD reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice. Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. Fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side. His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles. The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth. The heavens proclaim His righteousness, and all peoples see His glory. All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idols—worship Him, all you gods! Zion hears and rejoices, and the villages of Judah are glad because of Your judgments, LORD. For You, LORD, are the Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods. Let those who love the LORD hate evil, for He guards the lives of His faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked. Light shines on the righteous and joy on the upright in heart. Rejoice in the LORD, you who are righteous, and praise His holy name.

Sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have worked salvation for Him. The LORD has made His salvation known and revealed His righteousness to the nations. He has remembered His love and His faithfulness to Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music; make music to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing, with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn—shout for joy before the LORD, the King. Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it. Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy; let them sing before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.

The LORD reigns, let the nations tremble; He sits enthroned between the cherubim, let the earth shake. Great is the LORD in Zion; He is exalted over all the nations. Let them praise Your great and awesome name—He is holy. The King is mighty, He loves justice—You have established equity; in Jacob You have done what is just and right. Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His footstool; He is holy. Moses and Aaron were among His priests, Samuel was among those who called on His name; they called on the LORD and He answered them. He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept His statutes and the decrees He gave them. LORD our God, You answered them; You were to Israel a forgiving God, though You punished their misdeeds. Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.

Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. Worship the LORD with gladness; come before Him with joyful songs. Know that the LORD is God. It is He who made us, and we are His; we are His people, the sheep of His pasture. Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and praise His name. For the LORD is good and His love endures forever; His faithfulness continues through all generations.

I will sing of Your love and justice; to You, LORD, I will sing praise. I will be careful to lead a blameless life—when will You come to me? I will conduct the affairs of my house with a blameless heart. I will not look with approval on anything that is vile. I hate what faithless people do; I will have no part in it. The perverse of heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with what is evil. Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not tolerate. My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; the one whose walk is blameless will minister to me. No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence. Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.

Hear my prayer, LORD; let my cry for help come to You. Do not hide Your face from me when I am in distress. Turn Your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly. For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers. My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food. In my distress I groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones. I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins. I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof. All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse. For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears because of Your great wrath, for You have taken me up and thrown me aside. My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass. But You, LORD, sit enthroned forever; Your renown endures through all generations. You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come. For her stones are dear to Your servants; her very dust moves them to pity. The nations will fear the name of the LORD, all the kings of the earth will revere Your glory. For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in His glory. He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; He will not despise their plea. Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD: "The LORD looked down from His sanctuary on high, from heaven He viewed the earth, to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death." So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD. In the course of my life He broke my strength; He cut short my days. So I said: "Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; Your years go on through all generations. In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing You will change them and they will be discarded. But You remain the same, and Your years will never end. The children of Your servants will live in Your presence; their descendants will be established before You."

Bless the LORD, my soul; all my inmost being, praise His holy name. Bless the LORD, my soul, and forget not all His benefits—who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. The LORD works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. He made known His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel: The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. He will not always accuse, nor will He harbor His anger forever; He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His love for those who fear Him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him; for He knows how we are formed, He remembers that we are dust. The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field; the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more. But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD’s love is with those who fear Him, and His righteousness with their children’s children—with those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His precepts. The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all. Praise the LORD, you His angels, you mighty ones who do His bidding, who obey His word. Praise the LORD, all His heavenly hosts, you His servants who do His will. Praise the LORD, all His works everywhere in His dominion. Praise the LORD, my soul.Praise the LORD, my soul. LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with honor and majesty. You cover Yourself with light like a garment and stretch out the heavens like a curtain. You lay the beams of Your chambers in the waters, make the clouds Your chariot, and walk on the wings of the wind. You make Your angels spirits and Your ministers a flaming fire. You laid the foundations of the earth so it should not be moved forever. You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. At Your rebuke, they fled; at the sound of Your thunder, they hurried away. They went up over the mountains and down into the valleys, to the place You appointed for them. You set a boundary they cannot cross, so they will never again cover the earth.

You send springs into the valleys; they flow among the hills. They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the branches. You water the mountains from Your chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of Your work. You make grass grow for the cattle and plants for people to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth: wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts. The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted. There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the junipers. The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the hyrax.

You made the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down. You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the beasts of the forest prowl. The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God. The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens. Then people go out to their work, to their labor until evening.

How many are Your works, LORD! In wisdom You made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures. There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number—living things both large and small. There the ships go to and fro, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there. All creatures look to You to give them their food at the proper time. When You give it to them, they gather it up; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things. When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to the dust. When You send Your Spirit, they are created, and You renew the face of the ground.

May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works—He who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live. May my meditation be pleasing to Him, as I rejoice in the LORD. But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the LORD, my soul. Praise the LORD.

Give thanks to the LORD; call on His name; make known among the nations what He has done. Sing to Him, sing praise to Him; tell of all His wonderful acts. Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. Look to the LORD and His strength; seek His face always. Remember the wonders He has done, His miracles, and the judgments He pronounced, you His servants, the descendants of Abraham, His chosen ones, the children of Jacob. He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth. He remembers His covenant forever, the promise He made, for a thousand generations, the covenant He made with Abraham, the oath He swore to Isaac. He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant: "To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."

When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it, they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another. He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake, He rebuked kings: "Do not touch My anointed ones; do My prophets no harm." He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food; and He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave. They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons, till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true. The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free. He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed, to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.

Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham. The LORD made His people very fruitful; He made them too numerous for their foes, whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants. He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen. They performed His signs among them, His wonders in the land of Ham. He sent darkness and made the land dark—for had they not rebelled against His words? He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die. Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers. He spoke, and there came swarms of flies and gnats throughout their country. He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land; He struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country. He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number; they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil. Then He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood. He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered. Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.

He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night. They asked, and He brought them quail; He fed them well with the bread of heaven. He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert. For He remembered His holy promise given to His servant Abraham. He brought out His people with rejoicing, His chosen ones with shouts of joy; He gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for—that they might keep His precepts and observe His laws. Praise the LORD.

Praise the LORD. Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His love endures forever. Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare His praise? Blessed are those who act justly, who always do what is right. Remember me, LORD, when You show favor to Your people, come to my aid when You save them, that I may enjoy the prosperity of Your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of Your nation and join Your inheritance in giving praise.

We have sinned, even as our ancestors did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly. When our ancestors were in Egypt, they gave no thought to Your miracles; they did not remember Your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. Yet He saved them for His name’s sake, to make His mighty power known. He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert. He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy, He redeemed them. The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived. Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.

But they soon forgot what He had done and did not wait for His plan to unfold. In the desert, they gave in to their craving; in the wilderness, they put God to the test. So He gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them. In the camp, they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD. The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram. Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked. At Horeb, they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal. They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass. They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. So He said He would destroy them—had not Moses, His chosen one, stood in the breach before Him to keep His wrath from destroying them.They provoked His spirit, causing Him to speak rashly. They didn't destroy the nations as the LORD commanded but mingled with them and adopted their practices. They worshiped idols, which ensnared them. They even sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons, shedding innocent blood and polluting the land. They defiled themselves with their actions and inventions, leading the LORD to become angry with them. He handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed and ruled over them. Despite delivering them many times, they continued to rebel and were brought low by their sins. Yet, when they cried out in their distress, He heard them and remembered His covenant, showing them mercy. He made their captors pity them.

"Save us, LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, so we can give thanks to Your holy name and triumph in Your praise. Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, 'Amen.' Praise the LORD."

Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His love endures forever. Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, those He redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered from the lands, from east and west, north and south. They wandered in the wilderness, finding no city to dwell in, hungry and thirsty, their souls fainting. Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress. He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle. Let them give thanks to the LORD for His unfailing love and His wonderful deeds for mankind, for He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.

Some sat in darkness and the shadow of death, bound in affliction and iron because they rebelled against God's words and despised the counsel of the Most High. He subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke their chains. Let them give thanks to the LORD for His unfailing love and His wonderful deeds for mankind, for He breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.

Fools, because of their rebellious ways and sins, suffered affliction. They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress. He sent out His word and healed them; He rescued them from the grave. Let them give thanks to the LORD for His unfailing love and His wonderful deeds for mankind. Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of His works with songs of joy.

Those who go out to sea in ships, doing business on the mighty waters, see the works of the LORD and His wonders in the deep. He spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted the waves. They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril, their courage melted away. They reeled and staggered like drunkards, at their wits' end. Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress. He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed. They were glad when it grew calm, and He guided them to their desired haven. Let them give thanks to the LORD for His unfailing love and His wonderful deeds for mankind. Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders.

He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground, and fruitful land into a salt waste because of the wickedness of those who lived there. He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs; there He brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle. They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest; He blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and He did not let their herds diminish. Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity, and sorrow. He who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste. But He lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks. The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths. Let the one who is wise heed these things and ponder the loving deeds of the LORD.

My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing and make music with all my soul. Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. I will praise You, LORD, among the nations; I will sing of You among the peoples. For great is Your love, higher than the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let Your glory be over all the earth. Save us and help us with Your right hand, that those You love may be delivered. God has spoken from His sanctuary: "In triumph, I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth. Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter. Moab is My washbasin, on Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia, I shout in triumph."

Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? Is it not You, God, who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies? Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless. With God, we will gain the victory, and He will trample down our enemies.

O God, whom I praise, do not remain silent, for people who are wicked and deceitful have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues. With words of hatred, they surround me; they attack me without cause. In return for my friendship, they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer. They repay me evil for good and hatred for my friendship. Appoint someone evil to oppose my enemy; let an accuser stand at his right hand. When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him. May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership. May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes. May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor. May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children. May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation. May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out. May their sins always remain before the LORD, that He may blot out their name from the earth. For he never thought of doing a kindness but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted. He loved to pronounce a curse—may it come back on him. He found no pleasure in blessing—may it be far from him. He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil. May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him. May this be the LORD's payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me.

But You, Sovereign LORD, help me for Your name's sake; out of the goodness of Your love, deliver me. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust. My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt. I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads. Help me, LORD my God; save me according to Your unfailing love. Let them know that it is Your hand, that You, LORD, have done it. While they curse, may You bless; may those who attack me be put to shame, but may Your servant rejoice. May my accusers be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak. With my mouth, I will greatly extol the LORD; in the great throng of worshipers, I will praise Him. For He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save their lives from those who would condemn them.

The LORD says to my lord: "Sit at My right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." The LORD will extend Your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, "Rule in the midst of Your enemies!" Your troops will be willing on Your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, Your young men will come to You like dew from the morning's womb. The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek." The Lord is at Your right hand; He will crush kings on the day of His wrath. He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth. He will drink from a brook along the way, and so He will lift His head high."Your power is displayed in the beauty of holiness from the dawn of the morning; you possess the vigor of youth. The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: 'You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.' The Lord at your right hand will crush kings on the day of His wrath. He will judge the nations, filling the lands with corpses and crushing the leaders of many countries. He will drink from a brook along the way, and so He will lift His head high.

Praise the LORD! I will praise the LORD with all my heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation. The works of the LORD are great, sought out by all who take pleasure in them. His work is honorable and glorious, and His righteousness endures forever. He has made His wonderful works to be remembered; the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. He provides food for those who fear Him; He always remembers His covenant. He has shown His people the power of His works, giving them the inheritance of the nations. The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever, done in truth and uprightness. He sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow His commandments have good understanding. His praise endures forever.

Praise the LORD! Blessed is the one who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments. Their descendants will be mighty on earth; the generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches are in their house, and their righteousness endures forever. Light dawns in the darkness for the upright; they are gracious, compassionate, and righteous. A good person shows favor and lends; they will guide their affairs with discretion. Surely they will never be shaken; the righteous will be remembered forever. They will not fear bad news; their heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD. Their heart is secure, they will have no fear; in the end, they will look in triumph on their foes. They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor. The wicked will see and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will come to nothing.

Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised. The LORD is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens. Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high, who looks far down on the heavens and the earth? He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes, with the princes of His people. He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children. Praise the LORD!

When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, Judah became His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion. The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back. The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs? Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.

Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name give glory, for the sake of Your steadfast love and Your faithfulness. Why should the nations say, 'Where is their God?' Our God is in the heavens; He does all that He pleases. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see. They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell. They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them. O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. The LORD has remembered us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron; He will bless those who fear the LORD, both small and great. May the LORD give you increase, you and your children! May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth. The heavens are the LORD's heavens, but the earth He has given to the children of man. The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence. But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!

I love the LORD, because He has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. Because He inclined His ear to me, therefore I will call on Him as long as I live. The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish. Then I called on the name of the LORD: 'O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!' Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; our God is merciful. The LORD preserves the simple; when I was brought low, He saved me. Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you. For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. I believed, even when I spoke: 'I am greatly afflicted'; I said in my alarm, 'All mankind are liars.' What shall I render to the LORD for all His benefits to me? I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD. I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people. Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints. O LORD, I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD. I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the house of the LORD, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!

Praise the LORD, all nations! Extol Him, all peoples! For great is His steadfast love toward us, and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever. Praise the LORD!

Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His steadfast love endures forever. Let Israel say, 'His steadfast love endures forever.' Let the house of Aaron say, 'His steadfast love endures forever.' Let those who fear the LORD say, 'His steadfast love endures forever.' Out of my distress, I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free. The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? The LORD is on my side as my helper; I shall look in triumph on those who hate me. It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man. It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes. All nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD, I cut them off! They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side; in the name of the LORD, I cut them off! They surrounded me like bees; they went out like a fire among thorns; in the name of the LORD, I cut them off! I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the LORD helped me. The LORD is my strength and my song; He has become my salvation. Glad songs of salvation are in the tents of the righteous: 'The right hand of the LORD does valiantly, the right hand of the LORD is exalted, the right hand of the LORD does valiantly!' I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the LORD. The LORD has disciplined me severely, but He has not given me over to death. Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD. This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it. I thank You that You have answered me and have become my salvation. The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the LORD's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. Save us, we pray, O LORD! O LORD, we pray, give us success! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD! We bless you from the house of the LORD. The LORD is God, and He has made His light to shine upon us. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords, up to the horns of the altar! You are my God, and I will give thanks to You; You are my God; I will extol You. Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His steadfast love endures forever!

Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the LORD. Blessed are those who keep His testimonies, who seek Him with their whole heart, who also do no wrong but walk in His ways. You have commanded Your precepts to be kept diligently.""Help me follow your commands diligently. I wish my actions were always guided by your rules! Then I wouldn't feel ashamed when I respect all your commandments. I will praise you with a sincere heart once I learn your righteous judgments. I will keep your statutes; please don't abandon me completely. How can a young person stay pure? By living according to your word. I seek you with all my heart; don't let me stray from your commands. I have hidden your word in my heart so I might not sin against you. Praise be to you, LORD; teach me your decrees. With my lips, I recount all the laws that come from your mouth. I rejoice in following your statutes as one rejoices in great riches. I meditate on your precepts and consider your ways. I delight in your decrees; I will not neglect your word. Be good to your servant while I live, that I may obey your word. Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law. I am a stranger on earth; do not hide your commands from me. My soul is consumed with longing for your laws at all times. You rebuke the arrogant, who are accursed, those who stray from your commands. Remove from me their scorn and contempt, for I keep your statutes. Though rulers sit together and slander me, your servant will meditate on your decrees. Your statutes are my delight; they are my counselors. I am laid low in the dust; preserve my life according to your word. I gave an account of my ways and you answered me; teach me your decrees. Cause me to understand the way of your precepts, that I may meditate on your wonderful deeds. My soul is weary with sorrow; strengthen me according to your word. Keep me from deceitful ways; be gracious to me and teach me your law. I have chosen the way of faithfulness; I have set my heart on your laws. I hold fast to your statutes, LORD; do not let me be put to shame. I run in the path of your commands, for you have broadened my understanding. Teach me, LORD, the way of your decrees, that I may follow it to the end. Give me understanding, so that I may keep your law and obey it with all my heart. Direct me in the path of your commands, for there I find delight. Turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain. Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word. Fulfill your promise to your servant, so that you may be feared. Take away the disgrace I dread, for your laws are good. How I long for your precepts! In your righteousness preserve my life. May your unfailing love come to me, LORD, your salvation, according to your promise; then I can answer anyone who taunts me, for I trust in your word. Never take your word of truth from my mouth, for I have put my hope in your laws. I will always obey your law, forever and ever. I will walk about in freedom, for I have sought out your precepts. I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame, for I delight in your commands because I love them. I reach out for your commands, which I love, that I may meditate on your decrees. Remember your word to your servant, for you have given me hope. My comfort in my suffering is this: Your promise preserves my life. The arrogant mock me unmercifully, but I do not turn from your law. I remember, LORD, your ancient laws, and I find comfort in them. Indignation grips me because of the wicked, who have forsaken your law. Your decrees are the theme of my song wherever I lodge. In the night, LORD, I remember your name, that I may keep your law. This has been my practice: I obey your precepts. You are my portion, LORD; I have promised to obey your words. I have sought your face with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your promise. I have considered my ways and have turned my steps to your statutes. I will hasten and not delay to obey your commands. Though the wicked bind me with ropes, I will not forget your law. At midnight I rise to give you thanks for your righteous laws. I am a friend to all who fear you, to all who follow your precepts. The earth is filled with your love, LORD; teach me your decrees. Do good to your servant according to your word, LORD. Teach me knowledge and good judgment, for I trust your commands. Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word. You are good, and what you do is good; teach me your decrees. Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies, I keep your precepts with all my heart. Their hearts are callous and unfeeling, but I delight in your law. It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your decrees. The law from your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces of silver and gold. Your hands made me and formed me; give me understanding to learn your commands. May those who fear you rejoice when they see me, for I have put my hope in your word. I know, LORD, that your laws are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me. May your unfailing love be my comfort, according to your promise to your servant. Let your compassion come to me that I may live, for your law is my delight. May the arrogant be put to shame for wronging me without cause; but I will meditate on your precepts. May those who fear you turn to me, those who understand your statutes. May I wholeheartedly follow your decrees, that I may not be put to shame. My soul faints with longing for your salvation, but I have put my hope in your word. My eyes fail, looking for your promise; I say, 'When will you comfort me?' Though I am like a wineskin in the smoke, I do not forget your decrees. How long must your servant wait? When will you punish my persecutors? The arrogant dig pits to trap me, contrary to your law. All your commands are trustworthy; help me, for I am being persecuted without cause. They almost wiped me from the earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts. In your unfailing love preserve my life, that I may obey the statutes of your mouth. Your word, LORD, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens. Your faithfulness continues through all generations; you established the earth, and it endures. Your laws endure to this day, for all things serve you. If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction. I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have preserved my life. Save me, for I am yours; I have sought out your precepts. The wicked are waiting to destroy me, but I will ponder your statutes. To all perfection I see a limit, but your commands are boundless. Oh, how I love your law! I meditate on it all day long. Your commands are always with me and make me wiser than my enemies. I have more insight than all my teachers, for I meditate on your statutes. I have more understanding than the elders, for I obey your precepts. I have kept my feet from every evil path so that I might obey your word. I have not departed from your laws, for you yourself have taught me. How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth! I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every wrong path. Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path. I have taken an oath and confirmed it, that I will follow your righteous laws. I have suffered much; preserve my life, LORD, according to your word. Accept, LORD, the willing praise of my mouth, and teach me your laws. Though I constantly take my life in my hands, I will not forget your law. The wicked have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your precepts. Your statutes are my heritage forever; they are the joy of my heart. My heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end. I hate double-minded people, but I love your law. You are my refuge and my shield; I have put my hope in your word. Away from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commands of my God! Sustain me, my God, according to your promise, and I will live; do not let my hopes be dashed. Uphold me, and I will be delivered; I will always have regard for your decrees. You reject all who stray from your decrees, for their delusions come to nothing. All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross; therefore I love your statutes. My flesh trembles in fear of you; I stand in awe of your laws. I have done what is righteous and just; do not leave me to my oppressors. Ensure your servant’s well-being; do not let the arrogant oppress me. My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, looking for your righteous promise. Deal with your servant according to your love and teach me your decrees. I am your servant; give me discernment that I may understand your statutes. It is time for you to act, LORD; your law is being broken. Because I love your commands more than gold, more than pure gold, and because I consider all your precepts right, I hate every wrong path."I value your commandments more than gold, even the finest gold. I consider all your precepts to be right and I despise every false way. Your testimonies are wonderful, which is why I follow them with all my heart. Your words bring light and understanding to the simple. I open my mouth and pant, longing for your commandments. Turn to me and be gracious, as you always are to those who love your name. Guide my steps by your word and don't let sin control me. Rescue me from human oppression so I can follow your precepts. Shine your face upon your servant and teach me your statutes. Streams of tears flow from my eyes because people do not follow your law. You are righteous, LORD, and your judgments are upright. Your testimonies are righteous and faithful. My zeal wears me out because my enemies ignore your words. Your word is pure, and I love it. Though I am lowly and despised, I do not forget your precepts. Your righteousness is everlasting, and your law is true. Though I face trouble and distress, your commandments are my delight. Your testimonies are forever righteous; give me understanding so I may live. I call out with all my heart; answer me, LORD, and I will obey your statutes. I cry out to you; save me, and I will keep your testimonies. I rise before dawn and cry for help; I have put my hope in your word. My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promises. Hear my voice in accordance with your love; preserve my life, LORD, according to your laws. Those who devise wicked schemes are near, but they are far from your law. Yet you are near, LORD, and all your commands are true. Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever. Look on my suffering and deliver me, for I have not forgotten your law. Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your promise. Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek out your decrees. Your compassion is great, LORD; preserve my life according to your laws. Many are the foes who persecute me, but I have not turned from your statutes. I look on the faithless with loathing, for they do not obey your word. See how I love your precepts; preserve my life, LORD, in accordance with your love. All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal. Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word. I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great treasure. I hate and detest falsehood but I love your law. Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws. Great peace have those who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble. I wait for your salvation, LORD, and I follow your commands. I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly. I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you. May my cry come before you, LORD; give me understanding according to your word. May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise. May my lips overflow with praise, for you teach me your decrees. May my tongue sing of your word, for all your commands are righteous. May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts. I long for your salvation, LORD, and your law gives me delight. Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me. I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant, for I have not forgotten your commands. In my distress, I cried to the LORD, and he answered me. Save me, LORD, from lying lips and deceitful tongues. What will he do to you, and what more besides, you deceitful tongue? He will punish you with a warrior's sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom bush. Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar! Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war. I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help come from? My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip—he who watches over you will not slumber; indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The LORD watches over you—the LORD is your shade at your right hand; the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. The LORD will keep you from all harm—he will watch over your life; the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore. I rejoiced with those who said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD." Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem. Jerusalem is built like a city that is closely compacted together. That is where the tribes go up—the tribes of the LORD—to praise the name of the LORD according to the statute given to Israel. There stand the thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May those who love you be secure. May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels." For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, "Peace be within you." For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity. I lift up my eyes to you, to you who sit enthroned in heaven. As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he shows us his mercy. Have mercy on us, LORD, have mercy on us, for we have endured no end of contempt. We have endured no end of ridicule from the arrogant, of contempt from the proud. If the LORD had not been on our side—let Israel say—if the LORD had not been on our side when people attacked us, they would have swallowed us alive when their anger flared against us; the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, the raging waters would have swept us away. Praise be to the LORD, who has not let us be torn by their teeth. We have escaped like a bird from the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped. Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever. As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people both now and forevermore. The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the righteous might use their hands to do evil. LORD, do good to those who are good, to those who are upright in heart. But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be on Israel. When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed. Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. Restore our fortunes, LORD, like streams in the Negev. Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy. Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them. Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain. In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat—for he grants sleep to those he loves. Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one's youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court. Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in obedience to him. You will eat the fruit of your labor; blessings and prosperity will be yours. Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. Yes, this will be the blessing for the man who fears the LORD. May the LORD bless you from Zion; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. May you live to see your children's children—peace be on Israel. They have greatly oppressed me from my youth, let Israel say; they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me. Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long. But the LORD is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked. May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame. May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow; a reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms. May those who pass by not say to them, "The blessing of the LORD be on you; we bless you in the name of the LORD." Out of the depths I cry to you, LORD; Lord, hear my voice."Listen to my voice, LORD; be attentive to my pleas for mercy. If you kept a record of sins, who could stand? But with you, there is forgiveness, so you are revered. I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and I hope in his word. My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning. Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is unfailing love and full redemption. He will redeem Israel from all their sins.

LORD, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty. I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like a weaned child. Israel, put your hope in the LORD now and forevermore.

LORD, remember David and all his hardships. He swore an oath to the LORD, a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob: 'I will not enter my house or go to my bed, I will allow no sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, till I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.' We heard it in Ephrathah, we came upon it in the fields of Jaar: 'Let us go to his dwelling place, let us worship at his footstool, saying, "Arise, LORD, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. May your priests be clothed with your righteousness; may your faithful people sing for joy." For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed one.'

The LORD swore an oath to David, a sure oath he will not revoke: 'One of your own descendants I will place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne forever and ever.' For the LORD has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling, saying, 'This is my resting place forever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it. I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor I will satisfy with food. I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful people will ever sing for joy. Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one. I will clothe his enemies with shame, but his head will be adorned with a radiant crown.'

How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity! It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron's beard, down on the collar of his robe. It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the LORD bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.

Praise the LORD, all you servants of the LORD who minister by night in the house of the LORD. Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and praise the LORD. May the LORD bless you from Zion, he who is the Maker of heaven and earth.

Praise the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD; praise him, you servants of the LORD, you who minister in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant. For the LORD has chosen Jacob to be his own, Israel to be his treasured possession. I know that the LORD is great, that our Lord is greater than all gods. The LORD does whatever pleases him, in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths. He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.

He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, the firstborn of people and animals. He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants. He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings—Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan—and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel. Your name, LORD, endures forever, your renown, LORD, through all generations. For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.

The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by human hands. They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see. They have ears, but cannot hear, nor is there breath in their mouths. Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them. All you Israelites, praise the LORD; house of Aaron, praise the LORD; house of Levi, praise the LORD; you who fear him, praise the LORD. Praise be to the LORD from Zion, to him who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.

Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good. His love endures forever. Give thanks to the God of gods. His love endures forever. Give thanks to the Lord of lords. His love endures forever. To him who alone does great wonders, his love endures forever. Who by his understanding made the heavens, his love endures forever. Who spread out the earth upon the waters, his love endures forever. Who made the great lights—his love endures forever. The sun to govern the day, his love endures forever. The moon and stars to govern the night, his love endures forever.

To him who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, his love endures forever. And brought Israel out from among them, his love endures forever. With a mighty hand and outstretched arm, his love endures forever. To him who divided the Red Sea asunder, his love endures forever. And brought Israel through the midst of it, his love endures forever. But swept Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea, his love endures forever. To him who led his people through the wilderness, his love endures forever. To him who struck down great kings, his love endures forever. And killed mighty kings—his love endures forever. Sihon king of the Amorites, his love endures forever. And Og king of Bashan, his love endures forever. And gave their land as an inheritance, his love endures forever. An inheritance to his servant Israel, his love endures forever.

He remembered us in our low estate, his love endures forever. And freed us from our enemies, his love endures forever. He gives food to every creature, his love endures forever. Give thanks to the God of heaven. His love endures forever.

By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept when we remembered Zion. There on the poplars we hung our harps, for there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy; they said, 'Sing us one of the songs of Zion!' How can we sing the songs of the LORD while in a foreign land? If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.

Remember, LORD, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell. 'Tear it down,' they cried, 'tear it down to its foundations!' Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is the one who repays you according to what you have done to us. Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.

I will praise you, LORD, with all my heart; before the 'gods' I will sing your praise. I will bow down toward your holy temple and will praise your name for your unfailing love and your faithfulness, for you have so exalted your solemn decree that it surpasses your fame. When I called, you answered me; you greatly emboldened me. May all the kings of the earth praise you, LORD, when they hear what you have decreed. May they sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great. Though the LORD is exalted, he looks kindly on the lowly; though lofty, he sees them from afar. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life. You stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes; with your right hand you save me. The LORD will vindicate me; your love, LORD, endures forever—do not abandon the works of your hands.

You have searched me, LORD, and you know me. You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways. Before a word is on my tongue, you, LORD, know it completely. You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast. If I say, 'Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,' even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you. For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well."You made me wonderfully; your works are amazing, and I know it well. My frame wasn't hidden from you when I was made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed body; all my days were written in your book before any of them came to be. How precious are your thoughts about me, God! How vast is the sum of them! If I tried to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I wake up, I am still with you.

Surely you will slay the wicked, God. Depart from me, you bloodthirsty men! They speak against you with evil intent; your enemies misuse your name. Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD, and abhor those who rise up against you? I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies. Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Rescue me, LORD, from evil men; protect me from violent men who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day. They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent's; the poison of vipers is on their lips. Keep me safe, LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from violent men who plan to trip my feet. The arrogant have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path.

I say to the LORD, "You are my God." Hear, LORD, my cry for mercy. Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, you shield my head in the day of battle. Do not grant the wicked their desires, LORD; do not let their plans succeed. Let the heads of those who surround me be covered with the trouble their lips have caused. Let burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise. May slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down the violent.

I know that the LORD secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy. Surely the righteous will praise your name, and the upright will live in your presence.

I call to you, LORD, come quickly to me; hear me when I call to you. May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. Set a guard over my mouth, LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds along with those who are evildoers; do not let me eat their delicacies. Let a righteous man strike me—that is a kindness; let him rebuke me—that is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it, for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers.

Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken. They will say, "As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave." But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death. Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers, from the snares they have laid for me. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.

I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy. I pour out before him my complaint; before him I tell my trouble. When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way. In the path where I walk, people have hidden a snare for me. Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life. I cry to you, LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living." Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.

LORD, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief. Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you. The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in the darkness like those long dead. So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed. I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done. I spread out my hands to you; I thirst for you like a parched land.

Answer me quickly, LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit. Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life. Rescue me from my enemies, LORD, for I hide myself in you. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground. For your name's sake, LORD, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble. In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.

Praise be to the LORD, my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle. He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me. LORD, what are human beings that you care for them, mere mortals that you think of them? They are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow. Part your heavens, LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke. Send forth lightning and scatter the enemy; shoot your arrows and rout them. Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.

I will sing a new song to you, my God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you, to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David. From the deadly sword deliver me; rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful. Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace. Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields; our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets. Blessed is the people of whom this is true; blessed is the people whose God is the LORD.

I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise your name for ever and ever. Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever. Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom. One generation commends your works to another; they tell of your mighty acts. They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty—and I will meditate on your wonderful works. They tell of the power of your awesome works—and I will proclaim your great deeds. They celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.

The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love. The LORD is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made. All your works praise you, LORD; your faithful people extol you. They tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might, so that all people may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. The LORD is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does. The LORD upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down. The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time. You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.

The LORD is righteous in all his ways and faithful in all he does. The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them. The LORD watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy. My mouth will speak in praise of the LORD. Let every creature praise his holy name for ever and ever.

Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD, my soul. I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live. Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save. When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing. Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD their God. He is the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them—he remains faithful forever. He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets prisoners free, the LORD gives sight to the blind, the LORD lifts up those who are bowed down, the LORD loves the righteous.The Lord protects strangers, supports orphans and widows, but he disrupts the plans of the wicked. The Lord will reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord! It is good to sing praises to our God; it is pleasant and fitting to praise him. The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem and gathers the exiles of Israel. He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name. Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit. The Lord sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground. Sing to the Lord with grateful praise; make music to our God on the harp. He covers the sky with clouds, supplies the earth with rain, and makes grass grow on the hills. He provides food for the cattle and for the young ravens when they call. His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of the warrior; the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.

Praise the Lord, Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion. He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your people within you. He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest of wheat. He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly. He spreads the snow like wool and scatters the frost like ashes. He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast? He sends his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow. He has revealed his word to Jacob, his laws and decrees to Israel. He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his laws. Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights above. Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly hosts. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars. Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies. Let them praise the name of the Lord, for at his command they were created, and he established them forever and ever—he issued a decree that will never pass away.

Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths, lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding, you mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds, kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and all rulers on earth, young men and women, old men and children. Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens. And he has raised up for his people a horn, the praise of all his faithful servants, of Israel, the people close to his heart. Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord. Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise in the assembly of his faithful people. Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King. Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp. For the Lord takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with victory. Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds. May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentence written against them—this is the glory of all his faithful people. Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heavens. Praise him for his acts of power; praise him for his surpassing greatness. Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre, praise him with timbrel and dancing, praise him with the strings and pipe, praise him with the clash of cymbals, praise him with resounding cymbals. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

For gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight; for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair; for giving prudence to those who are simple, knowledge and discretion to the young—let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance—for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them. If they say, “Come along with us; let’s lie in wait for innocent blood, let’s ambush some harmless soul; let’s swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder; cast lots with us; we will all share the loot”—my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths; for their feet rush into evil, they are swift to shed blood. How useless to spread a net where every bird can see it! These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves! Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the life of those who get it.

Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square; on top of the wall she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech: “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings. But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand, since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke, I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you—when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me, since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord. Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.”

My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding—indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones. Then you will understand what is right and just and fair—every good path. For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.

Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse, who have left the straight paths to walk in dark ways, who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways. Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words, who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God. Surely her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. None who go to her return or attain the paths of life. Thus you will walk in the ways of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.

My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity. Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops.Honor the Lord with your wealth and the first of your harvests. Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine. My child, do not despise the Lord's discipline or be weary of His correction, for the Lord corrects those He loves, just as a father corrects the child in whom he delights. 

Happy is the person who finds wisdom and gains understanding, for it is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. Wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her. Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, and those who hold her fast will be blessed.

By wisdom, the Lord laid the earth's foundations; by understanding, He set the heavens in place. By His knowledge, the watery depths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew. My child, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight; preserve sound judgment and discretion. They will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck. Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble. When you lie down, you will not be afraid; your sleep will be sweet. Do not fear sudden disaster or the ruin that overtakes the wicked, for the Lord will be at your side and will keep your foot from being snared.

Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it is in your power to act. Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back tomorrow and I'll give it to you," when you already have it with you. Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you. Do not accuse anyone for no reason when they have done you no harm. Do not envy the violent or choose any of their ways, for the Lord detests the perverse but takes the upright into His confidence. The Lord's curse is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous. He mocks proud mockers but shows favor to the humble and oppressed. The wise inherit honor, but fools get only shame.

Listen, my children, to a father's instruction; pay attention and gain understanding. I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching. For I too was a son to my father, still tender and cherished by my mother. Then he taught me, and he said to me, "Take hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands, and you will live. Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you. Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding. Cherish her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you. She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown."

Listen, my child, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many. I instruct you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths. When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble. Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life. Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers. Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way. For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble. They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.

The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble. My child, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it. Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.

My child, pay attention to my wisdom, turn your ear to my words of insight, that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge. For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end, she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it.

Now then, my children, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say. Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house, lest you lose your honor to others and your dignity to one who is cruel, lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another. At the end of your life, you will groan when your flesh and body are spent. You will say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction! I would not obey my teachers or turn my ear to my instructors. And I was soon in serious trouble in the assembly of God's people."

Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well. Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares? Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers. May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. A loving doe, a graceful deer—may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be intoxicated with her love. Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man's wife? Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?

For your ways are in full view of the Lord, and He examines all your paths. The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them; the cords of their sins hold them fast. For lack of discipline, they will die, led astray by their own great folly.

My child, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger, you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth. So do this, my child, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's hands: Go—to the point of exhaustion—and give your neighbor no rest! Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids. Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.

Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest. How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep? A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.

A troublemaker and a villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth, who winks maliciously with his eye, signals with his feet, and motions with his fingers, who plots evil with deceit in his heart—he always stirs up conflict. Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.

There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to Him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies, and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.

My child, keep your father's command and do not forsake your mother's teaching. Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck. When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you. For this command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and correction and instruction are the way to life, keeping you from your neighbor's wife, from the smooth talk of a wayward woman. Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes. For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, but another man's wife preys on your very life. Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned? Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched? So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.

People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving. Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house. But a man who commits adultery has no sense; whoever does so destroys himself. Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away. For jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge. He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse a bribe, however great it is.

My child, keep my words and store up my commands within you. Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye. Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and to insight, "You are my relative." They will keep you from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words.Avoid the seductive words of a deceitful woman. I saw a naive young man wandering near her house at dusk. She approached him, dressed provocatively and with a cunning heart. She was loud and rebellious, never staying at home, always lurking in the streets. She grabbed him, kissed him, and shamelessly said, "I have made my offerings and now I seek you. My bed is adorned with luxurious linens and perfumes. Come, let us enjoy love until morning, for my husband is away on a long trip."

Her enticing words led him astray, like an ox to the slaughter or a bird rushing into a trap, unaware it would cost him his life. Listen to me, children, and do not stray into her paths. Many strong men have been destroyed by her. Her house leads to death.

Wisdom calls out from high places and city gates, urging people to seek understanding. She offers valuable teachings, more precious than silver or gold. Wisdom hates evil, pride, and deceit. She provides sound advice and strength, enabling rulers to govern justly. Those who seek wisdom will find riches and honor. Wisdom existed before the world was created and delights in humanity.

Listen to wisdom and be blessed. Those who find wisdom find life and favor from the Lord, but those who reject it harm themselves.

Wisdom has built her house and prepared a feast, inviting the simple to gain understanding. Forsake foolishness and live wisely. Correcting a mocker brings shame, but rebuking a wise person earns love. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the holy brings understanding. Wisdom prolongs life, while foolishness leads to ruin.

A foolish woman is loud and ignorant, sitting at her door, calling to passersby. She tempts them with stolen pleasures, but her house leads to death.

The righteous speak valuable words, but the wicked's heart is worthless. The righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of wisdom. The Lord's blessing brings wealth without sorrow. Fools find joy in mischief, but the wise find wisdom. The wicked's fears will come true, but the righteous's desires will be granted. The wicked are swept away, but the righteous stand firm. The lazy are irritating to their employers. The fear of the Lord prolongs life, but the wicked's years are shortened. The righteous's hope brings joy, but the wicked's expectations perish. The Lord's way is a refuge for the upright, but destruction for the wicked. The righteous will never be uprooted, but the wicked will not remain.

The integrity of the righteous guides them, but the wicked fall by their own wickedness. When a wicked person dies, their hopes perish, but the righteous are delivered from trouble. A hypocrite destroys their neighbor with their words, but the just are saved through knowledge. When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish, there is celebration. The city is uplifted by the blessings of the upright but is overthrown by the wicked's words. A person lacking wisdom despises their neighbor, but a person of understanding remains silent. A gossip reveals secrets, but a faithful person keeps matters confidential. Without guidance, people fall, but there is safety in many advisors. Guaranteeing a loan for a stranger brings trouble, but avoiding such guarantees ensures security. A gracious woman retains honor, and strong men retain wealth. A kind person benefits their own soul, but a cruel person brings trouble to themselves. The wicked earn deceitful wages, but those who sow righteousness receive a true reward. Righteousness leads to life, while pursuing evil leads to death. Those with a perverse heart are detestable to the Lord, but the upright are His delight. The wicked will not go unpunished, but the descendants of the righteous will be delivered. A beautiful woman without discretion is like a gold ring in a pig's snout. The righteous desire only good, but the wicked expect wrath. Generosity leads to increase, while withholding more than necessary leads to poverty. A generous person will prosper, and those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed. People curse those who hoard grain, but blessings come to those who sell it. Seeking good brings favor, but seeking mischief brings trouble. Trusting in riches leads to a fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf. Troubling one's own household brings inheritance of the wind, and fools become servants to the wise. The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and those who win souls are wise. The righteous will be rewarded on earth, and even more so the wicked and sinners.

Loving instruction leads to knowledge, but hating correction is foolish. A good person gains favor from the Lord, but the Lord condemns those with wicked schemes. Wickedness cannot establish a person, but the righteous have deep roots. A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband, but a disgraceful woman is like decay in his bones.

Those who work their land will have plenty of food, but those who chase fantasies lack sense. The wicked desire the plunder of evil men, but the root of the righteous yields fruit. The wicked are trapped by their sinful talk, but the righteous escape trouble. Good things come from the fruit of one's mouth, and the work of one's hands brings reward. A fool thinks their way is right, but a wise person listens to advice. A fool's anger is quickly known, but a prudent person overlooks an insult. Speaking the truth shows righteousness, but a false witness shows deceit. Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment. Deceit fills the hearts of those who plot evil, but joy comes to those who promote peace. No harm befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble. The Lord detests lying lips, but delights in those who are truthful. A prudent person conceals knowledge, but the heart of fools proclaims folly. Diligent hands will rule, but laziness leads to forced labor. Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up. The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray. The lazy do not roast their game, but the diligent make use of their possessions. In the way of righteousness there is life; along that path is immortality.

A wise child listens to their parent's instruction, but a mocker does not respond to rebukes. Good things come from the fruit of one's mouth, but the unfaithful crave violence. Those who guard their lips preserve their lives, but those who speak rashly come to ruin. The sluggard craves and gets nothing, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied. The righteous hate what is false, but the wicked bring shame and disgrace. Righteousness guards the person of integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner.

The days of the afflicted are miserable, but a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast. It's better to have little with reverence for the Lord than great wealth with turmoil.

The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of disaster. The Lord detests the proud; they will not go unpunished. Mercy and truth atone for wrongdoing, and reverence for the Lord keeps one from evil. When the Lord is pleased with someone's ways, He makes even their enemies live at peace with them. Better to have little with righteousness than much with injustice. Humans plan their course, but the Lord directs their steps. A king's words are authoritative; his judgments are just. Honest scales and balances belong to the Lord; all the weights in the bag are of His making. Kings detest wrongdoing, for their throne is established by righteousness. Righteous lips are a king's delight; they love those who speak rightly. A king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise person will appease it. The light of a king's face brings life, and his favor is like a rain cloud in spring. Wisdom is better than gold, and understanding is more valuable than silver. The path of the upright avoids evil; those who guard their way preserve their lives. Pride leads to destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. It's better to be humble with the lowly than to share plunder with the proud. Those who handle matters wisely find good, and those who trust in the Lord are happy. The wise in heart are called discerning, and pleasant words promote instruction. Understanding is a fountain of life to those who have it, but folly brings punishment to fools. The wise heart instructs the mouth and adds learning to the lips. Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones. There is a way that seems right to a person, but it ends in death. The laborer's appetite works for them; their hunger drives them on. A scoundrel plots evil, and their speech is like a scorching fire. A perverse person stirs up conflict, and a gossip separates close friends. A violent person entices their neighbor and leads them down a path that is not good. They close their eyes to plot evil and press their lips to bring it to pass. Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is gained by living a righteous life. Better to be patient than powerful; better to have self-control than to conquer a city. The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord. Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting with strife. A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son and will share the inheritance as one of the family. The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests the heart. A wicked person listens to deceitful lips; a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue. Mocking the poor shows contempt for their Maker; rejoicing at disaster will not go unpunished. Children's children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children. Eloquent words are not fitting for a fool; how much less lying lips for a ruler! A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the giver; wherever they turn, they succeed. Whoever covers an offense seeks love, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends. A rebuke impresses a discerning person more than a hundred lashes a fool. An evil person seeks only rebellion; a cruel messenger will be sent against them. Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in their folly. If you repay good with evil, evil will never leave your house. Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out. Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent—both are detestable to the Lord. Why should fools have money in hand to buy wisdom, when they are not able to understand it? A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity. One who has no sense shakes hands in pledge and puts up security for a neighbor. Whoever loves a quarrel loves sin; whoever builds a high gate invites destruction. One whose heart is corrupt does not prosper; one whose tongue is perverse falls into trouble. A foolish child brings grief to their father and bitterness to the mother who bore them. It is not good to punish the innocent or to flog officials for their integrity. The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint, and whoever has understanding is even-tempered. Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues.A person who keeps quiet is considered wise. Someone who isolates themselves seeks their own desires and goes against all sound judgment. A fool takes no pleasure in understanding but only in expressing their own opinions. When the wicked arrive, so does contempt, and with dishonor comes disgrace. The words of a person's mouth are deep waters, and the fountain of wisdom is a flowing brook. It is not good to show partiality to the wicked or to deprive the righteous of justice. A fool's lips bring strife, and their mouth invites a beating. A fool's mouth is their ruin, and their lips are a trap for their soul. The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts. A lazy person is a brother to a destroyer. The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe. The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it a high wall of safety. Before a downfall, the heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor. To answer before listening—that is folly and shame. The human spirit can endure in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear? The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out. A gift opens the way and ushers the giver into the presence of the great. In a lawsuit, the first to speak seems right until someone comes forward and cross-examines. Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart. A brother wronged is more unyielding than a fortified city; disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel. From the fruit of their mouth, a person's stomach is filled; with the harvest of their lips, they are satisfied. The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit. He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord. The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly. One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. Better the poor whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse. Desire without knowledge is not good—how much more will hasty feet miss the way! A person's own folly leads to their ruin, yet their heart rages against the Lord. Wealth attracts many friends, but even the closest friend of the poor deserts them. A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will not go free. Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts. The poor are shunned by all their relatives—how much more do their friends avoid them! Though the poor pursue them with pleading, they are nowhere to be found. The one who gets wisdom loves life; the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper. A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish. It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury—how much worse for a slave to rule over princes! A person's wisdom yields patience; it is to one's glory to overlook an offense. A king's rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. A foolish child is a father's ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like the constant dripping of a leaky roof. Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the Lord. Laziness brings on deep sleep, and the shiftless go hungry. Whoever keeps commandments keeps their life, but whoever shows contempt for their ways will die. Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will reward them for what they have done. Discipline your children, for in that there is hope; do not be a willing party to their death. A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty; rescue them, and you will have to do it again. Listen to advice and accept discipline, and at the end, you will be counted among the wise. Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails. What a person desires is unfailing love; better to be poor than a liar. The fear of the Lord leads to life; then one rests content, untouched by trouble. The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth! Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke the discerning, and they will gain knowledge. Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother is a child who brings shame and disgrace. Stop listening to instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge. A corrupt witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil. Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools. Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise. A king's wrath strikes terror like the roar of a lion; those who anger him forfeit their lives. It is to one's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel. Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time, they look but find nothing. The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out. Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find? The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them. When a king sits on his throne to judge, he winnows out all evil with his eyes. Who can say, "I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without sin"? Differing weights and differing measures—the Lord detests them both. Even small children are known by their actions, so is their conduct really pure and upright? Ears that hear and eyes that see—the Lord has made them both. Do not love sleep, or you will grow poor; stay awake, and you will have food to spare. "It's no good, it's no good!" says the buyer—then goes off and boasts about the purchase. Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel. Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider. Food gained by fraud tastes sweet, but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel. Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance. A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid anyone who talks too much. If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness. An inheritance claimed too soon will not be blessed at the end. Do not say, "I'll pay you back for this wrong!" Wait for the Lord, and he will avenge you. The Lord detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him. A person's steps are directed by the Lord. How then can anyone understand their own way? It is a trap to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider one's vows. A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them. The human spirit is the lamp of the Lord that sheds light on one's inmost being. Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love, his throne is made secure. The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old. Blows and wounds scrub away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being. In the Lord's hand, the king's heart is a stream of water that he channels toward all who please him. A person may think their own ways are right, but the Lord weighs the heart. To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. Haughty eyes and a proud heart—the unplowed field of the wicked—produce sin. The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty. A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare. The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right. The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright. Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. The wicked crave evil; their neighbors get no mercy from them. When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; by paying attention to the wise, they get knowledge. The Righteous One takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin. Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered. A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers. Whoever strays from the path of prudence comes to rest in the company of the dead. Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich. The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright. Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife. The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down. Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity, and honor. One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty and pull down the stronghold in which they trust.Keep your words and actions in check to avoid trouble. Arrogant people are known for their pride and anger. Laziness leads to ruin because it avoids hard work. The lazy person craves all day but gives nothing, while the righteous are generous. Sacrifices made with evil intentions are detestable. A false witness will perish, but a truthful person speaks consistently. The wicked are stubborn, but the upright are guided by integrity. No wisdom or plan can succeed against the Lord. Preparation is important, but true safety comes from the Lord.

A good reputation is more valuable than wealth, and favor is better than silver or gold. Both rich and poor are created by the Lord. A wise person sees danger and avoids it, but the naive continue and suffer. Humility and reverence for the Lord bring wealth, honor, and life. The path of the wicked is filled with thorns and traps; those who protect their soul stay away from it. Teach children the right way, and they will not stray when they grow up. The rich rule over the poor, and borrowers are servants to lenders. Those who sow injustice will reap disaster, and their anger will fail. Generous people are blessed because they share with the poor. Remove mockers, and conflict will disappear. Those who love purity and speak graciously will be friends with the king. The Lord preserves knowledge and overthrows the words of the unfaithful. The lazy person makes excuses and avoids work. The seductive words of immoral people are a trap; those who anger the Lord will fall into it. Foolishness is bound in a child's heart, but discipline drives it away. Oppressing the poor to increase wealth or giving to the rich leads to poverty.

Listen to wise words and apply them to your heart. Keeping these teachings will be beneficial and trustworthy. Do not exploit the poor or oppress the afflicted, for the Lord will defend them and punish their oppressors. Avoid associating with angry people, as you may learn their ways and fall into a trap. Do not co-sign for debts if you cannot repay, or you may lose everything. Respect the boundaries set by your ancestors. Diligent people will stand before kings, not obscure individuals.

When dining with a ruler, be mindful of your behavior. Do not crave their delicacies, as they are deceptive. Do not exhaust yourself to become rich; wealth can disappear quickly. Avoid the food of stingy people, as their hearts are not with you. The food you eat will make you sick, and you will regret your kind words. Do not waste wisdom on fools, as they will despise it. Respect the property of others and do not encroach on the fields of the fatherless, for their defender is strong and will take up their cause.

Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to knowledge. Do not withhold discipline from children; correcting them will save their souls. If your heart is wise, it will bring joy to your parents. Do not envy sinners, but always revere the Lord. There is a future hope, and your expectations will not be cut off. Listen and be wise, and guide your heart in the right path. Avoid excessive drinking and gluttony, as they lead to poverty. Respect your parents and do not despise them in their old age. Value truth, wisdom, instruction, and understanding. A righteous child brings joy to their parents. Give your heart to wisdom and observe the right ways. Immoral people are like deep pits, and those who anger the Lord will fall into them. Excessive drinking leads to sorrow, conflict, and regret. Do not be envious of evil people or desire their company, for their hearts plot destruction.

Wisdom builds a house, and understanding establishes it. Knowledge fills its rooms with precious treasures. A wise person is strong, and knowledge increases strength. Seek wise counsel for success. Wisdom is beyond the reach of fools, and they remain silent in important matters. Those who plot evil are called schemers. Foolish thoughts are sinful, and mockers are detested. If you falter in adversity, your strength is small. Rescue those being led to death and do not ignore their plight. The Lord knows your heart and will repay everyone according to their deeds. Enjoy wisdom as you would honey, for it brings a sweet reward. Do not ambush the homes of the righteous, for they will rise again, but the wicked will fall into trouble. Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, or the Lord will disapprove and turn away His wrath. Do not envy the wicked, for they have no future. Fear the Lord and the king, and do not associate with rebels, for their destruction will come suddenly.

These sayings also belong to the wise: Showing partiality in judgment is not good. Those who justify the wicked will be cursed, but those who rebuke them will be blessed. Honest answers are like a kiss on the lips. Prepare your work outside and get your fields ready; then build your house. Do not testify against your neighbor without cause or deceive with your words. Do not seek revenge, but trust the Lord to repay. Observing the field of a lazy person teaches the consequences of neglect. A little sleep and laziness lead to poverty.It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the honor of kings is to search them out. The heavens are high, the earth is deep, and the hearts of kings are unsearchable. Remove impurities from silver, and a vessel for the silversmith will emerge. Remove the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne will be established in righteousness. Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence or stand in the place of great men. It is better to be invited up than to be humiliated in front of the prince.

Do not rush into a dispute, or you may not know what to do when your neighbor puts you to shame. Discuss your case with your neighbor directly and do not reveal another's secret, or you may be shamed, and your reputation ruined. A well-spoken word is like apples of gold in settings of silver. A wise rebuke to an obedient ear is like a gold earring or fine jewelry. A faithful messenger refreshes the soul of those who send him, like the coolness of snow at harvest time. Boasting about a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.

Patience can persuade a ruler, and a gentle tongue can break a bone. If you find honey, eat just enough—too much of it will make you vomit. Do not visit your neighbor's house too often, or they may grow tired of you and hate you. A false witness against your neighbor is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow. Trusting an unfaithful person in times of trouble is like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint. Singing songs to a heavy heart is like taking away a garment on a cold day or pouring vinegar on soda.

If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you. Just as the north wind brings rain, an angry look can drive away a backbiting tongue. It is better to live in a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. Good news from a distant land is like cold water to a thirsty soul. A righteous person who gives way to the wicked is like a muddied spring or a polluted well.

It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one's own glory. A person without self-control is like a city with broken-down walls. Honor is not fitting for a fool, just as snow in summer or rain at harvest is out of place. A curse without cause will not come to rest, like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow. A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools. Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will be like him yourself. Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes.

Sending a message by the hand of a fool is like cutting off one's feet or drinking poison. A proverb in the mouth of a fool is as useless as a lame man's legs. Honoring a fool is like tying a stone in a sling. A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like a thorn in the hand of a drunkard. The great God who formed all things rewards both the fool and the transgressor. As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly. There is more hope for a fool than for someone who is wise in their own eyes.

The lazy person says, "There is a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!" As a door turns on its hinges, so a lazy person turns on their bed. The lazy person buries their hand in the dish but is too tired to bring it back to their mouth. The lazy person is wiser in their own eyes than seven people who answer discreetly. Meddling in someone else's quarrel is like grabbing a dog by the ears. Like a madman shooting firebrands or deadly arrows is someone who deceives their neighbor and says, "I was only joking!"

Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a quarrel dies down. As charcoal to embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife. The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to the inmost parts. Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart. Enemies disguise themselves with their lips, but in their hearts, they harbor deceit. Though their speech is charming, do not believe them, for seven abominations fill their hearts. Their malice may be concealed by deception, but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.

Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them. A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruin. Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring. Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth; an outsider, and not your own lips. Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but a fool's provocation is heavier than both. Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? Better is open rebuke than hidden love. Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.

One who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet. Like a bird that flees its nest is anyone who flees from home. Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of a friend springs from their heartfelt advice. Do not forsake your friend or a friend of your family, and do not go to your relative's house when disaster strikes you—better a neighbor nearby than a relative far away. Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt. The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.

Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider. If anyone loudly blesses their neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse. A quarrelsome wife is like the dripping of a leaky roof in a rainstorm; restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand. As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another. The one who guards a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever protects their master will be honored. As water reflects the face, so one's life reflects the heart. Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are human eyes.

The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but people are tested by their praise. Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them. Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds; for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations. When the hay is removed, and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in, the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field. You will have plenty of goats' milk to feed your family and to nourish your female servants.

The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion. When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a ruler with discernment and knowledge maintains order. A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. Those who forsake instruction praise the wicked, but those who heed it resist them. Evildoers do not understand what is right, but those who seek the Lord understand it fully. Better the poor whose walk is blameless than the rich whose ways are perverse. A discerning son heeds instruction, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.

Whoever increases wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor. If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction, even their prayers are detestable. Whoever leads the upright along an evil path will fall into their own trap, but the blameless will receive a good inheritance. The rich are wise in their own eyes; one who is poor and discerning sees how deluded they are. When the righteous triumph, there is great elation; but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding. Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. Blessed is the one who always trembles before God, but whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble.

Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people. A tyrannical ruler practices extortion, but one who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long reign. Anyone tormented by the guilt of murder will seek refuge in the grave; let no one hold them back. The one whose walk is blameless is kept safe, but the one whose ways are perverse will fall into the pit. Those who work their land will have abundant food, but those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty. A faithful person will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. Showing partiality is not good.Don't be quick to get rich; it leads to trouble. Correcting someone is better than flattering them. Stealing from your parents and saying it's not wrong is like being a destroyer. Proud people cause conflict, but those who trust in the Lord will prosper. Trusting only in yourself is foolish; walking wisely brings safety. Giving to the poor ensures you won't lack, but ignoring them brings curses. When the wicked rise, people hide, but when they fall, the righteous thrive.

If you keep ignoring correction, you'll be destroyed without remedy. When good people lead, everyone is happy; when the wicked rule, people suffer. Loving wisdom makes your parents proud, but wasting money on foolish things brings shame. A fair king strengthens the land, but one who takes bribes destroys it. Flattering your neighbor sets a trap for them. Evil actions ensnare the wicked, but the righteous rejoice. The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked don't.

Mockers stir up a city, but the wise calm anger. Arguing with a fool gets you nowhere. Bloodthirsty people hate the upright, but the just seek their well-being. Fools speak their minds, but the wise keep it in until later. If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked. The poor and the oppressor have this in common: the Lord gives sight to both. A fair king ensures his throne lasts forever. Discipline and correction bring wisdom, but a child left undisciplined brings shame to their mother.

When the wicked increase, so does sin, but the righteous will see their downfall. Correct your child, and they will give you peace and delight. Without vision, people perish, but those who follow the law are happy. Words alone won't correct a servant; they need more than just understanding. Quick-tempered people cause trouble, and those who are easily angered commit many sins. Pride brings a person low, but humility brings honor. Partnering with a thief harms your own soul; you hear the curse but don't report it.

Fear of others traps you, but trusting in the Lord keeps you safe. Many seek the ruler's favor, but true justice comes from the Lord. The unjust are detestable to the righteous, and the upright are detestable to the wicked.

The words of Agur, son of Jakeh, spoken to Ithiel and Ucal: "I am the most ignorant of men; I lack human understanding. I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One. Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know! Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.

Two things I ask of you, Lord; do not refuse me before I die: Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the Lord?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.

Do not slander a servant to their master, or they will curse you, and you will pay for it. There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers; those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth; those whose eyes are ever so haughty, whose glances are so disdainful; those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among mankind.

The leech has two daughters. 'Give! Give!' they cry. There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, 'Enough!': the grave, the barren womb, land, which is never satisfied with water, and fire, which never says, 'Enough!'

The eye that mocks a father, that scorns an aged mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures.

There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand: the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman.

This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, 'I've done nothing wrong.'

Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up: a servant who becomes king, a godless fool who gets plenty to eat, a contemptible woman who gets married, and a servant who displaces her mistress.

Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise: ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer; hyraxes are creatures of little power, yet they make their home in the crags; locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks; a lizard can be caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.

There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing: a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing; a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king secure against revolt.

If you play the fool and exalt yourself, or if you plan evil, clap your hand over your mouth! For as churning cream produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife."

The sayings of King Lemuel—an inspired utterance his mother taught him: "Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb! Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers! Do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings. It is not for kings, Lemuel—it is not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer, lest they drink and forget what has been decreed, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights. Let beer be for those who are perishing, wine for those who are in anguish! Let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.

Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."

A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants. She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings, she plants a vineyard. She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. In her hand, she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. She makes linen garments and sells them and supplies the merchants with sashes. She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: 'Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.' Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate."

The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem: "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless." What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the sun? Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever. The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises. The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.All the rivers flow into the sea, but the sea is never full. The rivers return to where they came from. Everything is wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing. What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time. No one remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them.

I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted. I said to myself, "Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge." Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.

I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless. "Laughter," I said, "is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?" I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives. I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man's heart. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.

I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil. Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.

Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done? I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness. The wise have eyes in their heads, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both. Then I said to myself, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said to myself, "This too is meaningless." For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered; the days have already come when both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die!

So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.

A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.

What do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God. I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him. Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.

And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment—wickedness was there, in the place of justice—wickedness was there. I said to myself, "God will bring into judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time to judge every deed." I also said to myself, "As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless. All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return. Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?" So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?

Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed—and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors—and they have no comforter. And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun. And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person's envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves. Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.

Again I saw something meaningless under the sun: There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless—a miserable business!

Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.

Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning. The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom. I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor. There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."Everything is vanity and vexation of spirit. Be careful when you go to the house of God; be more ready to listen than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not realize they are doing evil. Do not be quick with your mouth or hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven, and you are on earth, so let your words be few. Dreams come from much activity, and a fool's voice is known by many words. When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vows. It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it. Do not let your mouth lead you into sin, and do not protest to the temple messenger, 'My vow was a mistake.' Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands? Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore, fear God.

If you see the poor oppressed in a district and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still. The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields. Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless. As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them? The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but the abundance of the rich permits them no sleep.

I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners, or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when they have children there is nothing left for them to inherit. Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands. This too is a grievous evil: As everyone comes, so they depart, and what do they gain, since they toil for the wind? All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, affliction, and anger.

This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink, and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God. They seldom reflect on the days of their life because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart.

I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind: God gives some people wealth, possessions, and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil. A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man—even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?

Everyone’s toil is for their mouth, yet their appetite is never satisfied. What advantage have the wise over fools? What do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before others? Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

Whatever exists has already been named, and what humanity is has been known; no one can contend with someone who is stronger. The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone? For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days they pass through like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone?

A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth. It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of everyone; the living should take this to heart. Frustration is better than laughter because a sad face is good for the heart. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure. It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person than to listen to the song of fools. Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.

Extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart. The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride. Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools. Do not say, 'Why were the old days better than these?' For it is not wise to ask such questions. Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun. Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it.

Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked? When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, no one can discover anything about their future.

In this meaningless life of mine, I have seen both of these: the righteous perishing in their righteousness, and the wicked living long in their wickedness. Do not be over-righteous, neither be overwise—why destroy yourself? Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool—why die before your time? It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.

Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city. Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins. Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you—for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.

All this I tested by wisdom and I said, 'I am determined to be wise'—but this was beyond me. Whatever exists is far off and most profound—who can discover it? So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly.

I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare. 'Look,' says the Teacher, 'this is what I have discovered: Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—while I was still searching but not finding—I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all. This only have I found: God created mankind upright, but they have gone in search of many schemes.'

Who is like the wise? Who knows the explanation of things? A person’s wisdom brightens their face and changes its hard appearance. Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God. Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases. Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, 'What are you doing?' Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure. For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person may be weighed down by misery. Since no one knows the future, who can tell someone else what is to come? No one has power over the wind to contain it; so no one has power over the time of their death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.

All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt. Then too, I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless. When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong. Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.

There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun. When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night—"In life, everyone faces the same fate, whether they are righteous or wicked, good or bad, clean or unclean. This is a troubling reality, as people's hearts are full of evil and madness while they live, and then they die. However, as long as someone is alive, there is hope; a living dog is better than a dead lion. The living know they will die, but the dead know nothing and are forgotten. Their love, hate, and envy have perished, and they no longer have a part in anything done under the sun.

So, enjoy your life: eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God has already approved your works. Always wear white clothes and keep your head anointed. Live joyfully with the spouse you love all the days of your fleeting life, for this is your portion in life and in your labor under the sun. Whatever you find to do, do it with all your might, for there is no work, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave where you are going.

I observed that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor food to the wise, nor wealth to the intelligent, nor favor to the skillful; but time and chance happen to them all. No one knows when their time will come, like fish caught in a cruel net or birds trapped in a snare, so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.

I also saw wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me. There was a small city with few people, and a powerful king came against it, surrounded it, and built huge siege works against it. Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But no one remembered that poor man. So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." Nevertheless, the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heeded. The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.

Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a foul odor; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. Even as fools walk along the road, they lack sense and show everyone how foolish they are. If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great offenses to rest.

There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler: fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones. I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves. Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them. If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed, but skill will bring success. If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee.

The words of the wise bring them favor, but the lips of fools consume them. The beginning of their words is folly, and the end is wicked madness. Fools multiply words. No one knows what is coming—who can tell someone else what will happen after them? The toil of fools wearies them; they do not know the way to town.

Woe to the land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning. Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness. Through laziness, the rafters sag; because of idle hands, the house leaks. A feast is made for laughter, wine makes life merry, and money is the answer for everything. Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird in the sky may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.

Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again. Give portions to seven, yes to eight, for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land. If clouds are full of water, they pour rain on the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there it will lie. Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap. As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things. Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let your hands not be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.

Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun. However many years anyone may live, let them enjoy them all. But let them remember the days of darkness, for there will be many. Everything to come is meaningless. You who are young, be happy while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment. So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.

Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them"—before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain; when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim; when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when people rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint; when people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets. Remember him—before the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel broken at the well, and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.

"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Everything is meaningless!"

Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs. The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true. The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd. Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.

Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.Your cheeks are lovely with rows of jewels, and your neck with chains of gold. We will make you ornaments of gold with studs of silver. While the king sits at his table, my perfume sends forth its fragrance. My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh that lies all night between my breasts. My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En Gedi. Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are like doves. Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful: our bed is green. The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters are pine.

I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. Sustain me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love. His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me. I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the does of the field, that you do not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.

The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he stands behind our wall; he looks in at the windows, showing himself through the lattice. My beloved spoke and said to me, "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For behold, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell. Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely."

Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom. My beloved is mine, and I am his; he grazes among the lilies. Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.

By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but I did not find him. I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him. The watchmen found me as they went about the city. "Have you seen him whom my soul loves?" Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, into the chamber of her who conceived me. I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the does of the field, that you do not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.

Who is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of the merchant? Behold, it is the litter of Solomon! Around it are sixty mighty men, some of the mighty men of Israel, all of them wearing swords and expert in war, each with his sword at his thigh, against terror by night. King Solomon made himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon. He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior was inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem. Go out, O daughters of Zion, and look upon King Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the gladness of his heart.

Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead. Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and not one among them has lost its young. Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. Your neck is like the tower of David, built in rows of stone; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors. Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that graze among the lilies. Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will go away to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense. You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.

Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards. You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace. How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice! Your lips drip nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon. A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed. Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard, nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices—a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.

Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden, let its spices flow. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits.

I came to my garden, my sister, my bride, I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!

I slept, but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night." I had put off my garment; how could I put it on? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them? My beloved put his hand to the latch, and my heart was thrilled within me. I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the bolt. I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer. The watchmen found me as they went about in the city; they beat me, they bruised me, they took away my veil, those watchmen of the walls. I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am sick with love.

What is your beloved more than another beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us?

My beloved is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand. His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven. His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, bathed in milk, sitting beside a full pool. His cheeks are like beds of spices, mounds of sweet-smelling herbs. His lips are lilies, dripping liquid myrrh. His arms are rods of gold, set with jewels. His body is polished ivory, bedecked with sapphires. His legs are alabaster columns, set on bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars. His mouth is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?

My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies. I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies.

You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead. Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins; not one among them has lost its young. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number. My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.

Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?

I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom. Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince. Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you. Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?

How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand. Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies. Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. Your neck is like an ivory tower.Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus. Your head is like Mount Carmel, and your hair is like royal purple; the king is captivated by its beauty. How beautiful and delightful you are, my love, with all your charms! Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters of fruit. I said, "I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit." May your breasts be like clusters of grapes, and the fragrance of your breath like apples. Your mouth is like the best wine, flowing smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth.

I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me. Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside, let us spend the night in the villages. Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom—there I will give you my love. The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, both new and old, that I have stored up for you, my beloved.

If only you were like a brother to me, who nursed at my mother's breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me. I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house—she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates. His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me. Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.

Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth. Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of one's house for love, it would be utterly scorned.

We have a little sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for? If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar. I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment. Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver. But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.

You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice! Come away, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.

The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah:

Hear me, you heavens! Listen, earth! For the Lord has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. The ox knows its master, the donkey its owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."

Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the Lord; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness—only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with olive oil.

Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. Daughter Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege. Unless the Lord Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.

Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah! "The multitude of your sacrifices—what are they to me?" says the Lord. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations—I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood!

Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong. Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.

"Come now, let us settle the matter," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land; but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

See how the faithful city has become a prostitute! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her—but now murderers! Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. Your rulers are rebels, partners with thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.

Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. I will restore your leaders as in days of old, your rulers as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."

Zion will be delivered with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the Lord will perish. "You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."

This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:

In the last days the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.

Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord. You, Lord, have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and embrace pagan customs. Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots. Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made. So people will be brought low and everyone humbled—do not forgive them.

Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty! The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled and human pride brought low; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.

The Lord Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled), for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan, for all the towering mountains and all the high hills, for every lofty tower and every fortified wall, for every trading ship and every stately vessel. The arrogance of man will be brought low and human pride humbled; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day, and the idols will totally disappear.

People will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth. In that day people will throw away to the moles and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship."People will hide in caves and rocky crevices, terrified of the Lord's presence and the splendor of His majesty when He rises to shake the earth. Stop relying on mere humans, who are as frail as breath. Why should they be esteemed?

The Lord, the Almighty, will take away from Jerusalem and Judah their support and supply of food and water. He will remove the mighty warriors, judges, prophets, elders, captains, dignitaries, counselors, skilled craftsmen, and eloquent speakers. Children will become their leaders, and immature people will rule over them. Everyone will oppress each other—neighbors against neighbors, the young against the old, and the lowly against the honorable.

A man will seize his brother in his father's house, saying, 'You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins.' But he will reply, 'I cannot help you. I have no food or clothing in my house. Do not make me the leader of the people.'

Jerusalem is collapsing, and Judah is falling because their words and actions are against the Lord, defying His glorious presence. Their expressions testify against them; they parade their sin like Sodom, not hiding it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.

Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds. But woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them; they will be repaid for what their hands have done. Children oppress my people, and women rule over them. My people, your guides mislead you and confuse the direction of your paths.

The Lord takes His place in court; He rises to judge the people. The Lord enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of His people: 'It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses. What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?' declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.

The Lord says, 'Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, walking with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, strutting along with swaying hips, with ornaments jingling on their ankles, the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the daughters of Zion; the Lord will make their scalps bald.'

In that day, the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, the earrings and bracelets and veils, the headdresses and anklets and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, the signet rings and nose rings, the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls. Instead of fragrance, there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.

Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle. The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground. In that day, seven women will take hold of one man and say, 'We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!'

In that day, the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel. Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem. The Lord will wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion; He will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire. Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over everything, the glory will be a canopy. It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain."Isaiah saw a vision of the Lord and felt unworthy because of his unclean lips. A seraphim touched his lips with a live coal from the altar, cleansing him of his sins. Then, the Lord asked, "Whom shall I send?" Isaiah responded, "Here I am, send me." The Lord instructed Isaiah to deliver a message to the people, warning them that they would hear but not understand, see but not perceive, and their hearts would be hardened. Isaiah asked how long this would last, and the Lord replied, "Until the cities are ruined and deserted."

In the days of King Ahaz of Judah, Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem but failed. The Lord told Isaiah to meet Ahaz and reassure him not to fear these enemies. The Lord promised that their plans would not succeed. He also offered Ahaz a sign, but Ahaz refused to ask for one. The Lord then declared that a virgin would conceive and bear a son named Immanuel, who would eat butter and honey and know to reject evil and choose good. Before this child grows up, the lands of the two kings Ahaz fears will be deserted.

The Lord warned that He would bring upon Judah a time of great distress, worse than any since Ephraim separated from Judah. He would summon the armies of Assyria and Egypt, who would invade and devastate the land. In that day, people would struggle to survive, and the once fertile land would become overrun with briers and thorns.

The Lord instructed Isaiah to write on a large scroll about Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, a name symbolizing the swift plunder of Damascus and Samaria by the Assyrians. Isaiah's wife bore a son, and the Lord confirmed that before the child could speak, the wealth of these cities would be taken by the Assyrians.

The Lord warned that because the people rejected His gentle guidance and rejoiced in their alliances, He would bring the powerful Assyrian army against them, flooding the land like a river. Despite their plans and alliances, they would be shattered because God was with His people.

The Lord instructed Isaiah not to follow the ways of the people, not to fear what they fear, but to regard the Lord as holy. He would be a sanctuary for some but a stumbling block for others. Isaiah was to seal the testimony and wait for the Lord, who had hidden His face from Jacob.

Isaiah and his children were signs from the Lord to Israel. He warned against seeking guidance from mediums and wizards, urging the people to seek their God instead. Those who did not speak according to God's word had no light in them and would face distress and darkness.

Despite the darkness, a great light would shine on those living in the shadow of death. The nation would rejoice as in a bountiful harvest. The Lord would break the yoke of their oppressors, and a child would be born, called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His government and peace would have no end, established with justice and righteousness forever.

The Lord sent a message to Jacob, and it fell upon Israel. Despite their pride and defiance, the Lord would raise adversaries against them. The Syrians and Philistines would devour Israel, yet the Lord's anger would not subside. The people did not turn to the Lord, so He would cut off their leaders and continue His judgment.The leaders of Israel, both the respected and the deceitful prophets, are causing the people to go astray, leading to their destruction. Because of this, the Lord will not take joy in their young men or show mercy to their orphans and widows, as everyone is corrupt and speaks foolishness. Despite this, His anger remains, and His hand is still raised against them.

Wickedness burns like a fire, consuming everything in its path, including the forest thickets, and rising like smoke. The land is darkened by the Lord's wrath, and people become fuel for the fire, showing no mercy to each other. They will be hungry and unsatisfied, even turning against their own kin. Manasseh and Ephraim will unite against Judah, but the Lord's anger will not subside.

Woe to those who make unjust laws and oppress the needy, robbing the poor, widows, and orphans. When disaster strikes, they will have no one to turn to for help. Without the Lord, they will be humbled among the prisoners and the slain, yet His anger will persist.

The Lord will use the Assyrians as an instrument of His anger against a hypocritical nation. The Assyrians, though unaware, will carry out His will, destroying many nations. They boast of their conquests and riches, but they are merely tools in the Lord's hands. The Lord will eventually punish the Assyrian king for his arrogance and pride.

The Lord will send a wasting disease among the Assyrians' strong warriors, and a fire will consume their glory. The Holy One of Israel will be a flame, burning and devouring their thorns and briers in a single day. The once mighty forest and fertile fields will be reduced to a few trees, easily counted by a child.

In that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivors of Jacob will no longer rely on their oppressors but will trust in the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. Though Israel is numerous, only a remnant will return, as the Lord's righteous judgment will sweep through the land.

The Lord reassures His people in Zion not to fear the Assyrians, for their oppression will soon end. The Lord will strike the Assyrians as He did the Midianites at Oreb and as He parted the sea in Egypt. The burden and yoke of the Assyrians will be lifted from His people.

The Assyrians will advance through various towns, causing fear and flight among the inhabitants. However, the Lord will cut down the proud and mighty, humbling them and reducing their numbers.

A new leader will emerge from the lineage of Jesse, filled with the spirit of the Lord, wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. He will judge with righteousness and fairness, striking the earth with His words and slaying the wicked. Righteousness and faithfulness will be His belt.

In this new era, natural enemies will live in harmony, and the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord. The root of Jesse will stand as a signal for the nations, and the Lord will gather the scattered people of Israel from all corners of the earth. The divisions between Ephraim and Judah will end, and they will unite against their enemies.

The Lord will create a path for the remnant of His people, similar to the exodus from Egypt. In that day, the people will praise the Lord for turning away His anger and providing comfort. They will trust in the Lord, their strength and salvation, and joyfully draw from the wells of salvation. They will proclaim His deeds and exalt His name, singing praises for His excellent works known throughout the earth. The Holy One of Israel will be great among them.

Isaiah received a vision concerning Babylon. The Lord commands His sanctified ones and mighty warriors to execute His anger, causing a great commotion.The Lord of hosts is gathering a massive army from distant lands, bringing His weapons of wrath to destroy the entire land. The day of the Lord is near, bringing destruction from the Almighty. People will be terrified, their hearts will melt, and they will be in pain like a woman in labor. Faces will be aflame with fear. The day of the Lord will be cruel, filled with wrath and fierce anger, making the land desolate and destroying sinners.

The stars and constellations will not shine, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The Lord will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their sins, ending the arrogance of the proud and humbling the ruthless. People will become as rare as fine gold. The heavens will tremble, and the earth will be shaken from its place by the Lord's fierce anger.

Everyone will flee to their own land, and those who are caught will be killed. Children will be dashed to pieces, houses plundered, and wives violated. The Lord will stir up the Medes against them, who will not be swayed by silver or gold. They will mercilessly kill the young men and show no pity to children.

Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, will be overthrown like Sodom and Gomorrah. It will never be inhabited again, and wild animals will live there. The Lord will have mercy on Jacob and choose Israel again, settling them in their own land. Strangers will join them and become part of the house of Jacob. Israel will take their captors captive and rule over their oppressors.

On the day the Lord gives them rest from sorrow and bondage, they will taunt the king of Babylon, saying, "How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!" The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of rulers. The one who struck people in anger and ruled nations with wrath is now persecuted, and no one hinders.

The whole earth is at rest and quiet, breaking into singing. Even the trees rejoice, saying that no one comes to cut them down. The realm of the dead is stirred to meet the fallen king, and the spirits of the dead rise to greet him. They will say, "Have you become as weak as us? Have you become like us?" His pomp is brought down to the grave, and worms cover him.

Lucifer, son of the morning, has fallen from heaven and is cut down to the ground. He once said in his heart, "I will ascend to heaven, exalt my throne above the stars of God, and sit on the mount of the congregation." But he is brought down to the pit. Those who see him will wonder if this is the man who made the earth tremble and shook kingdoms.

All the kings of the nations lie in glory, each in his own house, but he is cast out of his grave like a rejected branch. He is covered with the slain, thrust through with a sword, and trampled underfoot. He will not be joined with them in burial because he destroyed his land and killed his people. The offspring of evildoers will never be renowned.

Prepare to slaughter his children for the sins of their fathers, so they do not rise and possess the land or fill the world with cities. The Lord will rise against them, cutting off Babylon's name and remnant. He will make it a possession for wild animals and sweep it with the broom of destruction.

The Lord of hosts has sworn that His plans will come to pass. He will break the Assyrian in His land and trample him on His mountains, lifting the burden from His people. This is the purpose for the whole earth, and no one can annul it.

In the year King Ahaz died, this burden was given. Do not rejoice, Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken. From the serpent's root will come a viper, and its offspring will be a fiery flying serpent. The poor will feed, and the needy will lie down in safety, but the Lord will destroy the root with famine and kill the remnant.

Cry out, O gate; wail, O city; all of Philistia is dissolved. A smoke comes from the north, and no one will be alone in their appointed times. The messengers of the nation will answer that the Lord has founded Zion, and the poor of His people will trust in it.

The burden of Moab: In the night, Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence. Kir of Moab is also laid waste. Moab goes up to weep at the high places, and there is baldness and cut beards on every head. In the streets, they wear sackcloth and weep abundantly. The armed soldiers of Moab cry out, and their lives are grievous to them. The waters of Nimrim are desolate, and the grass fails. The abundance they have gathered will be carried away to the brook of the willows. The cry has gone around the borders of Moab, and the waters of Dimon are full of blood. The Lord will bring more upon Dimon, including lions upon those who escape from Moab and the remnant of the land.The vine of Sibmah and the vineyards of Heshbon have been destroyed by foreign rulers. The branches of these vines reached as far as Jazer and wandered through the wilderness, even crossing the sea. Therefore, I will weep for the vine of Sibmah and water it with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh, because the joyful shouts for your summer fruits and harvest have ceased. Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards, and no one sings or shouts in the vineyards. No one treads out wine in the presses, for I have put an end to the shouting.

My heart mourns for Moab like a harp, and my innermost being for Kir Hareseth. When Moab appears at her high place, she will be exhausted and go to her sanctuary to pray, but she will not succeed. This is the word the Lord has spoken concerning Moab in the past. But now the Lord says, within three years, as a hired worker counts the years, the glory of Moab will be despised, along with all her great multitude, and only a few feeble people will remain.

The prophecy against Damascus: Damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins. The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left for flocks, which will lie down with no one to make them afraid. The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the Israelites, declares the Lord Almighty.

In that day, the glory of Jacob will fade, and the fat of his body will waste away. It will be as when reapers gather the standing grain and harvest the ears with their arms, as when someone gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim. Yet some gleanings will remain, as when an olive tree is beaten, leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches, four or five on the fruitful boughs, declares the Lord, the God of Israel.

In that day, people will look to their Maker and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel. They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands, and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles and the incense altars their fingers have made. In that day, their strong cities, which they left because of the Israelites, will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth, and all will be desolation.

You have forgotten God your Savior; you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress. Therefore, though you set out the finest plants and plant imported vines, though on the day you set them out, you make them grow, and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud, yet the harvest will be as nothing in the day of disease and incurable pain.

Woe to the many nations that rage—they rage like the raging sea! Woe to the peoples who roar—they roar like the roaring of great waters! Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters, when he rebukes them, they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills, like tumbleweed before a gale. In the evening, sudden terror! Before the morning, they are gone. This is the portion of those who loot us, the lot of those who plunder us.

Woe to the land of whirring wings along the rivers of Cush, which sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats over the water. Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers. All you people of the world, you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when a trumpet sounds, you will hear it. This is what the Lord says to me: I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives and cut down and take away the spreading branches. They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, the wild animals all winter.

At that time, gifts will be brought to the Lord Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers—the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the Lord Almighty.

A prophecy against Egypt: See, the Lord rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear. I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian—brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom. The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will bring their plans to nothing; they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, the mediums and the spiritists. I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them, declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.

The waters of the river will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and dry. The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds and rushes will wither, also the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river. Every sown field along the Nile will become parched, will blow away, and be no more. The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who throw nets on the water will pine away. Those who work with combed flax will despair, the weavers of fine linen will lose hope. The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.

The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am one of the wise men, a disciple of the ancient kings"? Where are your wise men now? Let them show you and make known what the Lord Almighty has planned against Egypt. The officials of Zoan have become fools, the leaders of Memphis are deceived; the cornerstones of her peoples have led Egypt astray. The Lord has poured into them a spirit of dizziness; they make Egypt stagger in all that she does, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit. There is nothing Egypt can do—head or tail, palm branch or reed.

In that day, the Egyptians will become weaklings. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the Lord Almighty raises against them. And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified because of what the Lord Almighty is planning against them.

In that day, five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the Lord Almighty. One of them will be called the City of the Sun. In that day, there will be an altar to the Lord in the heart of Egypt and a monument to the Lord at its border. It will be a sign and witness to the Lord Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the Lord because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them. So the Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day, they will acknowledge the Lord. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the Lord and keep them. The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the Lord, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.

In that day, there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. In that day, Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance."

In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it, at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, "Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet." And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.

Then the Lord said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush, so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared—to Egypt's shame. Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and put to shame. In that day, the people who live on this coast will say, 'See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?'"

A prophecy against the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror. A dire vision has been shown to me:The treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, Elam; besiege, Media; I have put an end to all their groaning. My body is filled with pain, like the pain of a woman in labor. I am dismayed by what I hear and see. My heart pounds, and fear overwhelms me; the night I longed for has turned into terror. Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink; arise, you princes, and anoint the shield. The Lord said to me, "Set a watchman, let him declare what he sees." He saw a chariot with horsemen, a chariot of donkeys, and a chariot of camels; he listened carefully. Then he cried out, "A lion! My lord, I stand continually on the watchtower by day, and I am stationed every night. Look, here comes a chariot of men with horsemen." And he answered, "Babylon has fallen, and all the idols of her gods lie shattered on the ground." My people, I have told you what I heard from the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel.

A message about Dumah: Someone calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?" The watchman replies, "Morning is coming, but also the night. If you want to ask, then ask; come back again."

A message about Arabia: You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia, bring water to the thirsty; you who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives. They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle. The Lord told me, "Within a year, as a hired worker counts the years, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end. The remaining archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few." The Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken.

A message about the Valley of Vision: What troubles you now, that you have all gone up to the rooftops? You town full of commotion, you city of tumult and revelry. Your slain were not killed by the sword, nor did they die in battle. All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without using the bow. All of you who were caught were taken prisoner together, having fled while the enemy was still far away. Therefore I said, "Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people." The Lord, the Lord Almighty, has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains. Elam takes up the quiver, with her charioteers and horses; Kir uncovers the shield. Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the city gates. The defenses of Judah are stripped away. And you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest; you saw that the walls of the City of David were broken through in many places; you stored up water in the Lower Pool. You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall. You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.

The Lord, the Lord Almighty, called you on that day to weep and to wail, to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth. But see, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine! "Let us eat and drink," you say, "for tomorrow we die!" The Lord Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: "Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for," says the Lord, the Lord Almighty.

This is what the Lord, the Lord Almighty, says: "Go, say to this steward, to Shebna the palace administrator: What are you doing here and who gave you permission to cut out a grave for yourself here, hewing your grave on the height and chiseling your resting place in the rock? Beware, the Lord is about to take firm hold of you and hurl you away, you mighty man. He will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you into a large country. There you will die, and there your splendid chariots will remain—you disgrace to your master's house! I will depose you from your office, and you will be ousted from your position. In that day I will summon my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah. I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father. All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars. In that day," declares the Lord Almighty, "the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down." The Lord has spoken.

A message about Tyre: Wail, you ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus word has come to them. Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched. On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations. Be ashamed, Sidon, and you fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken: "I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters." When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre. Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island. Is this your city of revelry, the old, old city, whose feet have taken her to settle in far-off lands? Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth? The Lord Almighty planned it, to bring down her pride in all her splendor and to humble all who are renowned on the earth. Till your land as they do along the Nile, Daughter Tarshish, for you no longer have a harbor. The Lord has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia that her fortresses be destroyed. He said, "No more of your reveling, Virgin Daughter Sidon, now crushed! Up, cross over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest." Look at the land of the Babylonians, this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin. Wail, you ships of Tarshish; your fortress is destroyed!

At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute: "Take up a harp, walk through the city, you forgotten prostitute; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered." At the end of seventy years, the Lord will deal with Tyre. She will return to her lucrative prostitution and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the Lord; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the Lord, for abundant food and fine clothes.

See, the Lord is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants. It will be the same for priest as for people, for the master as for his servant, for the mistress as for her maid, for seller as for buyer, for borrower as for lender, for debtor as for creditor. The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered. The Lord has spoken this word. The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the heavens languish with the earth. The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left. The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan. The joyful timbrels are stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent. No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers. The ruined city lies desolate; the entrance to every house is barred. In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all joyful sounds are banished from the earth. The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces. So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.The people will raise their voices and sing for the greatness of the Lord, shouting from the sea. So, honor the Lord in the fires, and praise the name of the Lord God of Israel from the islands of the sea. From the farthest parts of the earth, we hear songs of praise for the righteous. But I said, "I am in distress, woe to me! The deceitful have acted deceitfully, and with great treachery." Fear, the pit, and the snare await you, inhabitants of the earth. Whoever flees from the sound of fear will fall into the pit, and whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare. The windows of heaven are open, and the foundations of the earth shake. The earth is utterly broken, completely shattered, and violently shaken. It will stagger like a drunkard and sway like a hut; its rebellion weighs heavily upon it, and it will fall, never to rise again.

On that day, the Lord will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below. They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit and confined in a dungeon; after many days, they will be punished. The moon will be dismayed, and the sun ashamed, for the Lord Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders, gloriously.

O Lord, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans formed of old, faithful and true. You have turned the city into a heap, the fortified city into a ruin; the palace of foreigners is no longer a city and will never be rebuilt. Therefore, strong peoples will honor you; cities of ruthless nations will revere you. You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in their distress, a shelter from the storm, and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall, like heat in a dry land. You subdue the uproar of foreigners; as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled.

On this mountain, the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine—the best of meats and the finest of wines. On this mountain, he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people's disgrace from all the earth. The Lord has spoken.

In that day, they will say, "Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the Lord; we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation." The hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain, but Moab will be trampled in their land as straw is trampled down in the manure. They will spread out their hands in it, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness of their hands. He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust.

In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; God makes salvation its walls and ramparts. Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that keeps faith. You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in you. Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal. He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust. Feet trample it down—the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor."

The path of the righteous is level; you, the Upright One, make the way of the righteous smooth. Yes, Lord, walking in the way of your laws, we wait for you; your name and renown are the desire of our hearts. My soul yearns for you in the night; in the morning, my spirit longs for you. When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness. Though grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness, they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of the Lord. Lord, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.

Lord, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished, you have done for us. Lord our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor. They are now dead, they live no more; their spirits do not rise. You punished them and brought them to ruin; you wiped out all memory of them. You have enlarged the nation, Lord; you have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land. Lord, they came to you in their distress; when you disciplined them, they could barely whisper a prayer. As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, Lord. We were with child, we writhed in labor, but we gave birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth, and the people of the world have not come to life.

But your dead will live, Lord; their bodies will rise—let those who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy—your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead. Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by. See, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will disclose the blood shed on it; the earth will conceal its slain no longer.

In that day, the Lord will punish with his sword—his fierce, great, and powerful sword—Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea. In that day, sing about a fruitful vineyard: "I, the Lord, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it. I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire. Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me."

In days to come, Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit. Has the Lord struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her? By warfare and exile, you contend with her—with his fierce blast, he drives her out as on a day the east wind blows. By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like limestone crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing. The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the wilderness; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare. When its twigs are dry, they are broken off, and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.

In that day, the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, Israel, will be gathered up one by one. And in that day, a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.

Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley—to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine! See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground. That proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trampled underfoot. That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like figs ripe before harvest—as soon as people see them and take them in hand, they swallow them.

In that day, the Lord Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people. He will be a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.Who can God teach knowledge and understanding? It's those who have matured and moved beyond basic teachings. Learning happens step by step, bit by bit. God will speak to this people in a way they don't expect, offering rest and refreshment, but they won't listen. His words become repetitive to them, causing them to stumble and be trapped.

Listen, you mockers who rule in Jerusalem. You think you've made a deal with death and lies to protect yourselves, but God says He has laid a solid foundation in Zion—a precious cornerstone. Those who trust in it won't be in a hurry. Justice and righteousness will prevail, sweeping away lies and falsehoods. Your agreements with death and hell will be annulled, and you'll be overwhelmed by the coming scourge.

The situation will be so dire that you'll be uncomfortable, like trying to sleep on a short bed with a narrow blanket. God will rise up and act in unexpected ways, bringing judgment. Don't mock, or your punishment will be severe. God has decreed destruction for the whole earth.

Pay attention and listen to God's words. Does a farmer plow all day without planting? No, he prepares the ground and sows different seeds in their proper places. God instructs him wisely. Different crops are harvested in different ways, and bread grain is not endlessly threshed. This wisdom comes from the Lord, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working.

Woe to Ariel, the city where David lived. Year after year, you continue your rituals, but God will bring distress and sorrow. He will besiege you, and you'll be brought low, speaking from the ground. Your enemies will be like fine dust, disappearing suddenly. The Lord will visit you with thunder, earthquake, and fire. All nations that fight against Ariel will vanish like a dream.

You are in a stupor, not from wine, but because the Lord has closed your eyes and covered your prophets and seers. The vision is like a sealed book that no one can read. You honor God with your lips, but your hearts are far from Him, and your worship is based on human rules. Therefore, God will do amazing things, and the wisdom of the wise will perish.

Woe to those who try to hide their plans from the Lord, thinking no one sees them. You turn things upside down, like clay questioning the potter. Soon, Lebanon will become a fertile field, and the deaf will hear and the blind will see. The humble will rejoice in the Lord, and the ruthless will vanish.

The Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says Jacob will no longer be ashamed. When he sees his children, the work of God's hands, they will honor His name. Those who were confused will understand, and those who complained will learn.

Woe to the rebellious children who seek advice from others but not from God. They make plans without His spirit, adding sin to sin. They go to Egypt for help without consulting God, trusting in Pharaoh's strength, which will bring them shame. Egypt's help is useless, and their strength is to sit still.

Write this down for the future: These are rebellious, deceitful children who refuse to listen to the Lord's law. They tell seers and prophets to stop seeing and prophesying the truth, preferring pleasant lies. Because they reject God's word and trust in oppression and deceit, their downfall will be sudden and complete, like a shattered pot.

The Lord says, "In returning and rest, you will be saved; in quietness and trust is your strength." But you refused, choosing to flee on swift horses, only to be pursued. A thousand will flee at the threat of one, leaving you isolated. The Lord waits to be gracious and show mercy, for He is a God of justice. Blessed are those who wait for Him.The people of Zion in Jerusalem will no longer cry. God will be gracious and answer their cries. Even though they face hardships, their teachers will no longer be hidden, and they will hear guidance clearly, telling them the right path to take. They will reject their idols and cast them away. God will bless their land with rain, making it fertile and abundant. Streams will flow on every high mountain and hill during times of great distress. The moon will shine as brightly as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter when God heals His people.

God's anger will come from afar, burning like a devouring fire. His breath will be like an overwhelming stream, sifting nations and leading people astray. Despite this, the people will sing with joy, as if celebrating a holy festival. God's voice will be heard, showing His power and anger through fire, storms, and hailstones. The Assyrians will be defeated by God's voice, and every place they pass will be filled with music and battles.

Woe to those who seek help from Egypt, relying on their strength instead of seeking the Lord. The Egyptians are mere humans, not God, and their horses are flesh, not spirit. When God acts, both the helper and the helped will fall together. God will defend Jerusalem like a lion protecting its prey, unafraid of shepherds. He will protect and deliver Jerusalem, urging the people to return to Him and abandon their idols.

The Assyrians will fall by a sword not wielded by a human, and their young men will be defeated. They will flee in fear, and their leaders will be terrified by God's banner. A righteous king will reign, and his princes will rule justly. People will find refuge and relief, and those who see and hear will understand clearly. The foolish will no longer be called noble, and the wicked will be exposed for their evil deeds.

Rise up, complacent women, and listen. You will face trouble for many days because the harvest will fail. Mourn for the fields and vineyards, for the land will be overrun with thorns and briers. The once joyful city will be abandoned until the Spirit is poured out from above, transforming the wilderness into a fertile field. Justice and righteousness will prevail, bringing peace and security. God's people will live in peaceful and secure homes, even when hail destroys the forest and the city is brought low. Blessed are those who sow beside all waters, allowing their livestock to roam freely.

Woe to those who destroy and betray without being destroyed or betrayed themselves. When they stop, they will be destroyed and betrayed. Lord, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be our strength every morning and our salvation in times of trouble. At the sound of Your voice, nations will scatter, and their spoils will be gathered like locusts. The Lord is exalted, filling Zion with justice and righteousness. Wisdom and knowledge will be the stability of our times, and the fear of the Lord will be our treasure.

The brave will cry out, and the messengers of peace will weep bitterly. The highways will be deserted, and treaties will be broken. The land will mourn, and its beauty will wither. The Lord will rise and be exalted, consuming His enemies like fire. The people will be burned like lime, and thorns will be set ablaze. Hear what the Lord has done, and acknowledge His power. The sinners in Zion will be terrified, asking who can dwell with the consuming fire. Those who walk righteously and speak uprightly, rejecting oppression and bribes, will dwell on high, with secure provisions.

You will see the king in his beauty and a land that stretches far. You will no longer see a fierce people with an incomprehensible language. Look upon Zion, the city of our festivals, a peaceful and secure place. The Lord will be our mighty river, protecting us from enemy ships.The Lord is our judge, our lawgiver, and our king; He will save us. Your ropes are slack, and you can't keep the mast steady or spread the sail. Then the plunder will be divided, and even the lame will take part. No one living there will say, "I am sick," and the people will be forgiven for their sins.

Come closer, nations, and listen; let the earth and everything in it hear. The Lord's anger is against all nations, and His wrath is upon their armies. He has completely destroyed them and handed them over to slaughter. Their dead bodies will be left unburied, and the stench will rise; the mountains will be soaked with their blood. The stars of the heavens will dissolve, and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; all the stars will fall like withered leaves from a vine or a fig tree.

The Lord's sword is drenched in blood and fat, filled with the blood of lambs and goats, and the fat of rams' kidneys. The Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in Edom. Wild oxen will fall with them, and the land will be soaked with blood and fat. This is the day of the Lord's vengeance, the year of retribution for Zion's cause. The streams will turn to pitch, the dust to sulfur, and the land will become burning pitch. It will burn continuously, and its smoke will rise forever. It will lie desolate for generations, and no one will pass through it.

Owls and ravens will inhabit it, and the Lord will stretch over it a measuring line of chaos and a plumb line of desolation. Nobles will have nothing to rule, and all the princes will vanish. Thorns will overrun its palaces, and it will become a haunt for jackals and a home for owls. Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will call to each other. Night creatures will settle there and find a place of rest. Owls will nest and lay eggs, hatch them, and care for their young. Vultures will gather, each with its mate.

Look in the book of the Lord and read: None of these will be missing, not one will lack her mate. For the Lord has commanded, and His Spirit will gather them together. He has allotted their portions, and His hand has distributed them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there for generations.

The wilderness and the dry land will be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose. It will burst into bloom and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God. Strengthen the weak hands and steady the feeble knees. Say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come with vengeance, with divine retribution. He will come to save you."

Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. The lame will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert. The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow. A highway will be there, called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way. Wicked fools will not go about on it. No lion will be there, nor any ravenous beast; they will not be found there. Only the redeemed will walk there, and those the Lord has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.

In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. The king of Assyria sent his field commander from Lachish to Jerusalem with a large army to King Hezekiah. He stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field. Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to him.

The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah: 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? You say you have counsel and might for war, but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. But if you say to me, "We are depending on the Lord our God"—isn't He the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar"?

"'Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen? Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the Lord? The Lord Himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'"

Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."

But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?"

Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you! Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, 'The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.' Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, 'The Lord will deliver us.' Have the gods of any nations ever delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand? Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save their lands from me? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"

But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."

Then Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, son of Asaph, the recorder, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what the field commander had said.

When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord. He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz. They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them. It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that He will rebuke him for the words the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, pray for the remnant that still survives."

When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah, Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard—those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"

When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah. Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush, was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word: "Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.'""Don't let the god you trust deceive you by saying that Jerusalem won't fall into the hands of the Assyrian king. You've heard what the Assyrian kings have done to all the lands, completely destroying them. Do you think you'll be saved? Have the gods of the nations my ancestors destroyed—like Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Telassar—rescued them? Where are the kings of Hamath, Arphad, and the cities of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?"

Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, read it, and went to the temple of the Lord. He spread the letter out before the Lord and prayed, "Lord Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made heaven and earth. Listen, Lord, and hear; open your eyes, Lord, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God. It is true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these nations and their lands. They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. Now, Lord our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, Lord, are God."

Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, this is the word the Lord has spoken against him: 'The Virgin Daughter Zion despises and mocks you. Daughter Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee. Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel! By your messengers, you have ridiculed the Lord. And you have said, "With my many chariots, I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its junipers. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests. I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet, I have dried up all the streams of Egypt."

"'Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old, I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone. Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up. But I know where you are and when you come and go and how you rage against me. Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.'

"This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. Once more, a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above. For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.

"Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: 'He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with a shield or build a siege ramp against it. By the way that he came, he will return; he will not enter this city,' declares the Lord. 'I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.'"

Then the angel of the Lord went out and put to death 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies! So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.

One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, succeeded him as king.

In those days, Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, went to him and said, "This is what the Lord says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover." Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, "Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: "Go and tell Hezekiah, 'This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city. This is the Lord's sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised: I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.' So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.

A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery: I said, "In the prime of my life must I go through the gates of death and be robbed of the rest of my years?" I said, "I will not again see the Lord himself in the land of the living; no longer will I look on my fellow man, or be with those who now dwell in this world. Like a shepherd's tent, my house has been pulled down and taken from me. Like a weaver, I have rolled up my life, and he has cut me off from the loom; day and night, you made an end of me. I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion, he broke all my bones; day and night, you made an end of me. I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!"

But what can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul. Lord, by such things people live; and my spirit finds life in them too. You restored me to health and let me live. Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love, you kept me from the pit of destruction; you have put all my sins behind your back. For the grave cannot praise you, death cannot sing your praise; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness. The living, the living—they praise you, as I am doing today; parents tell their children about your faithfulness. The Lord will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the temple of the Lord.

Isaiah had said, "Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover." Hezekiah had asked, "What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the Lord?"

At that time, Marduk-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah letters and a gift because he had heard of his illness and recovery. Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine olive oil—his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.

Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did those men say, and where did they come from?" "From a distant land," Hezekiah replied. "They came to me from Babylon." The prophet asked, "What did they see in your palace?" "They saw everything in my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."

Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the Lord Almighty: The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord. And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."

"The word of the Lord you have spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For he thought, "There will be peace and security in my lifetime."

Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins. A voice of one calling: "In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain. And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken."

A voice says, "Cry out." And I said, "What shall I cry?" "All people are like grass, and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall because the breath of the Lord blows on them. Surely the people are grass.""The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever. Zion, bringer of good news, go up to a high mountain. Jerusalem, herald of good news, lift up your voice with strength; do not be afraid. Tell the cities of Judah, 'Here is your God!' The Lord God will come with power, and His arm will rule for Him. His reward is with Him, and His recompense accompanies Him. He will tend His flock like a shepherd; He will gather the lambs in His arms and carry them close to His heart. He will gently lead those that have young.

Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, or marked off the heavens with the span of His hand? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on a scale and the hills in a balance? Who can fathom the Spirit of the Lord, or instruct the Lord as His counselor? Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten Him, and who taught Him the right way? Who was it that taught Him knowledge or showed Him the path of understanding?

Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are regarded as dust on the scales. He weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. Before Him, all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by Him as worthless and less than nothing.

With whom, then, will you compare God? To what image will you liken Him? As for an idol, a metalworker casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it. A person too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker to set up an idol that will not topple.

Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy and spreads them out like a tent to live in. He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than He blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.

'To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?' says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.

Why do you complain, Jacob? Why do you say, Israel, 'My way is hidden from the Lord; my cause is disregarded by my God'? Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and His understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.

Be silent before me, you islands! Let the nations renew their strength! Let them come forward and speak; let us meet together at the place of judgment. Who has stirred up one from the east, calling him in righteousness to His service? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword, to windblown chaff with his bow. He pursues them and moves on unscathed, by a path his feet have not traveled before. Who has done this and carried it through, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the Lord—with the first of them and with the last—I am He.

The islands have seen it and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward; they help each other and say to their companions, 'Be strong!' The metalworker encourages the goldsmith, and the one who smooths with the hammer spurs on the one who strikes the anvil. One says of the welding, 'It is good.' The other nails down the idol so it will not topple.

But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you descendants of Abraham my friend, I took you from the ends of the earth, from its farthest corners I called you. I said, 'You are my servant'; I have chosen you and have not rejected you. So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish. Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all. For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, 'Do not fear; I will help you.' Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob, little Israel, do not fear, for I myself will help you, declares the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

See, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff. You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up, and a gale will blow them away. But you will rejoice in the Lord and glory in the Holy One of Israel.

The poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the Lord will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. I will make rivers flow on barren heights, and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into springs. I will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. I will set junipers in the wasteland, the fir and the cypress together, so that people may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the Lord has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it.

Present your case, says the Lord. Set forth your arguments, says Jacob's King. Tell us, you idols, what is going to happen. Tell us what the former things were, so that we may consider them and know their final outcome. Or declare to us the things to come, tell us what the future holds, so we may know that you are gods. Do something, whether good or bad, so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear. But you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless; whoever chooses you is detestable.

I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes—one from the rising sun who calls on my name. He treads on rulers as if they were mortar, as if he were a potter treading the clay. Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know, or beforehand, so we could say, 'He was right'? No one told of this, no one foretold it, no one heard any words from you. I was the first to tell Zion, 'Look, here they are!' I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good news. I look, but there is no one—no one among the gods to give counsel, no one to give answer when I ask them. See, they are all false! Their deeds amount to nothing; their images are but wind and confusion.

Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations. He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness, he will bring forth justice; he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching, the islands will put their hope.

This is what God the Lord says—the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: 'I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.

I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols. See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.'

Sing to the Lord a new song, His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them. Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops. Let them give glory to the Lord and proclaim His praise in the islands. The Lord will march out like a champion, like a warrior He will stir up His zeal; with a shout He will raise the battle cry and will triumph over His enemies.

For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant. I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools.""I will lead the blind along unfamiliar paths, turning darkness into light and making rough places smooth. I will not abandon them. Those who trust in idols and say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in shame. Listen, you deaf; look, you blind, and see. Who is as blind as my servant or as deaf as my messenger? You see many things but do not observe; your ears are open, but you do not hear. The Lord is pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law and make it honorable.

But this is a people robbed and plundered, trapped in holes and hidden in prisons. They are prey with no one to rescue them, and no one says, 'Restore them.' Who among you will listen to this? Who will pay attention in the future? Who handed Jacob over to become loot and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the Lord, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow His ways; they did not obey His law. So He poured out on them His burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.

But now, this is what the Lord says—He who created you, Jacob, He who formed you, Israel: 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze. For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your stead. Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give people in exchange for you, nations in exchange for your life. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west. I will say to the north, "Give them up!" and to the south, "Do not hold them back." Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth—everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.'

Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf. All the nations gather together, and the peoples assemble. Which of their gods foretold this and proclaimed to us the former things? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right, so that others may hear and say, 'It is true.' 'You are my witnesses,' declares the Lord, 'and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am He. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me. I, even I, am the Lord, and apart from me there is no savior. I have revealed and saved and proclaimed—I, and not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses,' declares the Lord, 'that I am God. Yes, and from ancient days I am He. No one can deliver out of my hand. When I act, who can reverse it?'

This is what the Lord says—your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: 'For your sake I will send to Babylon and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians, in the ships in which they took pride. I am the Lord, your Holy One, Israel's Creator, your King.' This is what the Lord says—He who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters, who drew out the chariots and horses, the army and reinforcements together, and they lay there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick: 'Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen, the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.

Yet you have not called on me, Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, Israel. You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense. You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses. I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more. Review the past for me, let us argue the matter together; state the case for your innocence. Your first father sinned; your spokesmen rebelled against me. So I disgraced the dignitaries of your temple; I consigned Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.

But now listen, Jacob, my servant, Israel, whom I have chosen. This is what the Lord says—He who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you: Do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants. They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams. Some will say, "I belong to the Lord"; others will call themselves by the name of Jacob; still others will write on their hand, "The Lord's," and will take the name Israel.

This is what the Lord says—Israel's King and Redeemer, the Lord Almighty: I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God. Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I established my ancient people, and what is yet to come—yes, let them foretell what will come. Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.' All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame. Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit nothing? People who do that will be put to shame; such craftsmen are only human beings. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror and shame.

The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint. The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in human form, human form in all its glory, that it may dwell in a shrine. He cut down cedars, or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow. It is used as fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it. Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, "Ah! I am warm; I see the fire." From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, "Save me! You are my god!" They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand. No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, "Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?" Such a person feeds on ashes; a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?"

Remember these things, Jacob, for you, Israel, are my servant. I have made you, you are my servant; Israel, I will not forget you. I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you.' Sing for joy, you heavens, for the Lord has done this; shout aloud, you earth beneath. Burst into song, you mountains, you forests and all your trees, for the Lord has redeemed Jacob, He displays His glory in Israel.

This is what the Lord says—your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the Lord, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself, who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense, who carries out the words of His servants and fulfills the predictions of His messengers, who says of Jerusalem, "It shall be inhabited," of the towns of Judah, "They shall be rebuilt," and of their ruins, "I will restore them," who says to the watery deep, "Be dry, and I will dry up your streams," who says of Cyrus, "He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, 'Let it be rebuilt,' and of the temple, 'Let its foundations be laid.'"This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, His chosen one: "I have taken you by the hand to conquer nations and strip kings of their power. I will open doors before you that no one can shut. I will go ahead of you, leveling mountains and breaking down gates of bronze and iron. I will give you hidden treasures and secret riches so that you will know that I am the Lord, the God of Israel, who calls you by name. For the sake of my servant Jacob and my chosen people Israel, I have called you by name and given you a title of honor, even though you do not know me. I am the Lord, and there is no other; there is no God besides me. I will strengthen you, even though you have not acknowledged me, so that from the rising of the sun to its setting, people may know there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is no other. I form the light and create darkness; I bring prosperity and create disaster; I, the Lord, do all these things.

Let the heavens rain down righteousness; let the earth open wide so that salvation and righteousness may flourish together. I, the Lord, have created it. Woe to those who argue with their Maker, like clay pots arguing with the potter. Does the clay say to the potter, 'What are you making?' or 'Your work has no handles'? Woe to those who say to their father, 'What have you begotten?' or to their mother, 'What have you brought to birth?'

This is what the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker, says: Ask me about the future of my children; command me concerning the work of my hands. I made the earth and created humanity upon it. My own hands stretched out the heavens; I marshaled their starry hosts. I will raise up Cyrus in righteousness; I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward," says the Lord Almighty.

This is what the Lord says: "The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, and those tall Sabeans—they will come over to you and will be yours. They will trudge behind you, coming over in chains. They will bow down before you and plead with you, saying, 'Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.' Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior. All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced; they will go off into disgrace together. But Israel will be saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting.

For this is what the Lord says—He who created the heavens, He is God; He who fashioned and made the earth, He founded it; He did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited—He says: 'I am the Lord, and there is no other. I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness; I have not said to Jacob's descendants, "Seek me in vain." I, the Lord, speak the truth; I declare what is right.

Gather together and come; assemble, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood, who pray to gods that cannot save. Declare what is to be, present it—let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago, who declared it from the distant past? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none but me. Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked: Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear. They will say of me, "In the Lord alone are deliverance and strength." All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame. But all the descendants of Israel will find deliverance in the Lord and will make their boast in him.

Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; their idols are borne by beasts of burden. The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden for the weary. They stoop and bow down together; unable to rescue the burden, they themselves go off into captivity.

Listen to me, you descendants of Jacob, all the remnant of the people of Israel, you whom I have upheld since your birth, and have carried since you were born. Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.

With whom will you compare me or count me equal? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared? Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, and they bow down and worship it. They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they set it up in its place, and there it stands. From that spot it cannot move. Even though someone cries out to it, it cannot answer; it cannot save them from their troubles.

Remember this, keep it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels. Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me. I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say, 'My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.' From the east, I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said, that I will bring about; what I have planned, that I will do. Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, you who are far from righteousness. I am bringing my righteousness near, it is not far away; and my salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion, my splendor to Israel.

Come down and sit in the dust, Virgin Daughter Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, Queen City of the Babylonians. No more will you be called tender or delicate. Take millstones and grind flour; remove your veil. Lift up your skirts, bare your legs, and wade through the streams. Your nakedness will be exposed and your shame uncovered. I will take vengeance; I will spare no one. Our Redeemer—the Lord Almighty is his name—is the Holy One of Israel.

Sit in silence, go into darkness, Queen City of the Babylonians; no more will you be called queen of kingdoms. I was angry with my people and desecrated my inheritance; I gave them into your hand, and you showed them no mercy. Even on the aged you laid a very heavy yoke. You said, 'I am forever—the eternal queen!' But you did not consider these things or reflect on what might happen.

Now then, listen, you lover of pleasure, lounging in your security and saying to yourself, 'I am, and there is none besides me. I will never be a widow or suffer the loss of children.' Both of these will overtake you in a moment, on a single day: loss of children and widowhood. They will come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and all your potent spells. You have trusted in your wickedness and have said, 'No one sees me.' Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you when you say to yourself, 'I am, and there is none besides me.' Disaster will come upon you, and you will not know how to conjure it away. A calamity will fall upon you that you cannot ward off with a ransom; a catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you.

Keep on, then, with your magic spells and with your many sorceries, which you have labored at since childhood. Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause terror. All the counsel you have received has only worn you out! Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming upon you. Surely they are like stubble; the fire will burn them up. They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. These are not coals for warmth; this is not a fire to sit by. That is all they can do for you—these you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood. Each of them goes on in his error; there is not one that can save you.

Listen to this, you descendants of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and come from the line of Judah, you who take oaths in the name of the Lord and invoke the God of Israel—but not in truth or righteousness. You who call yourselves citizens of the holy city and claim to rely on the God of Israel—the Lord Almighty is his name: I foretold the former things long ago, my mouth announced them and I made them known; then suddenly I acted, and they came to pass. For I knew how stubborn you were; your neck muscles were iron, your forehead was bronze. Therefore I told you these things long ago; before they happened I announced them to you so that you could not say, 'My idols did them; my wooden image and metal god ordained them.' You have heard these things; look at them all. Will you not admit them? From now on I will tell you of new things, of hidden things unknown to you. They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today. So you cannot say, 'Yes, I knew of them.' You have neither heard nor understood; from of old your ears have not been open.I knew you would act deceitfully and have been rebellious since birth. For my name's sake, I hold back my anger and refrain from cutting you off. I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. For my own sake, I do this; I will not let my name be defiled or give my glory to another.

Listen to me, Jacob and Israel, whom I have called: I am the first and the last. My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens. When I summon them, they stand together. Gather and listen: who among them has declared these things? The Lord loves him; he will carry out his purpose against Babylon, and his arm will be against the Chaldeans. I, even I, have spoken; I have called him, I have brought him, and he will succeed in his mission.

Come near and listen to this: from the beginning, I have not spoken in secret; from the time it happened, I was there. And now the Sovereign Lord has sent me, endowed with his Spirit. This is what the Lord says—your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go. If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your well-being like the waves of the sea. Your descendants would have been like the sand, your children like its numberless grains; their name would never be blotted out nor destroyed from before me.

Leave Babylon, flee from the Babylonians! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it to the ends of the earth: say, "The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob." They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and water gushed out. "There is no peace," says the Lord, "for the wicked."

Listen to me, you islands; hear this, you distant nations: Before I was born, the Lord called me; from my mother’s womb, he has spoken my name. He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver. He said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor." But I said, "I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing at all. Yet what is due me is in the Lord’s hand, and my reward is with my God."

And now the Lord says—he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the Lord and my God has been my strength—he says: "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth."

This is what the Lord says—the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel—to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers: "Kings will see you and stand up, princes will see and bow down, because of the Lord, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."

This is what the Lord says: "In the time of my favor I will answer you, and in the day of salvation I will help you; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances, to say to the captives, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Be free!' They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill. They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat down on them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water. I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up. See, they will come from afar—some from the north, some from the west, some from the region of Aswan."

Shout for joy, you heavens; rejoice, you earth; burst into song, you mountains! For the Lord comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.

But Zion said, "The Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me."

"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before me. Your children hasten back, and those who laid you waste depart from you. Lift up your eyes and look around; all your children gather and come to you. As surely as I live," declares the Lord, "you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride.

"Though you were ruined and made desolate and your land laid waste, now you will be too small for your people, and those who devoured you will be far away. The children born during your bereavement will yet say in your hearing, 'This place is too small for us; give us more space to live in.' Then you will say in your heart, 'Who bore me these? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these—where have they come from?'"

This is what the Sovereign Lord says: "See, I will beckon to the nations, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their hips. Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the Lord; those who hope in me will not be disappointed."

Can plunder be taken from warriors, or captives be rescued from the fierce?

But this is what the Lord says: "Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save. I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine. Then all mankind will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."

This is what the Lord says: "Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce with which I sent her away? Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Because of your sins you were sold; because of your transgressions your mother was sent away. When I came, why was there no one? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to deliver you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst. I clothe the heavens with darkness and make sackcloth its covering."

The Sovereign Lord has given me a well-instructed tongue, to know the word that sustains the weary. He wakens me morning by morning, wakens my ear to listen like one being instructed. The Sovereign Lord has opened my ears; I have not been rebellious, I have not turned away. I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting. Because the Sovereign Lord helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore, I have set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame. He who vindicates me is near. Who then will bring charges against me? Let us face each other! Who is my accuser? Let him confront me! It is the Sovereign Lord who helps me. Who will condemn me? They will all wear out like a garment; the moths will eat them up.

Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the word of his servant? Let the one who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on their God. But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. This is what you shall receive from my hand: you will lie down in torment.

Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and who seek the Lord: Look to the rock from which you were cut and to the quarry from which you were hewn; look to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth. When I called him, he was only one man, and I blessed him and made him many. The Lord will surely comfort Zion and will look with compassion on all her ruins; he will make her deserts like Eden, her wastelands like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of singing.

Listen to me, my people; hear me, my nation: Instruction will go out from me; my justice will become a light to the nations. My righteousness draws near speedily, my salvation is on the way, and my arm will bring justice to the nations. The islands will look to me and wait in hope for my arm. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, look at the earth beneath; the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment and its inhabitants die like flies. But my salvation will last forever, my righteousness will never fail.

Hear me, you who know what is right, you people who have taken my instruction to heart: Do not fear the reproach of mere mortals or be terrified by their insults. For the moth will eat them up like a garment; the worm will devour them like wool. But my righteousness will last forever, my salvation through all generations.""Wake up, wake up, and put on strength, O arm of the Lord; wake up as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Aren't you the one who cut Rahab and wounded the dragon? Aren't you the one who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, and made a path through the depths of the sea for the redeemed to cross over? Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord will return and come with singing to Zion; everlasting joy will be upon their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and mourning will flee away.

I, even I, am the one who comforts you. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man who will die, or of a son of man who is made like grass? You have forgotten the Lord your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. You live in constant fear every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy. But where is the fury of the oppressor? The captive exile hastens to be freed, so he won't die in the pit or lack bread. But I am the Lord your God, who divided the sea and made its waves roar. The Lord of hosts is His name. I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand, so I may plant the heavens, lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, 'You are my people.'

Wake up, wake up, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of His fury; you have drunk the dregs of the cup of trembling and wrung them out. There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has brought forth; there is no one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has raised. These two things have come upon you—desolation and destruction, famine and sword. Who will comfort you? Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of all the streets like a wild bull in a net. They are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of your God.

Therefore, hear this, you afflicted one, drunk but not with wine. This is what your Lord, the Lord your God, who defends His people, says: 'See, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; you will never drink it again. But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to you, "Bow down, that we may walk over you," and you have laid your body like the ground and as the street for them to walk over.'

Wake up, wake up, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer enter you. Shake off the dust, rise up, and sit down, O Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck, O captive daughter of Zion. For this is what the Lord says: 'You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money.' For this is what the Lord God says: 'My people went down to Egypt to live there; the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. Now, what do I have here?' declares the Lord. 'For my people have been taken away for nothing, and those who rule over them mock,' declares the Lord. 'And my name is continually blasphemed all day long. Therefore, my people will know my name; therefore, in that day they will know that it is I who foretold it. Yes, it is I.'

How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, 'Your God reigns!' Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices; together they shout for joy. When the Lord returns to Zion, they will see it with their own eyes. Burst into songs of joy together, you ruins of Jerusalem, for the Lord has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord will lay bare His holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.

Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing! Come out from it and be pure, you who carry the vessels of the Lord. But you will not leave in haste or go in flight, for the Lord will go before you, the God of Israel will be your rear guard.

See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. Just as there were many who were appalled at him—his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness—so he will sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.

Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up before Him like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him. He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces, He was despised, and we held Him in low esteem.

Surely He took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered Him punished by God, stricken by Him, and afflicted. But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His wounds, we are healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way, and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth; He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He did not open His mouth. By oppression and judgment, He was taken away. Yet who of His generation protested? For He was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people, He was punished. He was assigned a grave with the wicked and with the rich in His death, though He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.

Yet it was the Lord's will to crush Him and cause Him to suffer, and though the Lord makes His life an offering for sin, He will see His offspring and prolong His days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in His hand. After He has suffered, He will see the light of life and be satisfied; by His knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many, and He will bear their iniquities. Therefore, I will give Him a portion among the great, and He will divide the spoils with the strong, because He poured out His life unto death and was numbered with the transgressors. For He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.

Sing, barren woman, you who never bore a child; burst into song, shout for joy, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband,' says the Lord. 'Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back; lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes. For you will spread out to the right and to the left; your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate cities.

Do not be afraid; you will not be put to shame. Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood. For your Maker is your husband—the Lord Almighty is His name—the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; He is called the God of all the earth. The Lord will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit—a wife who married young, only to be rejected,' says your God. 'For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with deep compassion, I will bring you back. In a surge of anger, I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness, I will have compassion on you,' says the Lord your Redeemer.

'To me, this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again. Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,' says the Lord, who has compassion on you.

Afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted, I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise, your foundations with lapis lazuli. I will make your battlements of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones. All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace. In righteousness, you will be established: tyranny will be far from you; you will have nothing to fear. Terror will be far removed; it will not come near you. If anyone does attack you, it will not be my doing; whoever attacks you will surrender to you.

See, it is I who created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work. And it is I who have created the destroyer to wreak havoc; no weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,' declares the Lord.

Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost. Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy?"Why spend money on things that don't satisfy? Listen to me and eat what is good, and let your soul delight in abundance. Pay attention and come to me; listen, so your soul may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, just like the faithful promises I made to David. See, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the nations. You will summon nations you do not know, and nations that do not know you will come running to you because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified you.

Seek the Lord while He may be found; call on Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the Lord, and He will have mercy on them, and to our God, for He will freely pardon. "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the Lord. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. As the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. Instead of the thornbush will grow the juniper, and instead of briers, the myrtle will grow. This will be for the Lord’s renown, for an everlasting sign, that will endure forever."

This is what the Lord says: "Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed. Blessed is the one who does this—the person who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeps their hands from doing any evil." Let no foreigner who is bound to the Lord say, "The Lord will surely exclude me from his people." And let no eunuch complain, "I am only a dry tree." For this is what the Lord says: "To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant—to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever. And foreigners who bind themselves to the Lord to minister to him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his servants, all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant—these I will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations." The Sovereign Lord declares—he who gathers the exiles of Israel: "I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered."

Come, all you beasts of the field, come and devour, all you beasts of the forest! Israel’s watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they lie around and dream, they love to sleep. They are dogs with mighty appetites; they never have enough. They are shepherds who lack understanding; they all turn to their own way, they seek their own gain. "Come," each one cries, "let me get wine! Let us drink our fill of beer! And tomorrow will be like today, or even far better."

The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; the devout are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death. "But you—come here, you children of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes! Who are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars? You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags. The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; indeed, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In view of all this, should I relent? You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices. Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked with lust on their naked bodies. You went to Molek with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away; you descended to the very realm of the dead! You wearied yourself by such going about, but you would not say, ‘It is hopeless.’ You found renewal of your strength, and so you did not faint.

"Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have not been true to me, and have neither remembered me nor taken this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me? I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you. When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain."

And it will be said: "Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people." For this is what the high and exalted One says—he who lives forever, whose name is holy: "I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite. I will not accuse them forever, nor will I always be angry, for then they would faint away because of me—the very people I have created. I was enraged by their sinful greed; I punished them, and hid my face in anger, yet they kept on in their willful ways. I have seen their ways, but I will heal them; I will guide them and restore comfort to Israel’s mourners, creating praise on their lips. Peace, peace, to those far and near," says the Lord. "And I will heal them." But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud. "There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."

Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the descendants of Jacob their sins. For day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them. ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?’ Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all your workers. Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high. Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, only a day for people to humble themselves? Is it only for bowing one’s head like a reed and for lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord?

"Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter—when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.

"If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk, and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday. The Lord will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail. Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.

"If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord’s holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words, then you will find your joy in the Lord, and I will cause you to ride in triumph on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob." For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.Your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with sin. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters wicked things. No one calls for justice or pleads for truth. They rely on empty arguments and speak lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil. They hatch viper eggs and spin spider webs. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched. Their webs cannot be used for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil, and their hands are full of violence. Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark their ways. They do not know the way of peace; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks in them will know peace.

So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows. Like the blind, we grope along the wall, feeling our way like people without eyes. At midday, we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead. We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away. For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities: rebellion and treachery against the Lord, turning our backs on our God, inciting revolt and oppression, uttering lies our hearts have conceived. So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter. Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey.

The Lord looked and was displeased that there was no justice. He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm achieved salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him. He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak. According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due. From the west, people will fear the name of the Lord, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the Lord drives along.

"The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins," declares the Lord. "As for me, this is my covenant with them," says the Lord. "My Spirit, who is on you, will not depart from you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will always be on your lips, on the lips of your children and on the lips of their descendants—from this time on and forever," says the Lord.

"Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you. See, darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples, but the Lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you. Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn. Lift up your eyes and look about you: All assemble and come to you; your sons come from afar, and your daughters are carried on the hip. Then you will look and be radiant, your heart will throb and swell with joy; the wealth on the seas will be brought to you, to you the riches of the nations will come. Herds of camels will cover your land, young camels of Midian and Ephah. And all from Sheba will come, bearing gold and incense and proclaiming the praise of the Lord. All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve you; they will be accepted as offerings on my altar, and I will adorn my glorious temple.

"Who are these that fly along like clouds, like doves to their nests? Surely the islands look to me; in the lead are the ships of Tarshish, bringing your children from afar, with their silver and gold, to the honor of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendor. Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you. Though in anger I struck you, in favor I will show you compassion. Your gates will always stand open, they will never be shut, day or night, so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations—their kings led in triumphal procession. For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish; it will be utterly ruined.

"The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the juniper, the fir and the cypress together, to adorn my sanctuary; and I will glorify the place for my feet. The children of your oppressors will come bowing before you; all who despise you will bow down at your feet and will call you the City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

"Although you have been forsaken and hated, with no one traveling through, I will make you the everlasting pride and the joy of all generations. You will drink the milk of nations and be nursed at royal breasts. Then you will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. Instead of bronze I will bring you gold, and silver in place of iron. Instead of wood I will bring you bronze, and iron in place of stones. I will make peace your governor and well-being your ruler. No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise. The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end. Then all your people will be righteous and they will possess the land forever. They are the shoot I have planted, the work of my hands, for the display of my splendor. The least of you will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I am the Lord; in its time I will do this swiftly."

The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion—to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor. They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations. Strangers will shepherd your flocks; foreigners will work your fields and vineyards. And you will be called priests of the Lord, you will be named ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast.

Instead of your shame you will receive a double portion, and instead of disgrace you will rejoice in your inheritance. And so you will inherit a double portion in your land, and everlasting joy will be yours. "For I, the Lord, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them. Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the Lord has blessed."

I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.

For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem’s sake I will not remain quiet, till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch. The nations will see your vindication, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow. You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord’s hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God. No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for the Lord will take delight in you, and your land will be married. As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you.

I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.The Lord has sworn by His right hand and mighty arm: "I will no longer let your grain be food for your enemies, and foreigners will not drink the wine you have worked for. Instead, those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of My sanctuary. Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations."

The Lord has proclaimed to the ends of the earth: "Say to the Daughter of Zion, 'See, your salvation comes! His reward is with Him, and His recompense accompanies Him.' They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord; and you will be called Sought After, a City No Longer Deserted."

Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength? "It is I, proclaiming victory, mighty to save." Why are your garments red, like those of someone treading the winepress? "I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations, no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and"Those who tremble at my word, listen: Your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said, 'Let the Lord be glorified,' but they will be put to shame. A voice from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the Lord repaying his enemies. Before she was in labor, she gave birth; before her pain came, she delivered a son. Who has heard of such a thing? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children. Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery? says the Lord. Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery? says your God. Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her. For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance. For this is what the Lord says: I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees. As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem. When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the Lord will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes. See, the Lord is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For with fire and with his sword the Lord will execute judgment on all people, and many will be those slain by the Lord. Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst of those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats, and other unclean things—they will meet their end together with the one they follow, declares the Lord. And I, because of what they have planned and done, am about to come and gather the people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see my glory. I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations. And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord—on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels, says the Lord. They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the Lord in ceremonially clean vessels. And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites, says the Lord. As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me, declares the Lord, so will your name and descendants endure. From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me, says the Lord. And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."

The Book of Jeremiah

These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile. The word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations." "Alas, Sovereign Lord," I said, "I do not know how to speak; I am too young." But the Lord said to me, "Do not say, 'I am too young.' You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the Lord. Then the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, "I have put my words in your mouth. See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant." The word of the Lord came to me: "What do you see, Jeremiah?" "I see the branch of an almond tree," I replied. The Lord said to me, "You have seen correctly, for I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled." The word of the Lord came to me again: "What do you see?" "I see a pot that is boiling," I answered. "It is tilting toward us from the north." The Lord said to me, "From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms," declares the Lord. "Their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah. I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made. Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the Lord.

The word of the Lord came to me: "Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: 'This is what the Lord says: "'I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown. Israel was holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,' declares the Lord." Hear the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob, all you clans of Israel. This is what the Lord says: "What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. They did not ask, 'Where is the Lord, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, a land of drought and utter darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?' I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable. The priests did not ask, 'Where is the Lord?' Those who deal with the law did not know me; the leaders rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal, following worthless idols. Therefore I bring charges against you again," declares the Lord. "And I will bring charges against your children's children. Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this: Has a nation ever changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols. Be appalled at this, you heavens, and shudder with great horror," declares the Lord. "My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water. Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder? Lions have roared; they have growled at him. They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted. Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull. Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the Lord your God when he led you in the way? Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile? And why go to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates? Your wickedness will punish you; your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your God and have no awe of me," declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty. "Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, 'I will not serve you!' Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute. I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine? Although you wash yourself with soap and use an abundance of cleansing powder, the stain of your guilt is still before me," declares the Sovereign Lord."Even if you use a lot of soap, your guilt is still obvious to me," says the Lord God. "How can you say, 'I am not defiled; I have not followed Baal'? Look at your behavior in the valley; recognize what you have done. You are like a swift camel running here and there, a wild donkey used to the desert, sniffing the wind in her desire. Who can restrain her when she is in heat? All who seek her will not tire themselves; in her mating season, they will find her. Do not run barefoot or let your throat be thirsty. But you said, 'It is hopeless! I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.'

"As a thief is ashamed when caught, so the house of Israel is ashamed—they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets. They say to wood, 'You are my father,' and to stone, 'You gave me birth.' They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, 'Come and save us!' Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you have as many gods as you have towns, Judah.

"Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me," declares the Lord. "In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion. You people of this generation, consider the word of the Lord: 'Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, "We are free to roam; we will come to you no more"? Does a young woman forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.

"How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways. On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this, you say, 'I am innocent; he is not angry with me.' But I will pass judgment on you because you say, 'I have not sinned.' Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria. You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for the Lord has rejected those you trust; you will not be helped by them.

"If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man, should he return to her again? Would not the land be completely defiled? But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers—would you now return to me?" declares the Lord. "Look up to the barren heights and see. Is there any place where you have not been ravished? By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers, sat like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness. Therefore the showers have been withheld, and no spring rains have fallen. Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute; you refuse to blush with shame. Have you not just called to me: 'My Father, my friend from my youth, will you always be angry? Will your wrath continue forever?' This is how you talk, but you do all the evil you can."

During the reign of King Josiah, the Lord said to me, "Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there. I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me, but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery. Because Israel's immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood. In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense," declares the Lord.

The Lord said to me, "Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah. Go, proclaim this message toward the north: 'Return, faithless Israel,' declares the Lord, 'I will frown on you no longer, for I am faithful,' declares the Lord, 'I will not be angry forever. Only acknowledge your guilt—you have rebelled against the Lord your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,'" declares the Lord. "Return, faithless people," declares the Lord, "for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion. Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding. In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land," declares the Lord, "people will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the Lord.' It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made. At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the Lord. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts. In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance.

"I myself said, 'How gladly would I treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.' I thought you would call me 'Father' and not turn away from following me. But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me," declares the Lord.

A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the Lord their God. "Return, faithless people; I will cure you of backsliding." "Yes, we will come to you, for you are the Lord our God. Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception; surely in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our ancestors' labor—their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters. Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the Lord our God, both we and our ancestors; from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the Lord our God."

"If you, Israel, will return, then return to me," declares the Lord. "If you put your detestable idols out of my sight and no longer go astray, and if in a truthful, just, and righteous way you swear, 'As surely as the Lord lives,' then the nations will invoke blessings by him and in him they will boast."

This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: "Break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, circumcise your hearts, you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire because of the evil you have done—burn with no one to quench it.

"Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say: 'Sound the trumpet throughout the land!' Cry aloud and say: 'Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities!' Raise the signal to go to Zion! Flee for safety without delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, even terrible destruction."The people are foolish and lack understanding; they are skilled at doing evil but clueless about doing good. I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; the heavens had no light. The mountains trembled, and the hills swayed. There was no one to be seen, and all the birds had flown away. The fertile land had become a desert, and all the cities were in ruins because of the Lord's fierce anger. The Lord said, "The whole land will be desolate, but I will not completely destroy it. The earth will mourn, and the skies will be dark because I have spoken and will not change my mind."

The entire city will flee at the sound of horsemen and archers; they will hide in the thickets and climb the rocks. Every city will be abandoned, and no one will live there. When you are devastated, what will you do? Even if you dress in crimson, adorn yourself with gold, and apply makeup, your efforts will be in vain; your lovers will despise you and seek your life. I hear a cry like that of a woman in labor, the anguish of someone giving birth to their first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, spreading her hands, saying, "Woe is me! I am fainting because of murderers."

Run through the streets of Jerusalem, look around and see if you can find anyone who acts justly and seeks the truth; if you do, I will forgive the city. Although they say, "As surely as the Lord lives," they are swearing falsely. Lord, your eyes look for truth; you struck them, but they felt no pain; you crushed them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent. I thought, "These are only the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the Lord, the requirements of their God. So I will go to the leaders and speak to them; surely they know the way of the Lord, the requirements of their God." But they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds.

Therefore, a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear apart anyone who ventures out, for their rebellion is great, and their backslidings are many. "Why should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes. They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for another man's wife. Should I not punish them for this?" declares the Lord. "Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?"

"Go through her vineyards and ravage them, but do not destroy them completely. Strip off her branches, for these people do not belong to the Lord. The people of Israel and Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me," declares the Lord. They have lied about the Lord; they said, "He will do nothing! No harm will come to us; we will never see sword or famine. The prophets are but wind, and the word is not in them; so let what they say be done to them."

Therefore, this is what the Lord God Almighty says: "Because the people have spoken these words, I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes. People of Israel," declares the Lord, "I am bringing a distant nation against you—an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you do not understand. Their quivers are like open graves; all of them are mighty warriors. They will devour your harvests and food, devour your sons and daughters; they will devour your flocks and herds, devour your vines and fig trees. With the sword, they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust."

"Yet even in those days," declares the Lord, "I will not destroy you completely. And when the people ask, 'Why has the Lord our God done all this to us?' you will tell them, 'As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land, so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.'"

"Announce this to the descendants of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah: Hear this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear: Should you not fear me?" declares the Lord. "Should you not tremble in my presence? I made the sand a boundary for the sea, an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. The waves may roll, but they cannot prevail; they may roar, but they cannot cross it. But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts; they have turned aside and gone away. They do not say to themselves, 'Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives autumn and spring rains in season, who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.' Your wrongdoings have kept these away; your sins have deprived you of good.

Among my people are the wicked who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch people. Their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not seek justice. They do not promote the case of the fatherless; they do not defend the just cause of the poor. Should I not punish them for this?" declares the Lord. "Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?"

"A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land: The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end?"

"Flee for safety, people of Benjamin! Flee from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa! Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the north, even terrible destruction. I will destroy the Daughter of Zion, so beautiful and delicate. Shepherds with their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents around her, each tending his own portion."

"Prepare for battle against her! Arise, let us attack at noon! But, alas, the daylight is fading, and the shadows of evening grow long. So arise, let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses!"

This is what the Lord Almighty says: "Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; it is filled with oppression. As a well pours out its water, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction resound in her; her sickness and wounds are ever before me. Take warning, Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you and make your land desolate so no one can live in it."

This is what the Lord Almighty says: "Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine; pass your hand over the branches again, like one gathering grapes."

To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed so they cannot hear. The word of the Lord is offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it. But I am full of the wrath of the Lord, and I cannot hold it in. "Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together; both husband and wife will be caught in it, and the old, those weighed down with years. Their houses will be turned over to others, together with their fields and their wives, when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land," declares the Lord.

"From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit. They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. 'Peace, peace,' they say, when there is no peace. Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when I punish them," says the Lord.

This is what the Lord says: "Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, 'We will not walk in it.' I appointed watchmen over you and said, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But you said, 'We will not listen.' Therefore hear, you nations; you who are witnesses, observe what will happen to them. Hear, you earth: I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law. What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me."

Therefore, this is what the Lord says: "I will put obstacles before this people. Parents and children alike will stumble over them; neighbors and friends will perish."

This is what the Lord says: "Look, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth. They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, Daughter of Zion.""Prepare for war against you, Daughter of Zion. We have heard of their might; our hands are weak, and we are gripped by anguish like a woman in labor. Do not go out into the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy's sword and terror are everywhere. Daughter of my people, put on sackcloth and roll in ashes; mourn as if for an only son, with bitter lamentation, for the destroyer will suddenly come upon us.

I have made you a tester of metals among my people, so you may observe and test their ways. They are all stubborn rebels, spreading slander; they are bronze and iron, all of them corrupt. The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the refining is in vain; the wicked are not removed. They will be called rejected silver because the Lord has rejected them.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: Stand at the gate of the Lord's house and proclaim this message: Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the Lord. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place. Do not trust in deceptive words and say, 'This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord!' If you truly change your ways and your actions and deal justly with each other, if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm, then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors forever and ever.

But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my name, and say, 'We are safe'—safe to do all these detestable things? Has this house, which bears my name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the Lord.

Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. While you were doing all these things, declares the Lord, I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer. Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors. I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow Israelites, the people of Ephraim.

So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to arouse my anger. But am I the one they are provoking? declares the Lord. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame?

Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the crops of your land, and it will burn and not be quenched.

This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves! For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you. But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward. From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets. But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.

When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer. Therefore say to them, 'This is the nation that has not obeyed the Lord its God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips. Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the Lord has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath.

The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the Lord. They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it. They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind. So beware, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room. The carcasses of this people will become food for the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.

At that time, declares the Lord, the bones of the kings and officials of Judah, the bones of the priests and prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves. They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, which they have loved and served and followed and consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. Wherever I banish them, all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life, declares the Lord Almighty.

Say to them, 'This is what the Lord says: When people fall down, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not return? Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return. I have listened attentively, but they do not say what is right. None of them repent of their wickedness, saying, "What have I done?" Each pursues their own course like a horse charging into battle. Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons, and the dove, the swift, and the thrush observe the time of their migration. But my people do not know the requirements of the Lord.

How can you say, "We are wise, for we have the law of the Lord," when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely? The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the Lord, what kind of wisdom do they have? Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit. They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. "Peace, peace," they say, when there is no peace. Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when I punish them, says the Lord.

I will take away their harvest, declares the Lord. There will be no grapes on the vine. There will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither. What I have given them will be taken from them. Why are we sitting here? Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there! For the Lord our God has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink because we have sinned against him. We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror. The snorting of the enemy's horses is heard from Dan; at the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles. They have come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who live there. See, I will send venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you, declares the Lord.

You who are my Comforter in sorrow, my heart is faint within me. Listen to the cry of my people from a land far away: "Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King no longer there?" Why have they aroused my anger with their images, with their worthless foreign idols? The harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we are not saved. Since my people are crushed, I am crushed; I mourn, and horror grips me. Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people? Oh, that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people."Oh, that I had a place in the wilderness to stay, far from my people! They are all unfaithful and treacherous. They use their tongues like bows to shoot lies. They don't stand up for the truth and move from one evil act to another, not knowing me, says the Lord. Be cautious of your neighbors and don't trust your brothers, for they are all deceitful and slanderous. They deceive each other and refuse to speak the truth. They have trained their tongues to lie and tire themselves out with sin. They live in a world of deceit and refuse to know me, says the Lord.

Therefore, the Lord of hosts says, 'I will refine and test them. What else can I do for my people? Their tongues are like deadly arrows, speaking deceitfully. They speak peacefully to their neighbors but plot against them in their hearts. Should I not punish them for this? Should I not avenge myself on such a nation?' I will weep and wail for the mountains and the pastures of the wilderness because they are desolate, with no one passing through. The sounds of cattle are gone, and the birds and animals have fled.

I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a den of dragons, and the cities of Judah desolate without inhabitants. Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has the Lord spoken to, so they can explain why the land is ruined and desolate? The Lord says, 'Because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or followed it. Instead, they followed their stubborn hearts and the Baals, as their ancestors taught them. Therefore, I will feed them with bitter food and give them poisoned water to drink. I will scatter them among nations they and their ancestors have never known, and I will send a sword after them until they are destroyed.'

The Lord of hosts says, 'Consider and call for the mourning women to come quickly and wail for us, so our eyes may overflow with tears. A voice of wailing is heard from Zion: "We are ruined! We are greatly ashamed because we have left the land and our homes have been destroyed." Listen to the word of the Lord, you women, and teach your daughters to wail and your neighbors to lament. Death has climbed through our windows and entered our palaces, cutting off the children and young men from the streets.'

The Lord says, 'The bodies of men will fall like dung on the open field, like sheaves left behind by the reaper, with no one to gather them.' The Lord says, 'Let not the wise boast of their wisdom, nor the strong boast of their strength, nor the rich boast of their riches. But let the one who boasts boast about this: that they understand and know me, that I am the Lord who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight.'

The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh: Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all who live in the desert. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart. Hear the word the Lord speaks to you, house of Israel. The Lord says, 'Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, even though the nations are terrified by them. The customs of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel. They adorn it with silver and gold and fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter. Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, their idols cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good.'

There is no one like you, Lord; you are great, and your name is mighty in power. Who should not fear you, King of the nations? This is your due. Among all the wise leaders of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you. They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols. Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. The work of craftsmen and goldsmiths is dressed in blue and purple, all made by skilled workers. But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath.

Tell them this: 'These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.' But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them. They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the people of his inheritance—the Lord Almighty is his name.

Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege. For this is what the Lord says: 'At this time, I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.' Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, 'This is my sickness, and I must endure it.' My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My children are gone from me and are no more; no one is left to pitch my tent or set up my shelter. The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the Lord; so they do not prosper, and all their flock is scattered. Listen! The report is coming—a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals.

Lord, I know that people's lives are not their own; it is not for them to direct their steps. Discipline me, Lord, but only in due measure—not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing. Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.

This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 'Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. Tell them that this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: "Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant—the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace." I said, "Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey"—the land you possess today.' I answered, 'Amen, Lord.'

The Lord said to me, 'Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: "Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, 'Obey me.' But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep."'

Then the Lord said to me, 'There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. Therefore, this is what the Lord says: "I will bring disaster on them that they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.""Do not pray for these people or plead for them, because I will not listen when they cry out to me in their time of trouble. What is my beloved doing in my house, engaging in such immoral acts? When you do evil, you celebrate. The Lord called you a beautiful green olive tree with good fruit, but now, with a loud noise, he has set it on fire, and its branches are broken. The Lord, who planted you, has decreed disaster upon you because of the evil deeds of the house of Israel and Judah, who have angered me by burning incense to Baal.

The Lord revealed their plans to me, and I understood them. I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter, unaware that they had plotted against me, saying, 'Let us destroy the tree and its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living so that his name will be remembered no more.' But you, Lord Almighty, who judge righteously and test the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to you.

Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the people of Anathoth who seek your life and say, 'Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord, or you will die by our hands': I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. Not a remnant will be left, for I will bring disaster upon the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.

You are righteous, Lord, when I bring my case before you. Yet I would speak with you about your justice: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease? You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips but far from their hearts. Yet you know me, Lord; you see me and test my thoughts about you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered! Set them apart for the day of slaughter! How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered? Because those who live in it are wicked, the animals and birds have perished. Moreover, the people are saying, 'He will not see what happens to us.'

If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in safe country, how will you manage in the thickets by the Jordan? Your relatives, members of your own family—even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, though they speak well of you.

I have forsaken my house, abandoned my inheritance; I have given the one I love into the hands of her enemies. My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She roars at me; therefore, I hate her. My inheritance has become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack. Go and gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour. Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland. It will be made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares. Over all the barren heights in the desert, destroyers will swarm, for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will be safe. They will sow wheat but reap thorns; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing. They will bear the shame of their harvest because of the Lord's fierce anger.

This is what the Lord says: 'As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands, and I will uproot the people of Judah from among them. But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country. And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, "As surely as the Lord lives"—even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal—then they will be established among my people. But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,' declares the Lord.

This is what the Lord said to me: 'Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water.' So I bought a belt, as the Lord directed, and put it around my waist. Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time: 'Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks.' So I went and hid it at Perath, as the Lord told me. Many days later, the Lord said to me, 'Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.' So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless.

Then the word of the Lord came to me: 'This is what the Lord says: In the same way, I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt—completely useless! For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,' declares the Lord, 'to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.'

'Say to them: This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.' And if they say to you, 'Don't we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?' then tell them, 'This is what the Lord says: I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land—including the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all those living in Jerusalem. I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike,' declares the Lord. 'I will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them.'

Hear and pay attention, do not be arrogant, for the Lord has spoken. Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings the darkness, before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it to utter darkness and change it to deep gloom. If you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the Lord's flock will be taken captive.

Say to the king and to the queen mother, 'Come down from your thrones, for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads.' The cities in the Negev will be shut up, and there will be no one to open them. All Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away. Look up and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, the sheep of which you boasted? What will you say when the Lord sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies? Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor? And if you ask yourself, 'Why has this happened to me?'—it is because of your many sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated. Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil. I will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind. This is your lot, the portion I have decreed for you,' declares the Lord, 'because you have forgotten me and trusted in false gods. I will pull up your skirts over your face that your shame may be seen—your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution! I have seen your detestable acts on the hills and in the fields. Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will you be unclean?'

This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought: 'Judah mourns, her cities languish; they wail for the land, and a cry goes up from Jerusalem. The nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns but find no water. They return with their jars unfilled; dismayed and despairing, they cover their heads. The ground is cracked because there is no rain in the land; the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads. Even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass. Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights and pant like jackals; their eyes fail for lack of food.'The Lord says, "These people love to wander and don't restrain themselves, so I won't accept them. I will remember their sins and punish them. Don't pray for their well-being. Even if they fast and offer sacrifices, I won't listen. Instead, I'll destroy them with war, famine, and disease."

I said, "But the prophets tell them they will have peace and not face these disasters."

The Lord replied, "Those prophets are lying. I didn't send them or command them to speak. They are giving false visions and deceitful messages. Because of this, those prophets will be destroyed by war and famine. The people who listen to them will also suffer and die in the streets of Jerusalem, with no one to bury them."

The Lord continued, "Tell the people to weep day and night because they are severely wounded. If I go to the fields, I see people killed by the sword. If I go to the city, I see people sick from famine. Both prophets and priests wander in a land they don't know."

I asked, "Have you completely rejected Judah? Why have you struck us with no hope of healing? We hoped for peace, but only trouble came. We admit our sins and the sins of our ancestors. Please don't reject us for your name's sake. Remember your covenant with us. Can any of the false gods bring rain? Only you, Lord, can do that. We will wait for you because you made all these things."

The Lord said, "Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, I wouldn't help these people. Send them away from my presence. If they ask where to go, tell them: 'Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for famine, to famine; those for captivity, to captivity.' I will appoint four kinds of destroyers: the sword to kill, dogs to drag away, birds to devour, and wild animals to destroy. I will scatter them among all nations because of what Manasseh did in Jerusalem."

"Who will pity you, Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? You have forsaken me and gone backward. I will destroy you because I am tired of relenting. I will scatter you like chaff with a winnowing fork at the city gates. I will bereave and destroy my people because they refuse to change their ways. There will be more widows than the sand of the sea. I will bring a destroyer at noon against the mothers of young men. I will cause anguish and terror to fall suddenly upon the city. The mother of seven will grow weak and die. Her sun will set while it is still day. The survivors will be given to the sword before their enemies."

I lamented, "Woe to me, my mother, that you gave birth to a man of strife and contention. I haven't lent or borrowed, yet everyone curses me."

The Lord said, "I will make your enemies treat you well in times of disaster and distress. Can iron break iron from the north and bronze? I will give away your wealth and treasures as plunder because of your sins. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you don't know, for my anger is kindled against you."

I prayed, "Lord, you know me. Remember and care for me. Avenge me against my persecutors. Don't take me away in your patience. I suffer for your sake. Your words were found, and I ate them. They brought joy and delight to my heart because I bear your name, Lord God Almighty. I didn't sit in the company of revelers or celebrate. I sat alone because your hand was on me, and you filled me with indignation. Why is my pain unending and my wound incurable? Will you be to me like a deceptive brook, like a spring that fails?"

The Lord replied, "If you repent, I will restore you so you can serve me. If you speak worthy words, you will be my spokesman. Let the people turn to you, but you must not turn to them. I will make you a fortified wall of bronze. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue and save you. I will deliver you from the hands of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the cruel."

The Lord also said, "Do not marry or have children in this place. For the children born here and their parents will die gruesome deaths. They will not be mourned or buried but will lie like dung on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their bodies will be food for birds and wild animals."

The Lord continued, "Do not enter a house where there is mourning or show sympathy, for I have withdrawn my peace, love, and mercy from this people. Both great and small will die in this land, unburied and unmourned. Do not enter a house of feasting to sit and eat with them. I will end the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place."

When you tell the people all these words, they will ask, "Why has the Lord decreed such a great disaster against us? What is our sin?"

Tell them, "It is because your ancestors forsook me and followed other gods. You have behaved even worse than your ancestors. Each of you follows the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known. There you will serve other gods day and night, and I will show you no favor."

However, the days are coming when people will no longer say, "As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt," but instead, "As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them." For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.

The Lord says, "I will send for many fishermen to catch them, and after that, I will send for many hunters to hunt them down on every mountain, hill, and crevice. My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed. I will repay them double for their wickedness and sin because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and filled my inheritance with their detestable idols."

Lord, my strength and fortress, my refuge in times of distress, the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say, "Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods, worthless idols that did them no good." Can people make their own gods? Yes, but they are not gods!

The Lord says, "Therefore, I will teach them—this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the Lord."The Lord said, "Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, I wouldn't help these people. Send them away from my presence. If they ask where to go, tell them: 'Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for famine, to famine; those for captivity, to captivity.' I will appoint four kinds of destroyers: the sword to kill, dogs to drag away, birds to devour, and wild animals to destroy. I will scatter them among all nations because of what Manasseh did in Jerusalem."

"Who will pity you, Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? You have forsaken me and gone backward. I will destroy you because I am tired of relenting. I will scatter you like chaff with a winnowing fork at the city gates. I will bereave and destroy my people because they refuse to change their ways. There will be more widows than the sand of the sea. I will bring a destroyer at noon against the mothers of young men. I will cause anguish and terror to fall suddenly upon the city. The mother of seven will grow weak and die. Her sun will set while it is still day. The survivors will be given to the sword before their enemies."

I lamented, "Woe to me, my mother, that you gave birth to a man of strife and contention. I haven't lent or borrowed, yet everyone curses me."

The Lord said, "I will make your enemies treat you well in times of disaster and distress. Can iron break iron from the north and bronze? I will give away your wealth and treasures as plunder because of your sins. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you don't know, for my anger is kindled against you."

They brought joy and delight to my heart because I bear your name, Lord God Almighty. I didn't sit in the company of revelers or celebrate.

When you tell the people all these words, they will ask, "Why has the Lord decreed such a great disaster against us? What is our sin?"

Tell them, "It is because your ancestors forsook me and followed other gods. You have behaved even worse than your ancestors. Each of you follows the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known.

For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.

The Lord says, "I will send for many fishermen to catch them, and after that, I will send for many hunters to hunt them down on every mountain, hill, and crevice. My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed. I will repay them double for their wickedness and sin because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and filled my inheritance with their detestable idols."

Lord, my strength and fortress, my refuge in times of distress, the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say, "Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods, worthless idols that did them no good." Can people make their own gods? Yes, but they are not gods!

The Lord says, "Therefore, I will teach them—this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the Lord."

The sin of Judah is written with an iron pen, engraved with a diamond point on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars. Their children remember their altars and Asherah poles beside the green trees on the high hills. My mountain in the field, I will give your wealth and all your treasures as plunder, and your high places for sin throughout your borders. You will lose the heritage I gave you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled a fire in my anger that will burn forever.

The Lord says, "Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the Lord. They will be like a bush in the wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit."

The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it? I, the Lord, search the heart and examine the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve. Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay are those who gain riches by unjust means. When their lives are half gone, their riches will desert them, and in the end, they will prove to be fools.

A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary. Lord, you are the hope of Israel; all who forsake you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the Lord, the spring of living water.

Heal me, Lord, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise. They keep saying to me, "Where is the word of the Lord? Let it now be fulfilled!" I have not run away from being your shepherd; you know I have not desired the day of despair. What passes my lips is open before you. Do not be a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster. Let my persecutors be put to shame, but keep me from shame; let them be terrified, but keep me from terror. Bring on them the day of disaster; destroy them with double destruction.

This is what the Lord said to me: "Go and stand at the People's Gate, through which the kings of Judah go in and out; stand also at all the other gates of Jerusalem. Say to them, 'Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah and all people of Judah and Jerusalem who come through these gates. This is what the Lord says: Be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem. Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors. Yet they did not listen or pay attention; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond to discipline. But if you are careful to obey me, declares the Lord, and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it, then kings who sit on David's throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials. They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the Lord. But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses.'"

This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: "Go down to the potter's house, and there I will give you my message." So I went down to the potter's house, and I saw him working at the wheel. But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.

Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said, "Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?" declares the Lord. "Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel. If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.

"Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'This is what the Lord says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.' But they will reply, 'It's no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.'"

Therefore this is what the Lord says: "Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel. Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever stop flowing? Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths. They made them walk in byways, on roads not built up. Their land will be an object of horror and lasting scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads. Like a wind from the east, I will scatter them before their enemies; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster."

They said, "Come, let's make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let's attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says."

Listen to me, Lord; hear what my accusers are saying! Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them. So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle. Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet. But you, Lord, know all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger."

This is what the Lord says: "Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you, and say, 'Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle. For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent. They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. So beware, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.

In this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals. I will devastate this city and make it an object of scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds. I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them. Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching, and say to them, 'This is what the Lord Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter's jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.'"Jeremiah returned from Tophet, where the Lord had sent him to deliver a prophecy. He stood in the courtyard of the Lord's temple and addressed all the people, saying, "This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring upon this city and all its towns the disaster I have pronounced against it, because they have been stubborn and refused to listen to my words."

Pashur, the son of Immer and chief officer in the temple, heard Jeremiah's prophecy. He had Jeremiah beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin, near the Lord's temple. The next day, Pashur released Jeremiah from the stocks, and Jeremiah said to him, "The Lord has not named you Pashur, but Magor-Missabib, meaning 'terror on every side.' For this is what the Lord says: I will make you a terror to yourself and all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies while you watch. I will hand over all of Judah to the king of Babylon, who will take them captive to Babylon and kill them with the sword. I will also give all the wealth of this city, its products, valuables, and treasures of the kings of Judah into the hands of their enemies, who will plunder and carry them off to Babylon. And you, Pashur, along with all your household, will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon, where you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies."

Jeremiah lamented, "Lord, you deceived me, and I was deceived. You overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me. Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. So the word of the Lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long. But if I say, 'I will not mention his word or speak anymore in his name,' his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot. I hear many whispering, 'Terror on every side! Report him! Let's report him!' All my friends are waiting for me to slip, saying, 'Perhaps he will be deceived; then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him.' But the Lord is with me like a mighty warrior; so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced; their dishonor will never be forgotten. Lord Almighty, you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause. Sing to the Lord! Give praise to the Lord! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked.

"Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed! Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, who made him very glad, saying, 'A child is born to you—a son!' May that man be like the towns the Lord overthrew without pity. May he hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry at noon. For he did not kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave, her womb enlarged forever. Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?"

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to him. They said, "Inquire now of the Lord for us because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the Lord will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us."

But Jeremiah answered them, "Tell Zedekiah, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city. I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague. After that, declares the Lord, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword, and famine into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.'

"Furthermore, tell the people, 'This is what the Lord says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives. I have determined to bring disaster on this city, not prosperity, declares the Lord. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.'

"Concerning the royal house of Judah, hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says to you, house of David: 'Administer justice every morning; rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed, or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done—burn with no one to quench it. I am against you, Jerusalem, you who live above this valley on the rocky plateau, declares the Lord—you who say, "Who can come against us? Who can enter our refuge?" I will punish you as your deeds deserve, declares the Lord. I will kindle a fire in your forests that will consume everything around you.'"

This is what the Lord says: "Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there: 'Hear the word of the Lord to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David's throne—you, your officials, and your people who come through these gates. This is what the Lord says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David's throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people. But if you do not obey these commands, declares the Lord, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.'"

For this is what the Lord says about the palace of the king of Judah: "Though you are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, I will surely make you like a wasteland, like towns not inhabited. I will send destroyers against you, each man with his weapons, and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire.

"People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, 'Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city?' And the answer will be: 'Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and have worshiped and served other gods.'

"Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again."

For this is what the Lord says about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: "He will never return. He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again."

Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his own people work for nothing, not paying them for their labor. He says, 'I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.' So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar, and decorates it in red.

"Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him. He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me?" declares the Lord. "But your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion."

Therefore, this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: "They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!' They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!' He will have the burial of a donkey—dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem."

"Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out from Abarim, for all your allies are crushed. I warned you when you felt secure, but you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your way from your youth; you have not obeyed me. The wind will drive all your shepherds away, and your allies will go into exile. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness.""Go into captivity, and then you will feel ashamed and humiliated for all your wickedness. People of Lebanon, who live in the cedar forests, how will you feel when pain comes upon you like a woman in labor? As surely as I live, declares the Lord, even if Coniah, son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull him off. I will hand you over to those who seek your life, to those you fear, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and to the Chaldeans. I will throw you and your mother into another country where you were not born, and there you will die. You will never return to the land you long to go back to. Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot, an object no one wants? Why are he and his descendants thrown out and cast into a land they do not know? O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says: Record this man as childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his descendants will succeed in sitting on David's throne or ruling in Judah.

Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture, declares the Lord. Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my flock and driven them away without caring for them. I will punish you for your evil deeds, declares the Lord. I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the countries where I have driven them and bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing, declares the Lord.

The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land. In his days, Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior. So then, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer say, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,' but they will say, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' Then they will live in their own land.

My heart is broken within me because of the prophets; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord and his holy words. The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse, the land lies parched and the pastures in the wilderness are withered. The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly. Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple, I find their wickedness, declares the Lord. Therefore, their path will become slippery; they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall. I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished, declares the Lord.

Among the prophets of Samaria, I saw this repulsive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. And among the prophets of Jerusalem, I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of evildoers so that no one turns from their wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah. Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty says concerning the prophets: I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.

This is what the Lord Almighty says: Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord. They keep saying to those who despise me, 'The Lord says: You will have peace.' And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts, they say, 'No harm will come to you.' But which of them has stood in the council of the Lord to see or hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word? See, the storm of the Lord will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come, you will understand it clearly. I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied. But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds.

Am I only a God nearby, declares the Lord, and not a God far away? Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the Lord. I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!' How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain? declares the Lord. Is not my word like fire, declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?

Therefore, declares the Lord, I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. Yes, declares the Lord, I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, 'The Lord declares.' Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams, declares the Lord. They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least, declares the Lord.

When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, 'What is the message from the Lord?' say to them, 'What message? I will forsake you, declares the Lord.' If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, 'This is a message from the Lord,' I will punish them and their household. This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: 'What is the Lord's answer?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?' But you must not mention 'a message from the Lord' again, because each one's word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the Lord Almighty, our God. This is what you keep saying to a prophet: 'What is the Lord's answer to you?' or 'What has the Lord spoken?' Although you claim, 'This is a message from the Lord,' this is what the Lord says: You used the words, 'This is a message from the Lord,' even though I told you that you must not claim, 'This is a message from the Lord.' Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.

The Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord. One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten. Then the Lord asked me, 'What do you see, Jeremiah?' 'Figs,' I answered. 'The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.'

Then the word of the Lord came to me: 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Like these good figs, I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians. My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them. I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart.

But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten, says the Lord, so will I deal with Zedekiah, king of Judah, his officials, and the survivors from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt. I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a curse and an object of ridicule, wherever I banish them. I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.'"For 23 years, the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened. The Lord has sent all His servants, the prophets, to you, but you have ignored them. They urged you to turn from your evil ways and actions, to live in the land the Lord gave you and your ancestors forever. They told you not to follow other gods or provoke the Lord with your actions, so He would not harm you. Yet, you did not listen, and you provoked Him with your deeds to your own detriment.

Therefore, the Lord says, because you have not listened to His words, He will summon all the families of the north and Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, His servant, to bring them against this land and its inhabitants. They will destroy it and make it a desolation, a subject of scorn and everlasting ruin. The Lord will silence the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones, and the light of lamps. This entire land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.

After seventy years, the Lord will punish the king of Babylon and that nation for their sins and make their land desolate forever. He will bring upon that land all the words He has spoken against it, everything written in this book that Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. Many nations and great kings will enslave them, and the Lord will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.

The Lord, the God of Israel, told me to take the cup of His wrath and make all the nations to whom He sends me drink it. They will drink, stagger, and go mad because of the sword He will send among them. So, I took the cup from the Lord's hand and made all the nations drink it, including Jerusalem, the cities of Judah, their kings and officials, to make them a desolation, an object of horror and scorn, a curse, as they are today. This included Pharaoh, king of Egypt, his officials, his people, and all the mixed people; all the kings of the land of Uz; the kings of the Philistines in Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnants of Ashdod; Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites; the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair; all the kings of Arabia and the mixed people who live in the desert; all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media; all the kings of the north, near and far, one after another; and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. The king of Sheshach will drink after them.

The Lord says to tell them, "Drink, get drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more because of the sword I am sending among you." If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, "The Lord Almighty says you must drink it. I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears My name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth," declares the Lord Almighty.

Prophesy all these words against them and say, "The Lord will roar from on high; He will thunder from His holy dwelling and roar mightily against His land. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, against all who live on the earth. The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth, for the Lord will bring charges against the nations; He will bring judgment on all mankind and put the wicked to the sword," declares the Lord.

The Lord Almighty says, "Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth." At that time, those slain by the Lord will be everywhere—from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. Wail, you shepherds; cry out! Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock, for your time to be slaughtered has come; you will fall like the best of the rams. The shepherds will have nowhere to flee, the leaders of the flock no place to escape. Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the Lord is destroying their pasture. The peaceful meadows will be laid waste because of the fierce anger of the Lord. Like a lion, He will leave His lair, and their land will become desolate because of the sword of the oppressor and because of the Lord's fierce anger.

In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, the word of the Lord came, saying, "Stand in the courtyard of the Lord's house and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who come to worship in the house of the Lord. Tell them everything I command you; do not omit a word. Perhaps they will listen, and each will turn from their evil ways. Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done. Tell them, 'This is what the Lord says: If you do not listen to Me and follow My law, which I have set before you, and if you do not listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened), then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse among all the nations of the earth.'"

The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the Lord. When Jeremiah finished saying everything the Lord had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him and said, "You must die! Why do you prophesy in the Lord's name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?" And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.

When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the Lord and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord's house. Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, "This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!"

Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people, "The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard. Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the Lord your God. Then the Lord will relent and not bring the disaster He has pronounced against you. As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right. But be assured, if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and those who live in it, for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing."

Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God."

Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people, "Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, 'This is what the Lord Almighty says: "Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets."' Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the Lord and seek His favor? And did not the Lord relent, so that He did not bring the disaster He pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!"

Now there was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim. He prophesied the same things against this city and this land as Jeremiah did. When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt. King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt, along with some other men. They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people. Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.In the early days of King Jehoiakim's reign, the Lord spoke to Jeremiah, saying, "Make bonds and yokes and put them on your neck. Send them to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through their messengers who come to Jerusalem to see King Zedekiah of Judah. Tell them, 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I made the earth, its people, and animals with my great power and outstretched arm, and I give it to anyone I please. Now I have handed all these lands over to my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. Even the wild animals will serve him. All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time for his land comes, and then many nations and great kings will subjugate him.

If any nation or kingdom refuses to serve Nebuchadnezzar and does not submit to his yoke, I will punish that nation with the sword, famine, and plague until I destroy it by his hand. Do not listen to your prophets, diviners, dreamers, enchanters, or sorcerers who tell you, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon.' They are prophesying lies to you that will lead to your removal from your land, and you will perish. But the nation that submits to the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will let remain in its own land to till it and live there,' declares the Lord.

I also spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah with the same message: 'Submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and live. Why should you and your people die by the sword, famine, and plague as the Lord has decreed for any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon? Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' for they are prophesying lies to you. I have not sent them,' declares the Lord. 'They are prophesying lies in my name, leading you to your destruction.'

I also spoke to the priests and all the people: 'This is what the Lord says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, 'The articles from the Lord's house will soon be brought back from Babylon,' for they are prophesying lies to you. Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a ruin? If they are truly prophets and have the word of the Lord, let them plead with the Lord Almighty that the articles remaining in the Lord's house and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon. For this is what the Lord Almighty says about the pillars, the bronze sea, the movable stands, and the other articles that are left in this city, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says about the things that are left in the house of the Lord and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem: 'They will be taken to Babylon, and there they will remain until the day I come for them,' declares the Lord. 'Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.'

In the same year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people. He said, 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. Within two years, I will bring back to this place all the articles of the Lord's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed and took to Babylon. I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,' declares the Lord, 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'

Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord. He said, 'Amen! May the Lord do so! May the Lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the Lord's house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the Lord only if his prediction comes true.'

Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it. He said before all the people, 'This is what the Lord says: In the same way, I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.' At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.

After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 'Go and tell Hananiah, "This is what the Lord says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place, you will get a yoke of iron. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals."'

Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, 'Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies. Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die because you have preached rebellion against the Lord.' In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.

This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets, and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. This was after King Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials, and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers, and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem. He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said:

This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 'Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it because if it prospers, you too will prosper.'

Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,' declares the Lord.

This is what the Lord says: 'When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,' declares the Lord, 'and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,' declares the Lord, 'and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.'

You may say, 'The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,' but this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David's throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile—yes, this is what the Lord Almighty says: 'I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them, and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten. I will pursue them with the sword, famine, and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them.Because they didn't listen to my words, says the Lord, which I sent to them through my prophets, rising early and sending them, but you wouldn't hear, says the Lord. Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I sent from Jerusalem to Babylon. This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your eyes. Because of them, all the exiles from Judah in Babylon will use this curse: 'May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire.' They have committed outrageous acts in Israel, committing adultery with their neighbors' wives and speaking lies in my name, which I did not command. I am a witness to this, says the Lord.

Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, this is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, 'The Lord has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the Lord, to put any madman who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons. So why haven't you reprimanded Jeremiah of Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you? He has sent this message to us in Babylon: "This exile will be long; build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat their produce."' Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.

Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: Send this message to all the exiles: This is what the Lord says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie, this is what the Lord says: I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. None of his descendants will see the good I will do for my people, declares the Lord, because he has preached rebellion against the Lord.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you. The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their ancestors to possess. These are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah: This is what the Lord says: We hear a cry of panic, of terror, not of peace. Ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale? How awful that day will be! No other will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.

In that day, declares the Lord Almighty, I will break the yoke off their necks and tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them. Instead, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. So do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel, declares the Lord. I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid. I am with you and will save you, declares the Lord. Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only in due measure; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.

This is what the Lord says: Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing. There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you. All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many. Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins, I have done these things to you. But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who make spoil of you I will despoil. But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds, declares the Lord, because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.

This is what the Lord says: I will restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place. From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained. Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them. Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near, and he will come close to me—for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me? declares the Lord. So you will be my people, and I will be your God.

See, the storm of the Lord will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come, you will understand this. At that time, declares the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people. This is what the Lord says: The people who survive the sword will find favor in the wilderness; I will come to give rest to Israel. The Lord appeared to us in the past, saying: I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness. I will build you up again, and you, Virgin Israel, will be rebuilt. Again you will take up your timbrels and go out to dance with the joyful. Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit. There will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim, 'Come, let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God.'

This is what the Lord says: Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, 'Lord, save your people, the remnant of Israel.' See, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return. They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son.

Hear the word of the Lord, you nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: 'He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.' For the Lord will deliver Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they. They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord—the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more. Then young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow. I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty, declares the Lord.

This is what the Lord says: A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more. This is what the Lord says: Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded, declares the Lord. They will return from the land of the enemy. So there is hope for your descendants, declares the Lord. Your children will return to their own land.Set up markers and guideposts; focus on the path you once traveled. Return, O Israel, to your cities. How long will you wander, O unfaithful daughter? The Lord has created something new on earth: a woman will protect a man. The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: In the land of Judah and its cities, people will once again say, 'The Lord bless you, O home of righteousness, O holy mountain.' Farmers and shepherds will live together in Judah and its cities. I will refresh the weary and satisfy the sorrowful.

After this, I awoke and felt refreshed. The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will plant the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of people and animals. Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, to destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant. In those days, people will no longer say, 'The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.' Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes will have their own teeth set on edge.

The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, a covenant they broke, though I was a husband to them. This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord: I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.

This is what the Lord says: He who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the Lord Almighty is his name: Only if these decrees vanish from my sight, declares the Lord, will Israel ever cease being a nation before me. This is what the Lord says: Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done.

The days are coming, declares the Lord, when the city will be rebuilt for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah. The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah. Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, "Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, 'This is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians but will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes. He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the Lord. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.'"

Jeremiah said, "The word of the Lord came to me: Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, 'Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.' Then, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, 'Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.' I knew that this was the word of the Lord; so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver. I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy—and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.

In their presence, I gave Baruch these instructions: 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time. For this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.'

After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord: 'Ah, Sovereign Lord, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you. You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents' sins into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the Lord Almighty, great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind; you reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve. You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours. You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror. You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey. They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them.

See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine, and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see. And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you, Sovereign Lord, say to me, 'Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed.'"

Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me? Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it. The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods. The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse my anger with what their hands have made, declares the Lord. From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight. The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline. They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it. They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.

You are saying about this city, 'By the sword, famine, and plague it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon'; but this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety."to live safely. They will be my people, and I will be their God. I will give them a unified heart and purpose, so they will respect me forever, for their own good and the good of their children. I will make an everlasting covenant with them, promising never to turn away from doing good for them. I will inspire them to stay close to me, and I will take joy in doing good for them. I will firmly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.

Just as I have brought all this disaster upon them, I will also bring all the good I have promised. Fields will once again be bought in this land that you say is desolate, without people or animals, and given over to the Babylonians. People will buy fields with money, sign and seal deeds, and have them witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the hill country, the western foothills, and the Negev. I will restore their fortunes, declares the Lord.

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guard: 'This is what the Lord, the maker of the earth, says—the Lord who formed it and established it, whose name is the Lord: Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know. This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword: They will be filled with the dead bodies of those I will slay in my anger and wrath. I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness.

Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security. I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity and will rebuild them as they were before. I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me. Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise, and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.

This is what the Lord says: You say about this place, 'It is a desolate waste, without people or animals.' Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the Lord, saying, 'Give thanks to the Lord Almighty, for the Lord is good; his love endures forever.' For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before, says the Lord.

This is what the Lord Almighty says: In this place, desolate and without people or animals—in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks. In the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them, says the Lord.

The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah. In those days and at that time, I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line; he will do what is just and right in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior.

For this is what the Lord says: David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel, nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to present sacrifices.

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: This is what the Lord says: If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time, then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore.

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: Have you not noticed that these people are saying, 'The Lord has rejected the two kingdoms he chose'? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation. This is what the Lord says: If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed laws of heaven and earth, then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in his empire were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns: This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, 'This is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon. Yet hear the Lord’s promise to you, Zedekiah king of Judah: This is what the Lord says concerning you: You will not die by the sword; you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your ancestors, the former kings who preceded you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, 'Alas, master!' I myself make this promise, declares the Lord.'

Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out—Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.

The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.

Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 'Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.' Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.

Therefore, this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim 'freedom' for you, declares the Lord—'freedom' to fall by the sword, plague, and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth. Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces. The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf, I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals. I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you."The Lord says, "I will command them to return to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and burn it down. I will make the cities of Judah desolate and uninhabited."

During the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, the Lord spoke to Jeremiah: "Go to the Rechabite family and bring them to one of the rooms in the house of the Lord. Offer them wine to drink." So, Jeremiah took Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah, and his brothers and sons, the whole Rechabite family, to the house of the Lord. They went into the room of the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was next to the room of the officials, above the room of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, the doorkeeper. Jeremiah set bowls full of wine and cups before the Rechabites and said, "Drink some wine."

But they replied, "We do not drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab, son of Rechab, gave us this command: 'Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine. You must never build houses, sow seed, or plant vineyards. You must always live in tents so that you may live a long time in the land where you are nomads.' We have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab, son of Rechab, commanded us. Neither we nor our wives, sons, or daughters have ever drunk wine or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields, or crops. We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything Jonadab commanded us. But when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, invaded this land, we said, 'Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.' So we have remained in Jerusalem."

Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?' declares the Lord. 'Jonadab, son of Rechab, ordered his descendants not to drink wine, and this command has been kept. To this day, they do not drink wine because they obey their ancestor's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me. Again and again, I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, "Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors." But you have not paid attention or listened to me. The descendants of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have carried out the command their ancestor gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.'

Therefore, this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.'"

Then Jeremiah said to the Rechabites, "This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'You have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.' Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Jonadab, son of Rechab, will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.'"

In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you during the reign of Josiah until now. Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways. Then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin."

So Jeremiah called Baruch, son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the Lord had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the Lord's temple. So you go to the house of the Lord on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. Perhaps they will bring their petition before the Lord, and each will turn from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the Lord are great."

Baruch, son of Neriah, did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do. At the Lord's temple, he read the words of the Lord from the scroll. In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, a time of fasting before the Lord was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. From the room of Gemariah, son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the Lord's temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.

When Micaiah, son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll, he went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah, son of Shemaiah, Elnathan, son of Akbor, Gemariah, son of Shaphan, Zedekiah, son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, all the officials sent Jehudi, son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch, son of Neriah, took the scroll and went to them. They said to him, "Sit down, please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.

When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king." They asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?" "Yes," Baruch replied, "he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll."

Then the officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are." After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe's knife and threw them into the firepot until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah, son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord had hidden them.

After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, burned up. Also, tell Jehoiakim, king of Judah, 'This is what the Lord says: You burned that scroll and said, "Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?" Therefore, this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim, king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.'"

So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch, son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, king of Judah, had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.

Zedekiah, son of Josiah, was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin, son of Jehoiakim. Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.The officials, Shelemiah and Zephaniah, asked Jeremiah to pray to the Lord for them. Jeremiah was free to move among the people because he hadn't been imprisoned yet. When Pharaoh's army from Egypt approached, the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem retreated. Then the Lord spoke to Jeremiah, telling him to inform the king of Judah that Pharaoh's army would return to Egypt and the Chaldeans would come back to attack and burn the city.

Despite the temporary retreat of the Chaldeans, Jeremiah warned the people not to deceive themselves into thinking the danger was over. Even if they defeated the Chaldean army, the remaining soldiers would still destroy the city. When the Chaldeans temporarily left, Jeremiah tried to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin. However, he was arrested at the Benjamin Gate by Irijah, who accused him of defecting to the Chaldeans. Jeremiah denied the accusation, but Irijah didn't believe him and took him to the officials, who were angry and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which had been turned into a prison.

Jeremiah remained in the dungeon for many days until King Zedekiah secretly summoned him. The king asked if there was any word from the Lord, and Jeremiah told him that he would be handed over to the king of Babylon. Jeremiah then questioned why he was imprisoned and pointed out that the prophets who claimed Babylon wouldn't attack were wrong. He pleaded with the king not to send him back to Jonathan's house, fearing he would die there. Zedekiah ordered that Jeremiah be kept in the court of the prison and given a daily piece of bread until the city's food supply ran out.

Later, officials heard Jeremiah's prophecy that those who stayed in the city would die by the sword, famine, or plague, but those who surrendered to the Chaldeans would live. They urged the king to put Jeremiah to death, claiming he was demoralizing the soldiers and the people. Zedekiah allowed them to do as they wished, so they lowered Jeremiah into a muddy cistern where he sank into the mire. Ebedmelech, an Ethiopian eunuch in the king's house, heard about this and pleaded with the king to rescue Jeremiah, fearing he would die of hunger. The king ordered Ebedmelech to take thirty men and lift Jeremiah out of the cistern using old rags and ropes. Jeremiah was then returned to the court of the prison.

King Zedekiah secretly met with Jeremiah again, asking him to reveal the Lord's message without hiding anything. Jeremiah warned that if he spoke, the king might kill him or not listen. Zedekiah swore not to harm him or hand him over to those seeking his life. Jeremiah then told the king that if he surrendered to the Babylonian officials, he and the city would be spared. If he didn't, the city would be burned, and he wouldn't escape. Zedekiah expressed fear of being mocked by the Jews who had already defected to the Chaldeans, but Jeremiah assured him that wouldn't happen if he obeyed the Lord.

Jeremiah warned that if Zedekiah didn't surrender, his wives and children would be captured, and he would be taken by the Babylonian king, causing the city to be burned. Zedekiah instructed Jeremiah to keep their conversation secret to avoid death. If the officials questioned him, Jeremiah was to say he had pleaded with the king not to be sent back to Jonathan's house to die. When the officials did question Jeremiah, he followed the king's instructions, and they stopped interrogating him. Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until Jerusalem was captured.

In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem. In the eleventh year, the city was breached, and Babylonian officials took control. Zedekiah and his men fled but were captured in the plains of Jericho and brought to Nebuchadnezzar, who executed Zedekiah's sons and nobles, blinded Zedekiah, and took him to Babylon. The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the people's houses and broke down Jerusalem's walls. The captain of the guard, Nebuzaradan, took the remaining people into captivity, except for the poor, who were left behind.Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, instructed Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, to take care of Jeremiah and do whatever he asked. Nebuzaradan, along with other Babylonian officials, took Jeremiah out of the prison and handed him over to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, so he could live among the people.

While Jeremiah was still confined in the court of the prison, the Lord spoke to him, telling him to inform Ebedmelech, the Ethiopian, that the city would face disaster, but he would be spared because he trusted in the Lord.

After Nebuzaradan released Jeremiah from Ramah, he told him that the Lord had brought the disaster upon the city because the people had sinned and disobeyed. Nebuzaradan offered Jeremiah the choice to come to Babylon or stay in Judah. Jeremiah chose to stay and went to Gedaliah in Mizpah.

When the captains of the forces in the fields heard that Gedaliah had been appointed governor, they came to him in Mizpah. Gedaliah assured them not to fear serving the Babylonians and to settle in the land, gather produce, and live peacefully.

Jews from various regions returned to Judah and gathered a large harvest. However, Johanan and other captains warned Gedaliah that Ishmael, sent by the king of the Ammonites, planned to kill him. Gedaliah didn't believe them.

In the seventh month, Ishmael and ten men killed Gedaliah and others in Mizpah. Ishmael also captured the remaining people and planned to take them to the Ammonites. Johanan and the captains pursued Ishmael, rescued the captives, and planned to flee to Egypt, fearing Babylonian retribution.

The people, led by Johanan, asked Jeremiah to pray for guidance from the Lord. Jeremiah agreed and promised to relay God's message. After ten days, Jeremiah gathered everyone and conveyed the Lord's instructions."God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your request, says: If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I regret the harm I have done to you. Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the Lord, for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand. I will show you mercy so that he will have mercy on you and let you return to your land.

But if you say, 'We will not stay in this land,' and disobey the voice of the Lord your God, saying, 'No, we will go to Egypt where we will not see war, hear the sound of the trumpet, or be hungry for bread, and there we will live,' then hear the word of the Lord, you remnant of Judah. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: If you are determined to go to Egypt and settle there, then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. All who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine, and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring upon them.

This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Just as my anger and wrath have been poured out on the people of Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse, an object of horror, a curse, and a reproach; you will never see this place again. The Lord has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah: Do not go to Egypt. Be sure of this: I warn you today that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the Lord your God and said, 'Pray to the Lord our God for us; tell us everything he says, and we will do it.' I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the Lord your God in all he sent me to tell you. So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine, and plague in the place where you want to go to settle.

When Jeremiah finished telling the people all the words of the Lord their God—everything the Lord had sent him to tell them—Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, 'You are lying! The Lord our God has not sent you to say, "You must not go to Egypt to settle there." But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians, so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon.' So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the Lord’s command to stay in the land of Judah. Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered. They also led away all the men, women, children, and the king’s daughters whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah. So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the Lord and went as far as Tahpanhes.

In Tahpanhes, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 'Take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes in the sight of the Jews. Then say to them, "This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them. He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword. He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart. There, in the temple of the sun in Egypt, he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt."'

This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt: 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew. Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, "Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!" But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today.

Now this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth. Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors.

Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse, and a reproach. I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine, and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.'

Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, 'We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord! We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings, and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.'

The women added, 'When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?'

Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him, 'Did not the Lord remember and call to mind the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land? When the Lord could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today. Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.'

Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, 'Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah in Egypt. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have done what you said you would do when you promised, "We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven." Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! But hear the word of the Lord, all you Jews living in Egypt: I swear by my great name, says the Lord, that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, "As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives." For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs.

This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place, declares the Lord, so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand. This is what the Lord says: I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who wanted to kill him.'""You and your wives have made vows to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven, and you are determined to fulfill them. Therefore, listen to what the Lord says, all of you from Judah living in Egypt: I have sworn by my great name that no one from Judah in Egypt will ever again invoke my name, saying, 'As surely as the Lord lives.' I am watching over you for harm, not for good. All the men of Judah in Egypt will be destroyed by the sword and famine until they are gone. However, a few will escape and return to Judah. Then everyone will know whose word stands—mine or theirs.

This is the sign that I will punish you here, so you will know that my threats against you will come true. I will hand over Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, to his enemies who seek his life, just as I handed over Zedekiah, king of Judah, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who sought his life.

Jeremiah spoke to Baruch, son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book during the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah. The Lord, the God of Israel, said to Baruch: 'You said, "Woe is me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest." But the Lord says: I will tear down what I have built and uproot what I have planted, the whole land. Do not seek great things for yourself. I will bring disaster on all people, but I will let you escape with your life wherever you go.'

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah concerning the nations, specifically against Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, which was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish by the Euphrates River. Prepare your shields and advance into battle! Harness the horses, mount the horsemen, and take your positions with helmets, polish your spears, and put on armor. Why do I see them terrified, retreating? Their warriors are defeated and flee without looking back, overwhelmed by terror. The swift cannot flee, nor the strong escape; they stumble and fall in the north by the Euphrates River.

Who is this rising like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters? Egypt rises like the Nile, boasting it will cover the earth and destroy cities and their inhabitants. Charge, horses! Drive furiously, chariots! Let the warriors advance—Cushites, Libyans, and Lydians, skilled in shield and bow. This is the day of the Lord Almighty, a day of vengeance against his foes. The sword will devour until it is satisfied, drunk with blood. The Lord Almighty has a sacrifice in the north by the Euphrates River.

Go up to Gilead and get balm, Virgin Daughter Egypt. But you multiply remedies in vain; you will not be healed. The nations have heard of your shame; your cries fill the land. One warrior stumbles over another; both fall together.

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah about Nebuchadnezzar attacking Egypt. Announce it in Egypt, proclaim it in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes: 'Take your positions and prepare, for the sword devours around you.' Why are your warriors swept away? They cannot stand because the Lord has pushed them down. They stumble repeatedly; they say, 'Let's go back to our people, to our homeland, away from the oppressor's sword.' They cry out, 'Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is but a noise; he has missed his opportunity.'

As surely as I live, declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty, one will come who is like Tabor among the mountains, like Carmel by the sea. Pack your belongings for exile, Daughter Egypt, for Memphis will be laid waste, a ruin without inhabitant. Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly from the north is coming. Even her mercenaries are like fattened calves; they too will turn and flee together. They cannot stand because the day of disaster is upon them, the time for their punishment.

The sound of Egypt's defeat is like a serpent hissing as they march against her with axes, like woodcutters. They will chop down her forest, though it is dense, because they are more numerous than locusts. Daughter Egypt will be put to shame, handed over to the people of the north.

The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'I will punish Amon of Thebes, Pharaoh, Egypt, her gods, and her kings, and those who trust in Pharaoh. I will hand them over to those who seek their lives, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past,' declares the Lord.

But do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel. I will surely save you from a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid. Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant, for I am with you,' declares the Lord. 'I will completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, but I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only with justice; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.'

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza. This is what the Lord says: 'See how the waters are rising in the north; they will become an overflowing torrent. They will overflow the land and everything in it, the towns and those who live in them. The people will cry out; all who dwell in the land will wail at the sound of the hooves of galloping steeds, the noise of enemy chariots and the rumble of their wheels. Fathers will not turn to help their children; their hands will hang limp. For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines and to cut off all survivors who could help Tyre and Sidon. The Lord is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor. Gaza will shave her head in mourning; Ashkelon will be silenced. You remnant on the plain, how long will you cut yourselves?

'Alas, sword of the Lord, how long till you rest? Return to your sheath; cease and be still.' But how can it rest when the Lord has commanded it to attack Ashkelon and the coast?'The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, declares: "The disaster for Moab is near, and their suffering is coming quickly. All who know them, mourn for them and say, 'How the mighty have fallen!' You who live in Dibon, come down from your glory and sit in the dust, for the destroyer of Moab is coming to ruin your strongholds. Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer; ask those fleeing and escaping, 'What has happened?' Moab is shattered; cry out and announce it in Arnon that Moab is destroyed. Judgment has come to the plateau, to Holon, Jahazah, Mephaath, Dibon, Nebo, Bethdiblathaim, Kiriathaim, Bethgamul, Bethmeon, Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the cities of Moab, near and far. The strength of Moab is gone, and their power is broken," says the Lord.

"Make Moab drunk, for they have defied the Lord. Moab will wallow in their own vomit and be ridiculed. Was not Israel a joke to you? Was he found among thieves that you spoke of him with glee? Leave the cities, you who live in Moab, and dwell in the rocks. Be like a dove that nests in the cliffs. We have heard of Moab's pride—how great it is! Their arrogance, pride, and haughtiness. I know their wrath," declares the Lord, "but it will not achieve anything; their boasts are empty. Therefore, I will wail for Moab; I will cry out for all of Moab; my heart will mourn for the people of Kir Hareseth. I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah, more than for Jazer. Your branches spread to the sea, reaching as far as Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits and your harvest. Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. The shouting is not joyful.

From Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, their voices are heard, from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah. The waters of Nimrim are dried up. I will end the offerings in the high places of Moab and the burning of incense to their gods," declares the Lord. "My heart mourns for Moab like a flute; it mourns for the people of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone. Every head is shaved, every beard cut off; hands are slashed, and everyone wears sackcloth. There is mourning on every rooftop and in every street of Moab. I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants," declares the Lord. "How shattered they are! How they wail! How Moab has turned their backs in shame! Moab has become a laughingstock and a horror to all around them. The Lord says, 'Look! An eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab. Kerioth will be captured, and the strongholds taken. On that day, the hearts of Moab's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor. Moab will be destroyed as a nation because they defied the Lord. Terror, pit, and snare await you, people of Moab,' declares the Lord. 'Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, and whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. I will bring upon Moab the year of their punishment,' declares the Lord. 'In the shadow of Heshbon, the fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon. It burns the foreheads of Moab and the skulls of the noisy boasters. Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile and your daughters into captivity. Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the days to come,' declares the Lord. Here ends the judgment on Moab."

Concerning the Ammonites, the Lord says: "Does Israel have no sons? Is there no heir? Why then does their king inherit Gad, and his people live in its towns? The days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites; it will become a mound of ruins, and its villages will be set on fire. Then Israel will drive out those who drove her out," says the Lord. "Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed! Cry out, you inhabitants of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; run here and there inside the walls, for Molek will go into exile, together with his priests and officials. Why do you boast of your valleys, boast of your valleys so fruitful? Unfaithful daughter Ammon, you trust in your riches and say, 'Who will attack me?' I will bring terror on you from all those around you," declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty. "Every one of you will be driven away, and no one will gather the fugitives. Yet afterward, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites," declares the Lord.

Concerning Edom, the Lord Almighty says: "Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed? Turn and flee, hide in deep caves, you who live in Dedan, for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time I punish him. If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes? If thieves came during the night, would they not steal only as much as they wanted? But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding places so that he cannot conceal himself. His children, relatives, and neighbors will perish, and he will be no more. Leave your orphans; I will protect their lives. Your widows too can trust in me."

This is what the Lord says: "If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but must drink it. I swear by myself," declares the Lord, "that Bozrah will become a ruin and a curse, an object of horror and reproach; and all its towns will be in ruins forever." I have heard a message from the Lord; an envoy was sent to the nations to say, "Assemble yourselves to attack it! Rise up for battle!" "Now I will make you small among the nations, despised by mankind. The terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks, who occupy the heights of the hill. Though you build your nest as high as the eagle's, from there I will bring you down," declares the Lord. "Edom will become an object of horror; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds. As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown, along with their neighboring towns," says the Lord, "so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it. Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?" Therefore, hear what the Lord has planned against Edom, what he has purposed against those who live in Teman: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate. At the sound of their fall, the earth will tremble; their cry will resound to the Red Sea. Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day, the hearts of Edom's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.

Concerning Damascus: "Hamath and Arpad are dismayed, for they have heard bad news. They are disheartened, troubled like the restless sea. Damascus has become feeble, she has turned to flee, and panic has gripped her; anguish and pain have seized her, pain like that of a woman in labor. Why has the city of praise not been abandoned, the town in which I delight? Surely, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day," declares the Lord Almighty. "I will set fire to the walls of Damascus; it will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad."

Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked, this is what the Lord says: "Arise, and attack Kedar and destroy the people of the East. Their tents and their flocks will be taken; their shelters will be carried off with all their goods and camels. People will shout to them, 'Terror on every side!' Flee quickly away! Stay in deep caves, you who live in Hazor," declares the Lord. "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has plotted against you; he has devised a plan against you. 'Arise and attack a nation at ease, which lives in confidence,' declares the Lord, 'a nation that has neither gates nor bars; its people live far from danger. Their camels will become plunder, and their large herds will be spoils of war. I will scatter to the winds those who are in distant places and bring disaster on them from every side,'" declares the Lord. "Hazor will become a haunt of jackals, a desolate place forever. No one will live there; no people will dwell in it."The Lord's message to Jeremiah about Elam came at the start of King Zedekiah's reign in Judah. The Lord said, "I will break Elam's bow, their main strength. I will bring the four winds from all directions and scatter them everywhere. No nation will be without Elam's exiles. I will terrify Elam before their enemies and those who seek their lives. I will bring disaster upon them, my fierce anger," declares the Lord. "I will pursue them with the sword until they are destroyed. I will set my throne in Elam and eliminate their king and officials," says the Lord. "But in the future, I will restore Elam's fortunes," declares the Lord.

The Lord spoke against Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans through Jeremiah the prophet. "Announce and proclaim among the nations, 'Babylon is captured, Bel is shamed, Marduk is shattered. Her idols are disgraced, her images are broken.' A nation from the north will attack her, making her land desolate, with no one living there. People and animals will flee. In those days," declares the Lord, "the people of Israel and Judah will come together, weeping as they seek the Lord their God. They will ask the way to Zion and say, 'Come, let us join the Lord in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.' My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds led them astray, causing them to wander in the mountains. They forgot their resting place. Whoever found them devoured them, and their enemies said, 'We are not guilty, for they sinned against the Lord, their true pasture, the hope of their ancestors.'

"Flee from Babylon, leave the land of the Chaldeans, and be like the goats leading the flock. I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the north. They will line up against her, and she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors, not returning empty-handed. Chaldea will be plundered; all who plunder her will be satisfied," declares the Lord. "You rejoiced and celebrated, you destroyers of my heritage, because you frolicked like a heifer threshing grain and bellowed like bulls. Your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who bore you will be disgraced. She will be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. Because of the Lord's anger, it will not be inhabited but will be completely desolate. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled and hiss at all her wounds.

"Prepare for battle against Babylon on every side, all you who bend the bow. Shoot at her, spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the Lord. Shout against her on every side. She surrenders, her towers fall, her walls are torn down. This is the Lord's vengeance; take vengeance on her. Do to her as she has done to others. Cut off the sower from Babylon and the reaper with his sickle at harvest time. Because of the oppressor's sword, everyone will return to their own people, everyone will flee to their own land.

"Israel is a scattered flock, driven away by lions. First, the king of Assyria devoured them; now, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken their bones. Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria. I will bring Israel back to their own pasture, and they will graze on Carmel and Bashan, their appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. In those days and at that time,' declares the Lord, 'search will be made for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare.

"Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them," declares the Lord. "Do everything I have commanded you. The noise of battle is in the land, the noise of great destruction. How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! How desolate is Babylon among the nations! I set a trap for you, Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it. You were found and captured because you opposed the Lord. The Lord has opened his armory and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign Lord Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians. Come against her from afar. Break open her storehouses; pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave nothing. Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them! For their day has come, the time for them to be punished. Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the Lord our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for his temple.

"Summon archers against Babylon, all who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day," declares the Lord. "See, I am against you, you arrogant one," declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty, "for your day has come, the time for you to be punished. The arrogant one will stumble and fall, and no one will help her up. I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all who are around her."

This is what the Lord Almighty says: "The people of Israel and Judah are oppressed, all their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go. Yet their Redeemer is strong; the Lord Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land but unrest to those who live in Babylon. A sword against the Babylonians!" declares the Lord, "against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men! A sword against her false prophets; they will become fools. A sword against her warriors; they will be filled with terror. A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks; they will become weaklings. A sword against her treasures; they will be plundered. A drought on her waters; they will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror.

"So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation. As I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns," declares the Lord, "so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it. Look! A people comes from the north; a great nation and many kings are stirred up from the ends of the earth. They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and show no mercy. Their voices roar like the sea as they ride on horses, arrayed like men for battle against you, Daughter Babylon. The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor. Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?" Therefore, hear what the Lord has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate. At the sound of Babylon's capture, the earth will tremble; its cry will resound among the nations.

This is what the Lord says: "I will stir up a destructive wind against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai. I will send foreigners to Babylon to winnow her and devastate her land. They will oppose her on every side in the day of her disaster. Let not the archer string his bow, nor let him put on his armor. Do not spare her young men; completely destroy her army. They will fall down slain in Babylon, fatally wounded in her streets. For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the Lord Almighty, though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel. Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the Lord's vengeance; he will repay her what she deserves. Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord's hand; she made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore, they have now gone mad."Babylon has made the nations drunk with her influence, and now they are mad. Suddenly, Babylon has fallen and is destroyed. Mourn for her and try to heal her, but she cannot be healed. Everyone should return to their own country because her judgment has reached the heavens. The Lord has shown our righteousness; let's declare in Zion the work of our God.

Prepare your weapons and shields because the Lord has stirred the spirit of the kings of the Medes to destroy Babylon as vengeance for His temple. Set up a signal on Babylon's walls, strengthen the watch, and prepare ambushes. The Lord has planned and executed what He spoke against Babylon. You who live by many waters and have abundant treasures, your end has come, and your greed is measured. The Lord of hosts has sworn to fill you with men like locusts, and they will shout against you.

God made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by His understanding. When He speaks, the waters in the heavens roar, and He makes lightning with rain and brings forth the wind. Every person is foolish by their knowledge, and every craftsman is shamed by their idols, which are false and have no breath. These idols are worthless, and in the time of their punishment, they will perish. But the portion of Jacob is not like them; He is the Creator of all things, and Israel is His inheritance. The Lord of hosts is His name.

"You are my battle-ax and weapons of war," says the Lord. "With you, I will shatter nations and destroy kingdoms. I will break in pieces the horse and rider, the chariot and driver, man and woman, old and young, young men and maidens, shepherd and flock, farmer and oxen, and captains and rulers. I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil they have done in Zion," declares the Lord.

"I am against you, O destroying mountain," says the Lord, "which destroys the whole earth. I will stretch out my hand against you, roll you down from the rocks, and make you a burnt mountain. No stone will be taken from you for a cornerstone or foundation; you will be desolate forever," declares the Lord.

Raise a signal in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz, appoint a commander against her, and bring up horses like swarming locusts. Prepare the nations with the kings of the Medes, their captains, and all their rulers. The land will tremble and writhe because the Lord's purposes against Babylon will be fulfilled, making the land desolate without inhabitants.

The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength has failed, and they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire, and her bars are broken. One messenger runs to meet another to inform the king of Babylon that his city is taken from one end. The river crossings are seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers are terrified.

The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says, "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; soon her harvest will come." King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has devoured and crushed me, making me an empty vessel. He has swallowed me like a monster, filled his belly with my delicacies, and cast me out. The violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon, says the inhabitant of Zion, and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, says Jerusalem.

Therefore, the Lord says, "I will defend your cause and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry. Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a haunt for jackals, an object of horror and scorn, without inhabitants. They will roar together like young lions and growl like lion cubs. While they are inflamed, I will prepare a feast for them and make them drunk so that they may rejoice and then sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake," declares the Lord. "I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats."

How Sheshach is captured, the praise of the whole earth seized! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations! The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered with its roaring waves. Her cities have become desolate, a dry land, a desert where no one lives or passes through. I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him, and the wall of Babylon will fall.

"My people, come out of her! Save yourselves from the fierce anger of the Lord. Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and ruler against ruler. The days are coming when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced, and all her slain will fall within her. Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her," declares the Lord.

"Babylon must fall because of Israel's slain, just as the slain in all the earth have fallen because of Babylon. You who have escaped the sword, leave and do not linger! Remember the Lord in a distant land, and think on Jerusalem." We are disgraced because we have been insulted; shame covers our faces because foreigners have entered the holy places of the Lord's house.

"The days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land, the wounded will groan. Even if Babylon ascends to the heavens and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her," declares the Lord. "The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans. The Lord will destroy Babylon; He will silence her loud voice. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound. A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the Lord is a God of retribution; He will repay in full. I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers, and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake," declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty.

This is what the Lord Almighty says: "Babylon's thick wall will be leveled, and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations' labor is only fuel for the flames."

This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon—all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. He said to Seraiah, "When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. Then say, 'Lord, you have said you will destroy this place so that neither people nor animals will live in it; it will be desolate forever.' When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. Then say, 'So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.'"

The words of Jeremiah end here.

Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done. It was because of the Lord's anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end, he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.In the ninth year of King Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his entire army laid siege to Jerusalem. The siege lasted until the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign. By the fourth month, on the ninth day, the famine in the city was so severe that there was no food for the people. The city walls were breached, and the soldiers fled by night through a gate between two walls near the king's garden, even though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. They escaped towards the plain, but the Chaldean army pursued and captured King Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. His troops scattered, and he was taken to King Nebuchadnezzar in Riblah, where he was judged. Nebuchadnezzar killed Zedekiah's sons before his eyes, then blinded Zedekiah, bound him in chains, and took him to Babylon, where he remained in prison until his death.

In the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, on the tenth day of the fifth month, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, entered Jerusalem. He burned down the temple of the Lord, the royal palace, and all the significant houses in Jerusalem. The Chaldean army, under his command, tore down the city walls. Nebuzaradan took many people captive, including the poor who remained in the city and those who had defected to the Babylonians. However, he left some of the poorest people to tend the vineyards and fields.

The Chaldeans broke apart the bronze pillars, the bronze sea, and the bronze bases in the temple and took the bronze to Babylon. They also took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, bowls, and all the bronze articles used in temple service. The captain of the guard took away the basins, firepans, bowls, pots, lampstands, spoons, and cups—everything made of gold and silver. The bronze from the two pillars, the sea, and the twelve bronze bulls under the bases, which King Solomon had made for the temple, was too heavy to measure. Each pillar was about 27 feet high and 18 feet in circumference, hollow with walls three inches thick. The bronze capital on top of one pillar was about 7.5 feet high and decorated with a network and pomegranates, all made of bronze. The second pillar and its decorations were similar.

Nebuzaradan also took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. He took a eunuch in charge of the soldiers, seven men who were close to the king, the army's chief scribe, and sixty other men found in the city. Nebuzaradan brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they were executed. Thus, Judah was taken into exile from its land.

Nebuchadnezzar took 3,023 Jews captive in his seventh year, 832 people from Jerusalem in his eighteenth year, and 745 people in his twenty-third year, totaling 4,600 people.

In the thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's captivity, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Evil-Merodach, the new king of Babylon, released Jehoiachin from prison. He spoke kindly to him, gave him a seat of honor above other kings in Babylon, and provided him with a daily allowance for the rest of his life.

The Lamentations of Jeremiah begin with a sorrowful description of Jerusalem, once full of people and now desolate. The city, once great among nations, is now like a widow. She weeps at night with no one to comfort her, betrayed by her friends who have become enemies. Judah has gone into exile, suffering greatly, with no rest among the nations. Her enemies have overtaken her, and her roads mourn because no one comes to her festivals. Her gates are desolate, her priests groan, her young women grieve, and she is in bitter anguish. Her foes have become her masters, and her enemies prosper because the Lord has afflicted her for her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, and all her splendor has departed. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture, weak and fleeing before the pursuer.

Jerusalem remembers her days of misery and wandering, all the treasures she had in days of old. Her people fell into enemy hands with no one to help. Her enemies saw her and mocked her downfall. Jerusalem has sinned greatly, so she has become unclean. All who honored her now despise her, for they have seen her nakedness. She groans and turns away. Her filthiness clings to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding, with no one to comfort her. "Look, Lord, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."

The enemy has laid hands on all her treasures. She has seen the nations enter her sanctuary—those you forbade to enter your assembly. All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, Lord, and consider, for I am despised."

"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the Lord brought on me in the day of his fierce anger? From on high, he sent fire; it went deep into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long. My sins have been bound into a yoke; his hands have woven them together. They have come upon my neck, and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has given me into the hands of those I cannot withstand. The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men. In his winepress, the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah."

"This is why I weep, and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed." Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The Lord has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.

"The Lord is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look on my suffering. My young men and young women have gone into exile. I called to my allies, but they betrayed me. My priests and elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive. See, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart, I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death. People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me. Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many, and my heart is faint."

In his anger, the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with a cloud. He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth and has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. The Lord has swallowed up without pity all the dwellings of Jacob. In his wrath, he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.The Lord has acted like an enemy, destroying Israel's palaces and strongholds, causing mourning and lamentation in Judah. He has violently removed His temple, forgotten the sacred feasts, and despised the king and priest in His anger. The Lord has abandoned His altar and sanctuary, handing over the city's walls to the enemy, who now celebrate in the house of the Lord as if it were a festival day. The Lord has decided to destroy the wall of Zion, causing the rampart and wall to mourn together. Her gates have sunk into the ground, her bars are broken, and her king and princes are exiled among the Gentiles. The law is no more, and her prophets receive no visions from the Lord. The elders of Zion sit in silence on the ground, covered in dust and sackcloth, while the young women bow their heads in sorrow.

My eyes are filled with tears, my insides churn, and my heart is poured out on the ground because of the destruction of my people. Children and infants faint in the streets, asking their mothers for food and drink as they collapse like the wounded. What can I compare you to, Jerusalem? Your wound is as deep as the sea; who can heal you? Your prophets have given you false and foolish visions, failing to expose your sins and prevent your exile. Instead, they have given you false hopes and reasons for banishment. All who pass by mock and shake their heads at you, Jerusalem, once called the perfection of beauty and the joy of the whole earth. Your enemies gloat and rejoice, saying they have swallowed you up and this is the day they awaited.

The Lord has done what He planned, fulfilling His word from long ago. He has thrown you down without pity, allowing your enemies to rejoice and strengthen their power over you. The hearts of your people cry out to the Lord, "O wall of Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night. Give yourself no rest; let your eyes never cease." Arise and cry out in the night, pour out your heart like water before the Lord, lift your hands to Him for the lives of your children who faint from hunger at every street corner.

Look, Lord, and consider whom you have afflicted. Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord? Young and old lie dead in the streets; my young men and women have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in your anger, without pity. You summoned terrors against me as if on a feast day, and in the day of the Lord's anger, no one escaped or survived. Those I cared for and raised, my enemy has destroyed.

I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God's wrath. He has driven me into darkness, not light. He has turned His hand against me repeatedly all day long. He has made my skin and flesh old and broken my bones. He has besieged me with bitterness and hardship, confining me in darkness like the dead of long ago. He has walled me in so I cannot escape and weighed me down with heavy chains. Even when I cry out for help, He shuts out my prayer. He has blocked my ways with stone and made my paths crooked. He is like a bear lying in wait, a lion in hiding. He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces, leaving me desolate. He has bent His bow and set me as a target for His arrows. He has pierced my heart with His arrows. I have become a laughingstock to all my people, mocked all day long. He has filled me with bitterness and made me drunk with wormwood. He has broken my teeth with gravel and covered me with ashes. My soul is far from peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is. So I say, "My strength and my hope from the Lord have perished."

Remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall. My soul continually remembers them and is bowed down within me. Yet this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: Because of the Lord's great love, we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. I say to myself, "The Lord is my portion; therefore, I will wait for Him." The Lord is good to those who hope in Him, to the one who seeks Him. It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young. Let him sit alone in silence, for the Lord has laid it on him. Let him bury his face in the dust—there may yet be hope. Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him and be filled with disgrace. For the Lord will not cast off forever. Though He brings grief, He will show compassion, so great is His unfailing love. For He does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.

To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land, to deny people their rights before the Most High, to deprive them of justice—would not the Lord see such things? Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it? Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come? Why should the living complain when punished for their sins? Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the Lord. Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven and say, "We have sinned and rebelled, and You have not forgiven. You have covered Yourself with anger and pursued us; You have slain without pity. You have covered Yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through. You have made us scum and refuse among the nations. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction." Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed. My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief, until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees. What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.

Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird. They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me. The waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to perish. I called on Your name, Lord, from the depths of the pit. You heard my plea: "Do not close Your ears to my cry for relief." You came near when I called You, and You said, "Do not fear." Lord, You took up my case; You redeemed my life. Lord, You have seen the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause! You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me. Lord, You have heard their insults, all their plots against me—what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long. Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs. Pay them back what they deserve, Lord, for what their hands have done. Put a veil over their hearts, and may Your curse be on them! Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord.

How the gold has lost its luster, the fine gold become dull! The sacred gems are scattered at every street corner. How the precious children of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter's hands! Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert. The infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them. Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those brought up in royal purple now lie on ash heaps. The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.Their faces are darker than coal; they are unrecognizable in the streets. Their skin clings to their bones, dried up like wood. Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of hunger, wasting away for lack of food. Compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food during the destruction of my people. The Lord has unleashed His fury, pouring out His fierce anger and setting Zion ablaze, consuming its foundations. No one believed that enemies could enter Jerusalem's gates, but it happened because of the sins of the prophets and the iniquities of the priests, who shed the blood of the righteous. They wandered blindly through the streets, defiled by blood, so no one could touch their garments. People shouted at them to leave, calling them unclean. They fled and wandered among the nations, where they could no longer stay. The Lord's anger has scattered them; He no longer watches over them. They showed no respect for the priests or elders. We looked for help in vain, watching for a nation that could not save us. Our enemies hunted us so we couldn't walk in our streets. Our end was near; our days were numbered. Our pursuers were faster than eagles, chasing us in the mountains and ambushing us in the wilderness. The Lord's anointed, our very breath, was captured in their traps. We had thought we could live under His protection among the nations.

Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, living in the land of Uz. But the cup of the Lord's wrath will also come to you; you will be drunk and stripped naked. Your punishment, daughter of Zion, is complete; He will not exile you again. But He will punish your sin, daughter of Edom, and expose your wickedness.

Remember, Lord, what has happened to us; look and see our disgrace. Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners. We have become orphans and fatherless; our mothers are widows. We must pay for the water we drink; our wood is sold to us. We are pursued; we labor without rest. We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread. Our ancestors sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment. Servants rule over us, and no one rescues us from their hands. We risk our lives to get bread because of the sword in the wilderness. Our skin is hot as an oven from the fever of famine. Women in Zion and virgins in Judah have been violated. Princes are hung by their hands; elders are shown no respect. Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood. The elders have left the city gate; the young men have stopped their music. Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning. The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! Because of this, our hearts are faint; our eyes grow dim. Mount Zion lies desolate, overrun by foxes.

But You, Lord, reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to generation. Why do You forget us forever and forsake us for so long? Restore us to Yourself, Lord, that we may return; renew our days as of old, unless You have utterly rejected us and are angry beyond measure.

In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens opened, and I saw visions of God. On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile—the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. There the hand of the Lord was on him. I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance, their form was human, but each of them had four faces and four wings. Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides, they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side, each had the face of a lion, and on the left, the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side, and each had two other wings covering its body. Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.

As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. Under the vault, their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up, he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down, he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.

He said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet, and I will speak to you." As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. He said: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says.' And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them. And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you." Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe."Then he spread the scroll before me, and it was covered with writings of lamentation, mourning, and woe on both sides. He said to me, 'Son of man, eat what you find here; eat this scroll, and then go speak to the people of Israel.' So I opened my mouth, and he made me eat the scroll. He said, 'Son of man, fill your stomach with this scroll I am giving you.' So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.

He then said, 'Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them. You are not being sent to a people with strange and difficult language, but to the people of Israel. Not to many peoples with strange and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate. But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.'

He continued, 'Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, "This is what the Sovereign Lord says," whether they listen or fail to listen.'

Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound—'May the glory of the Lord be praised in his dwelling place!'—the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the Lord on me. I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.

At the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me: 'Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. When I say to a wicked person, "You will surely die," and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.

Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.'

The hand of the Lord was on me there, and he said to me, 'Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.' So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown. Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said, 'Go, shut yourself inside your house. And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people. But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, "This is what the Sovereign Lord says." Whoever will listen, let them listen; and whoever will refuse, let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.

Now, son of man, take a clay tablet, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it. Then lay siege to it: build siege works against it, erect ramps against it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it. Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel.

Lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side. I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel. After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year. Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her. I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.

Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side. Weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day and eat it at set times. Also measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at set times. Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.' The Lord said, 'In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.'

Then I said, 'Not so, Sovereign Lord! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth.'

'Very well,' he said, 'I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement.'

He then said to me, 'Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair, for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of their sin.

Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair. When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword. But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment. Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to all Israel.

This is what the Sovereign Lord says: This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with countries all around her. Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees.

Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: You have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws. You have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you.

Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations. Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again. Therefore in your midst parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds. Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices, I myself will withdraw my favor; I will not look on you with pity or spare you. A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword.

Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I the Lord have spoken in my zeal.

I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by. You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the Lord have spoken.""I will send famine and wild animals to destroy you. Disease and bloodshed will sweep through your land, and I will bring the sword against you. I, the LORD, have spoken.

The word of the LORD came to me: 'Son of man, face the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. Tell them, "Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. I will bring a sword against you and destroy your high places. Your altars will be ruined, and your idols will be shattered. I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols and scatter their bones around your altars. Wherever you live, your towns will be laid waste, and your high places will be demolished. Your altars will be destroyed, your idols will be broken, and your works will be abolished. The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.

But I will spare some of you. When you are scattered among the nations, those who escape will remember me. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices. They will know that I am the LORD and that I did not threaten in vain to bring this disaster upon them.

This is what the Lord GOD says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and cry out, "Alas!" because of all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel. They will fall by the sword, famine, and plague. Those far away will die of the plague, those near will fall by the sword, and those who survive and are besieged will die of famine. Then you will know that I am the LORD.

The slain will lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak—the places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols. I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'

The word of the LORD came to me: 'Son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel: The end has come upon the four corners of the land. The end is now upon you, and I will unleash my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices. I will not look on you with pity or spare you; I will repay you for your conduct and for the detestable practices among you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.

This is what the Lord GOD says: Disaster! Unheard-of disaster! See, it comes! The end has come! The end has come! It has roused itself against you. See, it comes! Doom has come upon you, you who dwell in the land. The time has come, the day is near. There is panic, not joy, on the mountains. I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices. I will not look on you with pity or spare you; I will repay you according to your conduct and the detestable practices among you. Then you will know that it is I the LORD who strikes you.

The day is here! It has come! Doom has burst forth, the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed! Violence has arisen, a rod to punish the wicked. None of the people will be left, none of that crowd—none of their wealth, nothing of value. The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller grieve, for my wrath is on the whole crowd. The seller will not recover the property that was sold—as long as both buyer and seller live. For the vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed. Because of their sins, not one of them will preserve their life.

They have blown the trumpet, they have made all things ready, but no one will go into battle, for my wrath is on the whole crowd. Outside is the sword; inside are plague and famine. Those in the country will die by the sword; those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague. The fugitives who escape will flee to the mountains. Like doves of the valleys, they will all moan, each for their own sins. Every hand will go limp; every leg will be wet with urine. They will put on sackcloth and be clothed with terror. Every face will be covered with shame, and every head will be shaved.

They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be treated as a thing unclean. Their silver and gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD’s wrath. It will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs, for it has caused them to stumble into sin. They took pride in their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their detestable idols. They made it into vile images; therefore, I will make it a thing unclean for them. I will give their wealth as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth, who will defile it. I will turn my face away from the people, and robbers will desecrate the place I treasure. They will enter it and will defile it.

Prepare chains! For the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of violence. I will bring the most wicked of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated. When terror comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none. Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will go searching for a vision from the prophet, but the law will be lost to the priest and counsel to the elders. The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and by their own standards I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'

In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign LORD came on me there. I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be his waist down, he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal. He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood. And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.

Then he said to me, 'Son of man, look toward the north.' So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy. And he said to me, 'Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.'

Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall. He said to me, 'Son of man, now dig into the wall.' So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there. And he said to me, 'Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.' So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.

He said to me, 'Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, "The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land." Again, you will see them doing things that are even more detestable.'

Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz. He said to me, 'Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.'

He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. They were facing east, bowing down to the sun in the east."They faced east and worshipped the sun. Then God asked me, "Do you see this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to commit these abominations? They have filled the land with violence and provoked me to anger. They even put a branch to their nose. Therefore, I will act in fury. I will not spare them or show pity. Even if they cry out loudly, I will not listen."

Then I heard a loud voice calling out, "Bring those who are in charge of the city, each with a weapon in hand." Six men came from the north gate, each carrying a weapon. One man among them was dressed in linen and had a writing kit at his side. They stood by the bronze altar. The glory of God moved from the cherub to the threshold of the house. God called to the man in linen with the writing kit and said, "Go through the city of Jerusalem and mark the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over the detestable things done in it."

To the others, He said, "Follow him through the city and strike down the people. Show no pity or mercy. Kill the old and young, women and children, but do not touch anyone with the mark. Start at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders in front of the temple. He said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go out and kill in the city." As they were killing, I fell facedown and cried out, "Lord God, will you destroy the entire remnant of Israel in your anger against Jerusalem?"

He replied, "The sin of Israel and Judah is very great. The land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of injustice. They say, 'The Lord has forsaken the land; the Lord does not see.' So I will not spare them or show pity. I will bring their conduct down on their own heads." Then the man in linen with the writing kit reported back, "I have done as you commanded."

Next, I saw a vision of a sapphire-like throne above the cherubim. God spoke to the man in linen, "Go between the wheels beneath the cherubim, fill your hands with burning coals, and scatter them over the city." As he did this, the inner court was filled with a cloud, and the brightness of God's glory filled the temple. The sound of the cherubim's wings was like the voice of Almighty God. The man in linen took fire from between the cherubim and scattered it over the city.

The cherubim had four faces: a cherub, a human, a lion, and an eagle. They moved in unison with the wheels beside them, which were full of eyes. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. The glory of the Lord departed from the threshold of the temple and stood above the cherubim. The cherubim lifted their wings and rose from the earth, with the wheels beside them, and stood at the east gate of the Lord's house. The glory of God was above them.

The spirit lifted me and brought me to the east gate of the Lord's house, where I saw twenty-five men, including Jaazaniah and Pelatiah, leaders of the people. God said, "These men are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in the city. They say, 'The time is not near to build houses; this city is the pot, and we are the meat.' Therefore, prophesy against them."

The Spirit of the Lord came upon me and said, "Speak, 'This is what the Lord says: I know what you are thinking. You have killed many in this city and filled its streets with the dead. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: The bodies you have laid in the city are the meat, and the city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it. You fear the sword, and I will bring the sword against you. I will deliver you into the hands of foreigners and execute judgments against you. You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord. This city will not be your pot, nor will you be the meat in it. I will judge you at the border of Israel. You have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.'"

While I was prophesying, Pelatiah died. I fell facedown and cried out, "Lord God, will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?"

Then the word of the Lord came to me, "Son of man, your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the whole house of Israel are those to whom the people of Jerusalem have said, 'Stay far from the Lord; this land has been given to us as our possession.' Therefore, say, 'This is what the Lord God says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, I will be a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.' Therefore, say, 'This is what the Lord God says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel.' They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them. I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God. But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Lord God."

Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, lifted their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it. The Spirit lifted me and brought me back to the exiles in Babylonia in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me, and I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me.The word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Son of man, you live among a rebellious people. They have eyes but do not see, and ears but do not hear, for they are rebellious. Therefore, pack your belongings as if for exile and leave during the day so they can see you. Perhaps they will understand, even though they are rebellious. Bring out your belongings during the day as if for exile, and leave in the evening while they watch, as if going into captivity. Dig through the wall in their sight and carry your belongings out. Do this in their sight, carrying your load on your shoulder at twilight, and cover your face so you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel."

I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as if for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at twilight, carrying them on my shoulder while they watched. In the morning, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Son of man, has not the rebellious house of Israel asked you, 'What are you doing?' Say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: This prophecy concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are there.' Say, 'I am a sign to you. As I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity. The prince among them will carry his belongings on his shoulder at twilight and leave. They will dig through the wall to carry their belongings out. He will cover his face so he cannot see the land with his eyes. I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and he will die there. I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his helpers and all his troops—and I will draw out the sword after them. They will know that I am the Lord when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries. But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague, so they can tell of their detestable practices among the nations where they go. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'"

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water. Say to the people of the land, 'This is what the Lord God says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food with anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there. The inhabited towns will be laid waste, and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.'"

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel: 'The days go by and every vision comes to nothing'? Say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: I am going to put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.' Say to them, 'The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled. For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel. But I, the Lord, will speak what I will, and it shall be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, you rebellious people, I will fulfill whatever I say, declares the Lord God.'"

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, the Israelites are saying, 'The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies about the distant future.' Therefore, say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: None of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares the Lord God.'"

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: 'Hear the word of the Lord! This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing! Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins. You have not gone up to the breaches in the wall to repair it for the people of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the Lord. Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. Even though the Lord has not sent them, they say, "The Lord declares," and expect him to fulfill their words. Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, "The Lord declares," though I have not spoken? Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Because of your false words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Lord God. My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord God. Because they lead my people astray, saying, "Peace," when there is no peace, and because when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash, therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and violent winds will burst forth. When the wall collapses, will people not ask you, "Where is the whitewash you covered it with?" Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: In my wrath, I will unleash a violent wind, and in my anger, hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury. I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you will be destroyed in it, and you will know that I am the Lord. So I will pour out my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. I will say to you, "The wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it, the prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Lord God."'

Now, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them and say, 'This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own? You have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to my people, who listen to lies, you have killed those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds, and I will tear them from your arms. I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds. I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands, and they will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Because you disheartened the righteous with your lies when I had brought them no grief, and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and so save their lives, therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will save my people from your hands. And then you will know that I am the Lord.'"

Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all? Therefore, speak to them and tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: When any of the Israelites set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet, I the Lord will answer them myself in keeping with their great idolatry. I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have all deserted me for their idols.' Therefore, say to the people of Israel, 'This is what the Lord God says: Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices! When any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing in Israel separate themselves from me and set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet to inquire of me, I the Lord will answer them myself. I will set my face against them and make them an example and a byword. I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord. And if the prophet is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the Lord have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel. They will bear their guilt—the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him. Then the people of Israel will no longer stray from me, nor will they defile themselves anymore with all their sins. They will be my people, and I will be their God, declares the Lord God.'"The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, when a land sins against me by being unfaithful, I will stretch out my hand against it. I will cut off its food supply and send famine upon it, killing both people and animals. Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in that land, they could only save themselves by their righteousness, declares the Lord God. If I send wild animals through the land and they make it desolate, so no one can pass through it because of the beasts, even if these three men were there, they could save neither their sons nor daughters; only they themselves would be saved, and the land would be desolate. Or if I bring a sword against that land and say, 'Let the sword pass through the land,' and I kill both people and animals, even if these three men were there, they could save neither their sons nor daughters; only they themselves would be saved. Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath upon it in bloodshed, killing both people and animals, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were there, they could save neither their sons nor daughters; they could only save themselves by their righteousness.

For this is what the Lord God says: How much worse will it be when I send my four severe judgments—sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague—against Jerusalem to kill both people and animals? Yet there will be some survivors—sons and daughters who will be brought out. When they come to you and you see their conduct and actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem, every disaster I have brought upon it. You will be consoled when you see their conduct and actions, and you will know that I have done nothing without cause, declares the Lord God."

The word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, how is the wood of a vine better than that of any branch among the trees of the forest? Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do people make pegs from it to hang things on? And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful after the fire has burned it and it is charred?

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I treat the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the Lord. I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Lord God."

Again, the word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices and say, 'This is what the Lord God says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. On the day you were born, your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised.

Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood, I said to you, "Live!" I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, you who were naked and bare.

Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord God, and you became mine. I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was fine flour, honey, and olive oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Lord God.

But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by, and your beauty became his. You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. You went to him, and he possessed your beauty. You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. Also, the food I provided for you—the fine flour, olive oil, and honey I gave you to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Lord God.

And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. In all your detestable practices and your prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood.

Woe! Woe to you, declares the Lord God. You built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. At every street corner, you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity. So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants, but even with this, you were not satisfied.

How weak-willed you are, declares the Lord God, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute because you scorned payment. You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. So in your prostitution, you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you.

Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the Lord! This is what the Lord God says: Because you poured out your lust and exposed your naked body in your promiscuity with your lovers and because of all your detestable idols and the blood of your children you gave to them, therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see all your nakedness. I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring upon you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. Then I will hand you over to your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you naked and bare. They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. Then my wrath against you will subside, and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry."You didn't remember your early days and have caused me grief with all your actions. So, I will repay you for your ways, says the Lord God, and you will not continue this lewdness among all your abominations. Everyone who uses proverbs will use this one against you: 'Like mother, like daughter.' You are your mother's daughter, who despised her husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who also despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. Your older sister is Samaria, who lives with her daughters to your left, and your younger sister is Sodom, who lives with her daughters to your right. You didn't follow their ways or do their detestable things, but you became more corrupt in all your ways than they were. As surely as I live, says the Lord God, your sister Sodom and her daughters did not do as you and your daughters have done. This was the sin of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters were arrogant, overfed, and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore, I did away with them as you have seen. Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all your detestable acts. Bear your disgrace, for you have provided justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.

When I restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and of Samaria and her daughters, I will also restore your fortunes along with them, so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort. Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, and Samaria and her daughters, will return to what they were before, and you and your daughters will return to what you were before. You did not mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines—all those around you who despise you. You must bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the Lord.

This is what the Lord God says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant. Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those older and younger than you. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you. I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord. Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Lord God.

The word of the Lord came to me: 'Son of man, tell a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel. Say: This is what the Lord God says: A great eagle with powerful wings, long feathers, and full plumage of various colors came to Lebanon and took hold of the top of a cedar. He broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants, where he planted it in a city of traders. He took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil; he placed it beside abundant waters and set it like a willow. It sprouted and became a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs.

But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage. The vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water. It had been planted in good soil by abundant waters to produce branches, bear fruit, and become a splendid vine. Say to them: This is what the Lord God says: Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots. Even if it is transplanted, will it thrive? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it—wither away in the plot where it grew?'

The word of the Lord came to me: 'Say to this rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Say to them: The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off its king and nobles, bringing them back with him to Babylon. Then he took a member of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the leading men of the land, so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his covenant. But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the covenant and yet escape?

As surely as I live, declares the Lord God, he will die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke. Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war, when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives. He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things, he shall not escape. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: As surely as I live, I will repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant. I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment upon him there because he was unfaithful to me. All his choice troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to the winds. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken.

This is what the Lord God says: I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it. I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain. On the mountain heights of Israel, I will plant it. It will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches. All the trees of the field will know that I the Lord bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. I the Lord have spoken, and I will do it.'

The word of the Lord came to me again: 'What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel: "The fathers eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge"? As surely as I live, declares the Lord God, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel. For every living soul belongs to me, the father as well as the son—both alike belong to me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.

Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right. He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife or have sexual relations with a woman during her period. He does not oppress anyone but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. He does not lend at interest or take a profit from them. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between two parties. He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous; he will surely live, declares the Lord God.

Suppose he has a violent son who sheds blood or does any of these other things (though the father has done none of them): He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbor's wife. He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things. He lends at interest and takes a profit. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he is to be put to death; his blood will be on his own head.

But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things: He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife. He does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. He withholds his hand from mistreating the poor and does not take interest or profit from them. He keeps my laws and follows my decrees. He will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live."If a person follows my rules and lives righteously, they will not be punished for their father's sins; they will live. However, if the father was cruel and committed wrongdoings, he will die for his own sins. People might ask why the son doesn't bear the father's guilt. The answer is that each person is responsible for their own actions. The one who sins will die, and the one who lives righteously will live.

If a wicked person turns away from their sins and follows my rules, they will live and not die. Their past sins will be forgotten, and they will be judged by their new righteous actions. I do not take pleasure in the death of the wicked; I want them to turn from their ways and live.

However, if a righteous person turns away from their righteousness and commits sins, they will die for their sins. Their past righteous deeds will not be remembered. People might say that my ways are not fair, but it is their ways that are unfair. When a righteous person turns to sin, they will die for it. When a wicked person turns away from sin and does what is right, they will save their life.

Therefore, I will judge each of you according to your actions. Repent and turn away from your sins so that they do not lead to your downfall. Create a new heart and spirit for yourselves. I do not take pleasure in anyone's death, so turn from your ways and live.

Now, take up a lament for the leaders of Israel. Say, "What is your mother? A lioness among lions, raising her cubs. One of her cubs became a strong lion, learning to hunt and devour people. The nations heard of him and captured him, taking him to Egypt. When she saw her hope was lost, she raised another cub to be a strong lion, who also learned to hunt and devour people. He destroyed their palaces and cities, and the land was desolate because of his roaring. The nations surrounded him, captured him, and took him to Babylon, where his voice would no longer be heard in Israel."

Your mother was like a vine planted by the waters, fruitful and full of branches. She had strong branches fit for rulers, and her stature was exalted. But she was uprooted in fury, cast to the ground, and her fruit dried up. Now she is planted in a dry and thirsty land, and fire has consumed her branches. This is a lament and will be used as a lament.

In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day, some elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord and sat before me. The word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Speak to the elders of Israel and tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not be inquired of by you. Will you judge them, son of man? Confront them with the detestable practices of their ancestors. Tell them that when I chose Israel and revealed myself to them in Egypt, I said, "I am the Lord your God." I promised to bring them out of Egypt into a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands. I told them to get rid of their detestable idols and not defile themselves with the idols of Egypt. But they rebelled against me and did not listen. They did not get rid of their idols, so I decided to pour out my wrath on them in Egypt. But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the wilderness. I gave them my decrees and laws, which bring life to those who obey them. I also gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I am the Lord who makes them holy.

But the people of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not follow my decrees and rejected my laws, which bring life to those who obey them. They desecrated my Sabbaths, so I decided to pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness. But for the sake of my name, I did not destroy them completely. I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had promised, a land flowing with milk and honey, because they rejected my laws and desecrated my Sabbaths. Yet I had compassion and did not destroy them completely. I told their children not to follow their parents' ways or defile themselves with idols. I am the Lord your God; follow my decrees and keep my laws. Keep my Sabbaths holy, and they will be a sign between us, so you will know that I am the Lord your God.

But the children also rebelled against me. They did not follow my decrees or keep my laws, which bring life to those who obey them. They desecrated my Sabbaths, so I decided to pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness. But for the sake of my name, I did not destroy them completely. I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations because they did not follow my decrees or keep my laws. They defiled themselves with idols, so I gave them over to statutes that were not good and laws they could not live by. I let them become defiled by their sacrifices, so they would know that I am the Lord.

Therefore, speak to the house of Israel and tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: Your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me. When I brought them into the land I had promised, they saw every high hill and leafy tree and offered their sacrifices there. They made offerings that provoked me to anger. I asked them, "What is this high place you go to?" It is called Bamah to this day. Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'This is what the Lord God says: Will you defile yourselves as your ancestors did and prostitute yourselves with their detestable idols? When you offer your gifts and sacrifice your children in the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols."Even now, you ask if you can seek guidance from me, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be consulted by you. You think you can be like other nations, serving idols made of wood and stone. But as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will rule over you with a mighty hand and outstretched arm, and with great fury. I will bring you out from the nations where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and outstretched arm, and with great fury. I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and judge you face to face, just as I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of Egypt. I will make you pass under the rod and bring you into the bond of the covenant. I will purge out the rebels and those who transgress against me. They will not enter the land of Israel, and you will know that I am the LORD.

As for you, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD, go and serve your idols if you will not listen to me. But do not profane my holy name with your gifts and idols anymore. On my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, all the people of Israel will serve me. There I will accept them and require their offerings and the firstfruits of their gifts, along with all their holy things. I will accept you with your pleasing aroma when I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered. I will be sanctified in you before the nations. You will know that I am the LORD when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land I promised to your ancestors. There you will remember your ways and all your deeds by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evils you have committed. You will know that I am the LORD when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways or corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.

The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'Son of man, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field. Say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD: I will kindle a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree and every dry tree. The blazing flame will not be quenched, and all faces from south to north will be scorched by it. All people will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it will not be quenched.' Then I said, 'Ah, Lord GOD! They say of me, "Does he not speak in parables?"'

The word of the LORD came to me again, saying, 'Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, preach against the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel. Say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous and the wicked. Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked, my sword will go out against all flesh from south to north. All people will know that I, the LORD, have drawn my sword from its sheath; it will not return again. Therefore, groan, son of man, with a broken heart and bitter grief before their eyes. When they ask you, "Why are you groaning?" you will say, "Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. It is coming and will surely happen," says the Lord GOD.'

The word of the LORD came to me again, saying, 'Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the LORD: A sword, a sword is sharpened and polished. It is sharpened for a great slaughter, polished to flash like lightning. Should we then rejoice? The rod of my son despises every tree. The sword is given to be polished, to be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished, ready for the hand of the slayer. Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Strike your thigh in despair. For it is a trial, and what if the sword despises even the rod? It will not be, says the Lord GOD. Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times. It is the sword for the great slaughter, the sword that surrounds them. I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, so that their hearts may melt and their many casualties be multiplied. Ah! It is made to flash like lightning, it is polished for slaughter. Turn to the right, turn to the left, wherever your blade is directed. I will also strike my hands together, and my wrath will subside. I, the LORD, have spoken.'

The word of the LORD came to me again, saying, 'Son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take; both will start from the same land. Make a signpost where the road branches off to the city. Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem. For the king of Babylon will stop at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen. He will cast lots with arrows, consult his idols, and examine the liver. In his right hand will be the lot for Jerusalem, to set up battering rams, to call for slaughter, to raise a battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp, and to erect siege works. It will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to them, but it will remind them of their guilt and take them captive.

Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you have brought your guilt to mind by your open rebellion, revealing your sins in all that you do—because you have come to mind, you will be taken captive. And you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment, this is what the Lord GOD says: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things will not remain as they are. Exalt the lowly and humble the exalted. A ruin, a ruin, I will make it a ruin! It will not be restored until he comes to whom it rightfully belongs; to him I will give it.

And you, son of man, prophesy and say, This is what the Lord GOD says concerning the Ammonites and their insults: A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter, polished to consume and to flash like lightning. Despite false visions and lying divinations about you, it will be laid on the necks of the wicked who are to be slain, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment. Return the sword to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. I will pour out my wrath on you and blow against you with the fire of my fury. I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, skilled in destruction. You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land. You will be remembered no more, for I, the LORD, have spoken.'""I have struck my hands in dismay at your dishonest gains and the bloodshed in your midst. Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong when I deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken and will act. I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, consuming your impurity. You will be defiled in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the LORD."

The word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me—all of them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead in the furnace; they are the dross of silver. Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem. Just as silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted, so I will gather you in my anger and fury, and I will melt you. I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the city. As silver is melted in the furnace, so you will be melted, and you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out my wrath on you."

The word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Son of man, say to her: 'You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.' There is a conspiracy among her prophets like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things, and make many widows. Her priests violate my law and profane my holy things; they make no distinction between the holy and the common, and they do not teach the difference between the unclean and the clean. They shut their eyes to my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. Her officials are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain. Her prophets whitewash these deeds with false visions and lying divinations, saying, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says,' when the LORD has not spoken. The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice. I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one. So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."

The word of the LORD came to me again, saying, "Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother. They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. Their breasts were fondled, and their virgin bosoms caressed. The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was mine; she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, mounted horsemen. She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, where men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom, and poured out their lust on her. Therefore, I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her.

Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution, she was more depraved than her sister. She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men. I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way. But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion, with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth when she was a prostitute in Egypt. There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side—the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards. I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your nose and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire. They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry. So I will put an end to your lewdness and your prostitution brought from Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.

For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you naked and bare, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity have brought this on you because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand.

This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You will drink your sister’s cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much. You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria. You will drink it and drain it dry; you will dash it to pieces and tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.

Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution."

The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices, for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. They have also done this to me: At that same time, they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.

They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived, you bathed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and put on your jewelry. You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and oil that belonged to me. The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the common people. They put bracelets on the arms of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads. Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, 'Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.' And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah. But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.

This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will bring a mob against them, and they will be stoned and cut to pieces with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses. So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you. You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.""I will hand them over to be taken away and plundered. The crowd will stone them and cut them down with swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses. This will put an end to lewdness in the land, and all women will learn not to follow your example. You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and idolatry, and you will know that I am the Lord God.

In the ninth year, on the tenth day of the tenth month, the word of the Lord came to me: 'Son of man, write down this date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem on this very day. Tell this rebellious house a parable: This is what the Lord God says: Put a pot on the fire, fill it with water, and add the best pieces of meat, the thigh and shoulder, and the choicest bones. Take the best of the flock and pile wood beneath it to make it boil. Let the bones cook in it.'

This is what the Lord God says: 'Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot now encrusted, whose deposit will not go away! Empty it piece by piece without casting lots for them. For the blood she shed is in her midst; she poured it on the bare rock, not on the ground, to cover it with dust. To stir up wrath and take vengeance, I put her blood on the bare rock, so it would not be covered.'

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: 'Woe to the city of bloodshed! I will make the pile of wood great. Heap on the wood and kindle the fire; cook the meat well, mixing in the spices, and let the bones be charred. Then set the empty pot on the coals until it becomes hot and its copper glows, so its impurities may be melted and its deposit burned away. It has frustrated all efforts; its heavy deposit has not been removed, not even by fire. Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided. I, the Lord, have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions, declares the Lord God.'

The word of the Lord came to me: 'Son of man, I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes with a single blow, but you must not lament or weep or let your tears flow. Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners.' So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.

Then the people asked me, 'Won't you tell us what these things have to do with us? Why are you acting like this?' So I said to them, 'The word of the Lord came to me: Say to the house of Israel, "This is what the Lord God says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary, the stronghold in which you take pride, the delight of your eyes, the object of your affection. The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword. And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners. You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of your sins and groan among yourselves. Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord God."

And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their heart's desire, and their sons and daughters as well—on that day a fugitive will come to tell you the news. At that time your mouth will be opened; you will speak and no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord.'

The word of the Lord came to me: 'Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them. Say to them, "Hear the word of the Lord God. This is what the Lord God says: Because you said 'Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile, therefore I will give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk. I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and Ammon into a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the Lord."

For this is what the Lord God says: Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel, therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the Lord.'

This is what the Lord God says: 'Because Moab and Seir said, "Look, the house of Judah has become like all the other nations," therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim—the glory of the land. I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations. I will inflict punishment on Moab, and they will know that I am the Lord.'

This is what the Lord God says: 'Because Edom took revenge on the house of Judah and became very guilty by doing so, therefore this is what the Lord God says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and kill both man and beast. I will lay it waste, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword. I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Lord God.'

This is what the Lord God says: 'Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah, therefore this is what the Lord God says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy those remaining along the coast. I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the Lord when I take vengeance on them.'

In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: 'Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, "Aha! The gate to the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will prosper," therefore this is what the Lord God says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves. They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock. She will become a place to spread fishnets in the sea, for I have spoken, declares the Lord God. She will become plunder for the nations, and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'

For this is what the Lord God says: 'I will bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and a great army. He will kill your daughters on the mainland with the sword. He will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls, and raise his shields against you. He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons. His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the war horses, wagons, and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through. The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber, and rubble into the sea. I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more. I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread fishnets. You will never be rebuilt, for I the Lord have spoken, declares the Lord God.'

This is what the Lord God says to Tyre: 'Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place in you? Then all the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and take off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you.'"The people will be shocked at your downfall. They will mourn for you, saying, "How could this great city, known for its seafaring men and strength, be destroyed?" The islands will tremble on the day of your fall, and those in the sea will be troubled by your departure.

The Lord God says, "When I make you a desolate city, like those that are uninhabited, and cover you with deep waters, I will bring you down to the pit with those from ancient times. You will be placed in the lower parts of the earth, in desolate places, and you will no longer be inhabited. I will bring glory to the land of the living. I will make you a terror, and you will be no more. Even if people search for you, they will never find you again," declares the Lord God.

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, mourn for Tyre. Say to Tyre, 'You who are situated at the entrance of the sea, a merchant of many islands, the Lord God says: Tyre, you have said, "I am perfect in beauty." Your borders are in the midst of the seas, and your builders have perfected your beauty. They made your ship boards from fir trees of Senir and took cedars from Lebanon for your masts. They made your oars from the oaks of Bashan and your benches from ivory brought from the islands of Chittim. Your sails were made from fine embroidered linen from Egypt, and your coverings were blue and purple from the islands of Elishah. The people of Zidon and Arvad were your mariners, and your wise men, Tyre, were your pilots. The elders of Gebal and their wise men were your caulkers. All the ships of the sea and their mariners were in you to trade your merchandise. Persia, Lud, and Phut were in your army, your men of war. They hung their shields and helmets in you, making you beautiful. The men of Arvad and your army were on your walls all around, and the Gammadims were in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around, perfecting your beauty.

Tarshish traded with you because of your great wealth of goods. They exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your merchandise. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded human beings and bronze vessels in your market. The house of Togarmah traded horses, horsemen, and mules. The men of Dedan traded with you, bringing ivory and ebony as presents. Syria traded with you because of your abundant goods, exchanging emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and agate. Judah and Israel traded with you, bringing wheat, honey, oil, and balm. Damascus traded with you because of your many goods, exchanging wine from Helbon and white wool. Dan and Javan traded bright iron, cassia, and calamus. Dedan traded precious clothes for chariots. Arabia and all the princes of Kedar traded lambs, rams, and goats. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded spices, precious stones, and gold. Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you, bringing blue clothes, embroidered work, rich apparel, and cedar chests bound with cords.

The ships of Tarshish sang of you in your market, and you were filled and made glorious in the midst of the seas. Your rowers brought you into great waters, but the east wind broke you in the midst of the seas. Your riches, merchandise, mariners, pilots, caulkers, and men of war will fall into the sea on the day of your ruin. The suburbs will shake at the sound of your pilots' cries. All who handle the oar, mariners, and sea pilots will come down from their ships and stand on the land. They will cry bitterly, cast dust on their heads, and wallow in ashes. They will shave their heads and wear sackcloth, weeping for you with bitter lamentation. They will mourn for you, saying, "What city is like Tyre, destroyed in the midst of the sea?" When your goods went out to sea, you enriched many people and kings with your wealth and merchandise. But now, you are broken by the seas, and your merchandise and all your company have fallen. The inhabitants of the islands will be astonished, and their kings will be terrified. The merchants among the people will hiss at you; you will become a terror and never exist again.

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, 'The Lord God says: Because your heart is proud and you have said, "I am a god; I sit in the seat of gods in the midst of the seas," yet you are a man and not a god, though you set your heart as the heart of a god. You are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you. With your wisdom and understanding, you have gained riches and gold and silver in your treasures. By your great wisdom and trade, you have increased your riches, and your heart is proud because of your wealth. Therefore, the Lord God says: Because you have set your heart as the heart of a god, I will bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations. They will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and defile your splendor. They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas. Will you still say, "I am a god," in the presence of those who kill you? You will be a man, not a god, in the hands of those who slay you. You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners, for I have spoken,' declares the Lord God.

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, mourn for the king of Tyre. Say to him, 'The Lord God says: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone adorned you: sardius, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, and gold. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created, they were prepared. You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for I ordained you. You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. Your heart became proud because of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings. By your many sins and dishonest trade, you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching. All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.'

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, "Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against it. Say, 'The Lord God says: I am against you, Sidon, and I will be glorified within you. They will know that I am the Lord when I execute judgments against her and show my holiness through her. I will send a plague upon her and blood in her streets. The slain will fall within her, and the sword will be against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the Lord. No longer will there be a pricking brier or a painful thorn for the house of Israel from all who are around them and despise them. Then they will know that I am the Lord God. The Lord God says: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, I will show myself holy through them in the sight of the nations. They will live in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. They will live there in safety, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will live in safety when I execute judgments on all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.'"The people of Israel will live safely in the land I gave to my servant Jacob. They will build houses, plant vineyards, and live securely when I bring judgment on those who despise them. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.

In the tenth year, on the twelfth day of the tenth month, the word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, turn your face against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and all of Egypt. Tell him, 'This is what the Lord God says: I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, you great monster lying in the Nile. You say, "The Nile is mine; I made it for myself." But I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will pull you out of your streams, with all the fish sticking to your scales. I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field and not be gathered or picked up. I will give you as food to the wild animals and birds. Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the Lord, because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. When they grasped you, you splintered and tore their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins shake. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I will bring a sword against you and cut off man and beast from you. Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the Lord. Because you said, "The Nile is mine; I made it," I am against you and your streams. I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of Cush. No foot of man or animal will pass through it; it will be uninhabited for forty years. I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands, and her cities will lie desolate for forty years among ruined cities. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries.

Yet, this is what the Lord God says: At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered. I will bring them back from captivity and return them to Pathros, the land of their origin. There they will be a lowly kingdom. It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations. Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the house of Israel but will remind them of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.

In the twenty-seventh year, on the first day of the first month, the word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw, yet he and his army received no reward from Tyre for the labor he expended on it. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will carry off its wealth, plunder it, and loot it, and it will be the wages for his army. I have given him Egypt as his payment for the labor he performed against Tyre, because they worked for me, declares the Lord God. On that day, I will make a horn grow for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the Lord."

The word of the Lord came to me again: "Son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord God says: Wail and say, "Woe to the day!" For the day is near, the day of the Lord is near—a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations. A sword will come against Egypt, and anguish will come upon Cush. When the slain fall in Egypt, her wealth will be carried away, and her foundations torn down. Cush, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya, and the people of the covenant land will fall by the sword along with Egypt. This is what the Lord says: The allies of Egypt will fall, and her proud strength will come down. From Migdol to Aswan they will fall by the sword within her, declares the Lord God. Egypt will become a desolate wasteland, and her cities will lie in ruins. Then they will know that I am the Lord when I set fire to Egypt and all her helpers are crushed. On that day, messengers will go out from me in ships to frighten Cush out of her complacency. Anguish will take hold of them on the day of Egypt's doom, for it is coming.

This is what the Lord God says: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He and his army—the most ruthless of nations—will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain. I will dry up the streams of the Nile and sell the land to evil men. By the hand of foreigners, I will lay waste the land and everything in it. I, the Lord, have spoken.

This is what the Lord God says: I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis. No longer will there be a prince in Egypt, and I will spread fear throughout the land. I will lay waste Upper Egypt, set fire to Zoan, and inflict punishment on Thebes. I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the hordes of Thebes. I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in agony, Thebes will be taken by storm, and Memphis will be in constant distress. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword, and the cities themselves will go into captivity. Dark will be the day at Tahpanhes when I break the yoke of Egypt; there her proud strength will come to an end. She will be covered with clouds, and her villages will go into captivity. So I will inflict punishment on Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord.

In the eleventh year, on the seventh day of the first month, the word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. It has not been bound up to be healed or put in a splint so that it can hold a sword. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I am against Pharaoh, king of Egypt. I will break both his arms, the strong one and the one already broken, and make the sword fall from his hand. I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries. I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him like a mortally wounded man. I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall. Then they will know that I am the Lord when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he brandishes it against Egypt. I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries. Then they will know that I am the Lord."

In the eleventh year, on the first day of the third month, the word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his hordes: 'Who can be compared with you in majesty? Consider Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest; it towered on high, its top above the thick foliage. The waters nourished it, deep springs made it grow tall; their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field. So it towered higher than all the trees of the field; its boughs increased and its branches grew long, spreading because of abundant waters. All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs, all the animals of the wild gave birth under its branches; all the great nations lived in its shade. It was majestic in beauty, with its spreading boughs, for its roots went down to abundant waters. The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor could the junipers equal its boughs, nor could the plane trees compare with its branches—no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty. I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God.

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Because it towered on high, lifting its top above the thick foliage, and because it was proud of its height, I gave it into the hands of the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with according to its wickedness. I cast it aside, and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it. Its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys; its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it. All the birds settled on the fallen tree, and all the wild animals lived among its branches. Therefore, no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height; they are all destined for death, for the earth below, among mortals who go down to the realm of the dead.The branches of the fallen tree lie scattered on the mountains and in the valleys, and all the people have abandoned its shade. Birds and wild animals now inhabit its remains. This is to ensure that no other trees by the waters grow too proud or tall. All trees that drink water will eventually die and join those who have descended to the grave.

The Lord God says: On the day the tree went down to the grave, I caused mourning. I covered the deep waters for it and held back the floods. I made Lebanon mourn, and all the trees of the field wilted. The nations trembled at the sound of its fall when I cast it down to the grave with those who descend into the pit. All the trees of Eden, the best of Lebanon, and all that drink water were comforted in the depths of the earth. They too went down to the grave with it, those who were killed by the sword, and those who lived under its shade among the nations.

Who can compare to you in glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down to the depths of the earth, lying among the uncircumcised, those killed by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord God.

In the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, the word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, lament for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and say to him: You are like a young lion among the nations, like a sea monster thrashing about in your rivers, muddying the waters with your feet. The Lord God says: I will spread my net over you with a company of many people, and they will haul you up in my net. I will leave you on the land, cast you on the open field, and all the birds of the sky will settle on you, and the beasts of the earth will gorge on you. I will scatter your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains. I will drench the land with your blood, even to the mountains, and the streams will be filled with you. When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and darken the stars. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. I will darken all the shining lights in the sky over you and bring darkness upon your land, declares the Lord God. I will trouble the hearts of many people when I bring your destruction among the nations, to lands you have not known. Many people will be appalled at you, and their kings will shudder with fear when I brandish my sword before them. They will tremble every moment, each for his own life, on the day of your downfall.

The Lord God says: The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you. I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of mighty warriors, the most ruthless of nations. They will shatter the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude will be destroyed. I will also destroy all its cattle from beside abundant waters, so neither man nor beast will muddy them anymore. Then I will let their waters settle and make their rivers flow like oil, declares the Lord God. When I make the land of Egypt desolate and strip it of all that fills it, when I strike down all who live there, they will know that I am the Lord.

This is the lament they will chant for Egypt and all its multitude, declares the Lord God.

In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: "Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt and bring them down, her and the daughters of mighty nations, to the depths of the earth, with those who go down to the pit. Who do you surpass in beauty? Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised. They will fall among those killed by the sword. She is delivered to the sword; draw her and all her multitudes. The mighty warriors will speak to Pharaoh from the depths of the grave, along with his allies who helped him. They have gone down, lying uncircumcised, killed by the sword.

Assyria is there with her whole company, their graves all around her, all of them killed by the sword. Their graves are set in the depths of the pit, and her company is all around her grave, all of them killed by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living. Elam is there with all her multitude around her grave, all of them killed by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the depths of the earth, who spread terror in the land of the living. They bear their shame with those who go down to the pit. They have made her a bed among the slain with all her multitude, her graves all around her, all of them uncircumcised, killed by the sword. Though they spread terror in the land of the living, they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit. They are placed among the slain.

Meshech and Tubal are there with all their multitude, their graves all around them, all of them uncircumcised, killed by the sword, though they spread terror in the land of the living. They do not lie with the mighty who have fallen of the uncircumcised, who went down to the grave with their weapons of war. Their swords were placed under their heads, but their iniquities rest upon their bones, though they spread terror in the land of the living. You too will be broken and lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.

Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who despite their might, lie with those killed by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the pit. The princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there, who went down with the slain. They spread terror by their might, but they lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword, bearing their shame with those who go down to the pit. Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, killed by the sword, declares the Lord God. Though I spread terror in the land of the living, Pharaoh and all his multitude will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword, declares the Lord God.

The word of the Lord came to me again: "Son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman, and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people, then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not heed the warning and the sword comes and takes their life, their blood will be on their own head. Since they heard the sound of the trumpet but did not heed the warning, their blood will be on their own head. If they had heeded the warning, they would have saved themselves. But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone's life, that person's life will be taken because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.

Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. When I say to the wicked, 'You wicked person, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, though you yourself will be saved.

Son of man, say to the Israelites: 'This is what you are saying: "Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live?" Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?'If a wicked person returns what they stole, follows the laws of life, and avoids sin, they will surely live and not die. None of their past sins will be remembered; they will live because they did what is right. However, the people say, "The way of the Lord is not fair." But it is their ways that are unfair. When a righteous person turns to sin, they will die because of it. But if a wicked person turns from their wickedness and does what is right, they will live.

In the twelfth year of our captivity, on the tenth month and fifth day, someone who escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has fallen." That evening, before the escapee arrived, the Lord's hand was upon me, and my mouth was opened. The next morning, I could speak again.

The Lord then spoke to me, saying, "Son of man, those living in the ruins of Israel say, 'Abraham was one man and inherited the land, but we are many; surely the land is given to us.' Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: You eat meat with blood, worship idols, and commit murder. Should you then possess the land? You rely on your swords, commit abominations, and defile your neighbor's wife. Should you possess the land?'"

The Lord continues, "As I live, those in the ruins will fall by the sword, those in the open field will be devoured by beasts, and those in strongholds and caves will die of disease. I will make the land desolate, and its pride will cease. The mountains of Israel will be deserted, and no one will pass through. Then they will know that I am the Lord when I make the land desolate because of their abominations."

The Lord also says, "Son of man, the people talk about you by the walls and at the doors of their houses, saying, 'Come and hear what the Lord has to say.' They come to you as people do, sit before you, and listen to your words, but they do not act on them. They speak with love, but their hearts are set on their own gain. To them, you are like a beautiful song, well-played on an instrument. They hear your words but do not act on them. When what you have said comes to pass—and it will—they will know that a prophet has been among them."

The Lord then speaks against the leaders of Israel, saying, "Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Shouldn't shepherds take care of the flock? You eat the fat, wear the wool, and slaughter the best animals, but you do not take care of the flock. You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bound up the injured, brought back the strays, or searched for the lost. Instead, you have ruled them harshly and brutally. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild animals. My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them."

The Lord declares, "Because my flock lacks a shepherd and has become prey, I am against the shepherds. I will hold them accountable for my flock and stop them from feeding the flock. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them. I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. I will bring them out from the nations, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the settlements in the land. I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Lord God. I will search for the lost, bring back the strays, bind up the injured, and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice."

The Lord continues, "I will judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats. Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet?"

Therefore, the Lord God says, "I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away, I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge between one sheep and another. I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd. I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I, the Lord, have spoken."

The Lord promises, "I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests in safety. I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a blessing. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing. The trees will yield their fruit, and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the Lord when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them. They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid. I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations. Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them and that they, the Israelites, are my people, declares the Lord God. You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Lord God."

The Lord then speaks against Mount Seir, saying, "I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you desolate. I will lay waste your towns, and you will become desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax, therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord God, I will give you over to bloodshed, and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you. I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go. I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and all your ravines. I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Because you have said, 'These two nations and countries will be ours, and we will take possession of them,' even though I, the Lord, was there, therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord God, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy you showed in your hatred of them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, 'They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.' You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it."The Lord says, "When the whole world celebrates, I will make you desolate, Mount Seir. Just as you rejoiced when Israel was desolate, so will I make you desolate. All of Edom will know that I am the Lord."

The Lord continues, "Prophesy to the mountains of Israel. Tell them that because the enemy has claimed their ancient high places, they have become desolate and mocked by surrounding nations. But I, the Lord, am speaking in my jealousy and anger against these nations. They will bear their shame, but you, mountains of Israel, will flourish and bear fruit for my people, who are coming back. I will make you prosperous again, better than before, and you will know that I am the Lord. My people will live on you, and you will no longer be barren or cause them to fall."

The Lord also says, "When Israel lived in their land, they defiled it with their actions, so I scattered them among the nations. But for the sake of my holy name, which they profaned, I will bring them back to their land. I will cleanse them with clean water, give them a new heart and spirit, and they will follow my laws. They will live in the land I gave their ancestors, and I will be their God. I will save them from their impurities, bless their crops, and they will no longer suffer famine. They will remember their evil ways and be ashamed. This is not for their sake, but for my holy name."

The Lord declares, "On the day I cleanse you, I will rebuild your cities and make the desolate land like the Garden of Eden. The nations around you will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt and replanted. I will increase your population like a flock, and they will know that I am the Lord."

The Lord's hand was upon me, and He brought me to a valley full of dry bones. He asked if the bones could live, and I said only He knows. He told me to prophesy to the bones, and they came together, but had no breath. Then He told me to prophesy to the wind, and breath entered them, and they lived. The Lord said these bones are the people of Israel, who feel hopeless. He will open their graves, bring them to Israel, and put His spirit in them so they will live and know He is the Lord.

The Lord told me to take two sticks, one for Judah and one for Joseph, and join them together as one. This symbolizes the reunification of Israel. He will gather the Israelites from all nations and make them one nation in their own land.The Lord says, "When the whole world celebrates, I will make you desolate, Mount Seir. Just as you rejoiced when Israel was desolate, so will I make you desolate. All of Edom will know that I am the Lord."

The Lord told me to take two sticks, one for Judah and one for Joseph, and join them together as one. This symbolizes the reunification of Israel. He will gather the Israelites from all nations and make them one nation in their own land. One king will rule over them, and they will no longer be divided into two kingdoms. They will no longer defile themselves with idols or detestable things. I will save them from their sinful places and cleanse them. They will be my people, and I will be their God. My servant David will be their king, and they will follow my laws and decrees. They will live in the land I gave to Jacob, where their ancestors lived, and they and their descendants will live there forever. I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant. I will establish my sanctuary among them forever. The nations will know that I, the Lord, make Israel holy when my sanctuary is among them forever."

The Lord spoke to me, saying, "Son of man, set your face against Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him. Tell him that I am against him and will turn him around, putting hooks in his jaws, and bring him out with his whole army. Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya will be with them, all with shields and helmets. Gomer and all its troops, and the house of Togarmah from the far north with all its troops, and many nations with you. Be prepared and get ready, you and all your hordes gathered about you, and take command of them. After many days, you will be called to arms. In future years, you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety. You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land."

The Lord says, "On that day, thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme. You will say, 'I will invade a land of unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people—all of them living without walls and without gates and bars. I will plunder and loot and turn my hand against the resettled ruins and the people gathered from the nations, rich in livestock and goods, living at the center of the land.' Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all her villages will say to you, 'Have you come to plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods and to seize much plunder?'"

"Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: In that day, when my people Israel are living in safety, will you not take notice of it? You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army. You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come, Gog, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am proved holy through you before their eyes.'"

"This is what the Sovereign Lord says: 'Are you not the one I spoke of in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel? At that time they prophesied for years that I would bring you against them. This is what will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign Lord. In my zeal and fiery wrath, I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. The fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the beasts of the field, every creature that moves along the ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble, and every wall will fall to the ground. I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign Lord. Every man's sword will be against his brother. I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones, and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him. And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'"

"Son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. I will turn you around and drag you along. I will bring you from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel. Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. On the mountains of Israel, you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals. You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord. I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the Lord. I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I, the Lord, am the Holy One in Israel. It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign Lord. This is the day I have spoken of.'"

"Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel. They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign Lord."

"On that day, I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east of the sea. It will block the way of travelers because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog. For seven months, the Israelites will be burying them in order to cleanse the land. All the people of the land will bury them, and the day I display my glory will be a memorable day for them, declares the Sovereign Lord. People will be continually employed in cleansing the land. They will spread out across the land and, along with others, they will bury any bodies that are lying on the ground. After the seven months, they will carry out a more detailed search. As they go through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will leave a marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog. Also, a town called Hamonah will be there. And so they will cleanse the land."

"Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals: 'Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood. You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth as if they were rams and lambs, goats and bulls—all of them fattened animals from Bashan. At the sacrifice I am preparing for you, you will eat fat till you are glutted and drink blood till you are drunk. At my table, you will eat your fill of horses and riders, mighty men and soldiers of every kind,' declares the Sovereign Lord."

"I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay on them. From that day forward, the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God. And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword. I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses, and I hid my face from them."

"Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will now restore the fortunes of Jacob and will have compassion on all the people of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name. They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid. When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations.""They will know that I am the LORD their God, who sent them into exile among the nations, but now I have brought them back to their own land, leaving none behind. I will no longer hide my face from them, for I have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD."

In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, fourteen years after the city was struck down, the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me to Israel. In visions from God, he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, where I saw a structure like a city to the south. There, a man whose appearance was like bronze stood with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand, at the gate.

The man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, hear with your ears, and pay attention to everything I show you, for you have been brought here so that I might show it to you. Tell the house of Israel everything you see."

I saw a wall surrounding the temple area. The measuring rod in the man's hand was six long cubits, each cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one rod thick and one rod high. Then he went to the gate facing east, climbed its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep. Each alcove was one rod long and one rod wide, and the space between the alcoves was five cubits. The threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep.

He measured the portico of the gate; it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gate faced the temple. Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; all three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements. He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway; it was ten cubits, and the length of the gateway was thirteen cubits. In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square.

Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one alcove to the roof of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one door to the opposite door. He measured the projecting walls to be sixty cubits high. The gateway extended around to the projecting walls. From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the portico of the inner gate was fifty cubits. The alcoves and their projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow windows all around, as was the portico; the windows were all around inside. The projecting walls were decorated with palm trees.

Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement. It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement. Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.

Next, he measured the length and width of the north gate leading into the outer court. Its alcoves—three on each side—its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its openings, its portico, and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was one on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.

Then he led me to the south side, and I saw a gate facing south. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had narrow windows all around, like the other gateways; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. It had palm tree decorations on the projecting walls on each side. The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits.

Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. Its alcoves, projecting walls, and portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had windows all around, like the other gateways; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep. Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it.

Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. Its alcoves, projecting walls, and portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had windows all around, like the other gateways; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it.

Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it; it had the same measurements as the others. Its alcoves, projecting walls, and portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had windows all around, like the other gateways; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it.

A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were slaughtered. By the outside wall of the portico, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gateway, were two tables, and on the other side of the portico were two tables. So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit high. On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices. Hooks, a handbreadth long, were attached all around the inside of the room, and on the tables was the flesh of the offerings.

Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one at the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the south gate and facing north. He said to me, "The room facing south is for the priests who guard the temple, and the room facing north is for the priests who guard the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the LORD to minister before him."

Then he measured the court; it was square—a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple. He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits, and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either side. The portico was twenty cubits wide and twelve cubits deep, and ten steps led up to it. There were pillars by the jambs, one on each side.

Then he brought me to the main hall and measured the jambs; they were six cubits wide on each side. The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits wide. He also measured the main hall; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits wide. And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place."

Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits wide. The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple. The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor.The structure of the temple increased in width from the lowest chamber to the highest. The foundation of the side chambers was six large cubits high. The wall of the side chamber was five cubits thick. The space between the chambers was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. The doors of the side chambers faced the remaining space, with one door facing north and another facing south. The remaining space was five cubits wide all around.

The building in front of the separate area at the west end was seventy cubits wide, with a wall five cubits thick and a length of ninety cubits. The entire temple, including the separate area and the building with its walls, measured one hundred cubits long. The width of the temple and the separate area toward the east was also one hundred cubits.

He measured the length of the building facing the separate area, including the galleries on both sides, which was one hundred cubits. The inner temple and the porches of the court were also measured. The doorposts, narrow windows, and galleries on three levels were covered with wood from the ground up to the windows, which were also covered. The walls inside and outside the temple were measured, and they were decorated with cherubim and palm trees, with a palm tree between each cherub. Each cherub had two faces: a human face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion's face toward the palm tree on the other side. This decoration was all around the temple.

From the ground to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the walls of the temple. The doorposts of the temple were square, and the appearance of the sanctuary was the same as the rest of the temple. The wooden altar was three cubits high and two cubits long, with corners and walls made of wood. He said to me, "This is the table that stands before the LORD."

The temple and the sanctuary had two doors, each with two folding leaves. The doors were decorated with cherubim and palm trees, similar to the walls, and had thick planks on the porch's exterior. There were narrow windows and palm trees on both sides of the porch and the side chambers of the temple, with thick planks.

He then brought me to the outer court, toward the north, into a chamber facing the separate area and the building to the north. The chamber was one hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. Opposite the twenty cubits of the inner court and the pavement of the outer court, there were galleries on three levels. In front of the chambers was a ten-cubit-wide walkway, with a one-cubit-wide path, and their doors faced north.

The upper chambers were shorter because the galleries were higher than the lower and middle levels of the building. The building had no pillars like those in the courts, so it was narrower at the top than at the lower and middle levels. The wall opposite the chambers, toward the outer court, was fifty cubits long. The chambers in the outer court were fifty cubits long, and the area in front of the temple was one hundred cubits long. The entrance to these chambers was on the east side, as one entered from the outer court.

The chambers in the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separate area and the building, had a similar appearance to the chambers facing north. They were the same length and width, with similar exits and doors. The doors of the chambers facing south had a door at the head of the way, directly before the wall toward the east, as one entered them.

He said to me, "The north and south chambers facing the separate area are holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. They will place the most holy offerings, grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings there, for the place is holy. When the priests enter, they must not go out into the outer court without changing their holy garments, for they are holy. They must put on other garments before approaching the people."

After measuring the inner house, he brought me out through the east gate and measured the area around it. He measured the east side with a measuring reed, five hundred reeds. He measured the north side, five hundred reeds. He measured the south side, five hundred reeds. He turned to the west side and measured five hundred reeds. He measured all four sides, and it had a wall around it, five hundred reeds long and five hundred reeds wide, to separate the holy from the common.

Afterward, he brought me to the gate facing east. I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory. The vision was like the one I had seen when He came to destroy the city and by the river Chebar. I fell on my face, and the glory of the LORD entered the temple through the east gate. The Spirit lifted me and brought me into the inner court, where the glory of the LORD filled the temple.

I heard Him speaking to me from the temple, and the man stood beside me. He said, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will no longer defile my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their idolatry and the corpses of their kings at their high places. When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger. Now let them put away their idolatry and the corpses of their kings far from me, and I will dwell among them forever.

"Son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them measure the pattern. If they are ashamed of all they have done, show them the design of the temple, its layout, exits, entrances, and all its regulations and laws. Write these down before them so they may follow its design and all its regulations.

"This is the law of the temple: The entire area on top of the mountain will be most holy. This is the law of the temple.

"These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): The base shall be a cubit high and a cubit wide, with a rim one span wide around its edge. This will be the height of the altar. From the base on the ground to the lower ledge, it will be two cubits high and one cubit wide. From the lower ledge to the upper ledge, it will be four cubits high and one cubit wide. The altar hearth will be four cubits high, with four horns projecting upward from the hearth. The altar hearth will be twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide, square at its four corners. The upper ledge will be fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide, with a rim half a cubit wide and a base one cubit wide all around. The steps of the altar will face east."

He said to me, "Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: These are the regulations for the altar on the day it is built, for offering burnt offerings and sprinkling blood on it. You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the Sovereign LORD. You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, the four corners of the upper ledge, and all around the rim."Apply the blood to the four horns of the altar, the four corners of the ledge, and the surrounding border to cleanse and purify it. Burn the bull used for the sin offering outside the sanctuary. On the second day, offer a flawless goat as a sin offering to cleanse the altar, just as you did with the bull. After cleansing, offer a flawless young bull and a ram from the flock. Present them before the LORD, and the priests will sprinkle salt on them and offer them as burnt offerings. For seven days, prepare a goat each day for a sin offering, along with a flawless young bull and a ram. Purify the altar and consecrate it for seven days. After these days, on the eighth day and onward, the priests will offer your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar, and I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD.

Then he took me back to the east-facing outer sanctuary gate, which was shut. The LORD told me, 'This gate will remain shut because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it. Only the prince may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he will enter and exit through the porch of this gate.'

He then led me to the north gate of the house, where I saw the glory of the LORD filling the house, and I fell on my face. The LORD said to me, 'Son of man, pay close attention to all the ordinances and laws of the house of the LORD. Note the entrance and exits of the sanctuary. Tell the rebellious house of Israel that their abominations are enough. They have brought foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, into my sanctuary, defiling it while offering my bread, fat, and blood, breaking my covenant. They have not kept charge of my holy things but appointed others to oversee my sanctuary.

No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or flesh, shall enter my sanctuary. The Levites who strayed from me when Israel went astray will bear their punishment. They will serve in my sanctuary, managing the gates and offering sacrifices for the people. Because they led Israel into sin, they will bear their shame and not come near me to serve as priests. They will be responsible for the temple's maintenance and all its work.

However, the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who remained faithful when Israel went astray, will minister to me. They will stand before me to offer sacrifices. They will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to serve me. When they enter the inner court, they will wear linen garments, not wool, to avoid sweating. They will wear linen turbans and trousers. When they go to the outer court, they will change out of their holy garments to avoid sanctifying the people with them. They will not shave their heads or let their hair grow long but will keep it trimmed. They will not drink wine when entering the inner court. They will marry only virgins from Israel or widows of priests. They will teach my people to distinguish between the holy and the common, the clean and the unclean. They will serve as judges, following my laws and statutes, and keep my Sabbaths holy. They will not defile themselves by touching a dead person, except for close family members. After being cleansed, they will wait seven days before re-entering the sanctuary to minister.

Their inheritance is me; they will not own land in Israel. They will eat the grain, sin, and guilt offerings, and everything dedicated to the LORD. The first fruits of all kinds and the first of your dough will belong to the priests, bringing a blessing to your house. They will not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals.

When you divide the land for inheritance, set aside a holy portion for the LORD, measuring 25,000 by 10,000 reeds. This will include the sanctuary and its surrounding area. The priests will have a portion for their houses and the sanctuary. The Levites will have a portion for their chambers. The city will have a portion measuring 5,000 by 25,000 reeds for the whole house of Israel. The prince will have land on both sides of the holy portion and the city's property, extending from the west to the east border. The princes will no longer oppress my people but will distribute the land fairly among the tribes of Israel.

The LORD says, 'O princes of Israel, stop your violence and oppression. Execute justice and righteousness. Use honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath. The ephah and bath will be the same size, each containing a tenth of a homer. The shekel will be twenty gerahs, with a maneh equaling sixty shekels. This is the offering you will give: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat and barley, a tenth of a bath of oil from a cor, and one lamb from every two hundred from the pastures of Israel for grain, burnt, and peace offerings to make atonement for the people. All the people will give this offering to the prince in Israel. The prince will provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings for the festivals, new moons, Sabbaths, and all appointed feasts of Israel. He will prepare the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.'"The Lord GOD says: On the first day of the first month, take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary. The priest will take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, the four corners of the altar, and the posts of the inner court gate. Do this again on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has sinned unintentionally or out of ignorance, to make atonement for the house.

On the fourteenth day of the first month, celebrate the Passover, a seven-day feast where unleavened bread is eaten. On that day, the prince will prepare a bull as a sin offering for himself and all the people. For the seven days of the feast, he will offer seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as burnt offerings to the LORD, along with a daily sin offering of a young goat. He will also prepare a grain offering of an ephah for each bull and ram, and a hin of oil for each ephah.

In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day, he will do the same for the seven-day feast, offering the same sacrifices and grain offerings.

The Lord GOD says: The inner court gate facing east will be closed on the six working days but open on the Sabbath and the new moon. The prince will enter through the porch of that gate and stand by the gatepost while the priests prepare his burnt and peace offerings. He will worship at the threshold of the gate, and then leave, but the gate will remain open until evening. The people will worship at the gate on Sabbaths and new moons.

On the Sabbath, the prince will offer six lambs and a ram without blemish as burnt offerings. The grain offering will be an ephah for the ram and as much as he can give for the lambs, along with a hin of oil for each ephah. On the new moon, he will offer a young bull, six lambs, and a ram, all without blemish, with the same grain and oil offerings.

When the prince enters, he will use the porch of the gate and exit the same way. When the people come to worship during the festivals, those entering through the north gate will leave by the south gate, and vice versa. No one will return through the gate they entered. The prince will be among them, entering and exiting with the people.

During the festivals, the grain offering will be an ephah for each bull and ram, and as much as he can give for the lambs, with a hin of oil for each ephah. If the prince makes a voluntary burnt or peace offering, the east-facing gate will be opened for him, and he will offer his sacrifices as on the Sabbath. After he leaves, the gate will be closed.

Every morning, a year-old lamb without blemish will be offered as a daily burnt offering to the LORD. A grain offering of a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil will be prepared each morning as a perpetual ordinance.

The Lord GOD says: If the prince gives a gift from his inheritance to his sons, it will belong to them. If he gives a gift to a servant, it will revert to the prince in the year of liberty, but his sons' inheritance will remain theirs. The prince must not take the people's inheritance by force, but give his sons their inheritance from his own property, so the people are not displaced.

He then took me through the entrance beside the gate to the priests' holy chambers facing north. There was a place on the west side where the priests would boil the guilt and sin offerings and bake the grain offerings, so they wouldn't have to take them out to the outer court and sanctify the people.

He led me to the outer court and showed me four small courts, one in each corner. Each court was 40 cubits long and 30 cubits wide, with rows of stone around them and places for boiling under the rows. He said, "These are the kitchens where the temple ministers will boil the sacrifices for the people."

Afterward, he brought me back to the temple entrance, where I saw water flowing eastward from under the temple threshold. The water flowed from the south side of the temple, past the altar. He led me out through the north gate and around to the east-facing outer gate, where I saw water trickling from the south side.

He measured a thousand cubits eastward and led me through ankle-deep water. He measured another thousand cubits and led me through knee-deep water. Another thousand cubits brought us to waist-deep water. After another thousand cubits, the water was too deep to cross, a river to swim in.

He asked, "Son of man, do you see this?" Then he led me back to the riverbank, where I saw many trees on both sides. He said, "These waters flow eastward, down to the desert and into the sea, making the salty water fresh. Wherever the river flows, there will be many fish and living creatures. Fishermen will stand along the shore from En Gedi to En Eglaim, spreading their nets. The fish will be as abundant as those in the Great Sea. However, the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will remain salty.

Fruit trees of all kinds will grow along both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. They will bear new fruit every month because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing."

The Lord GOD says: These are the borders by which you will divide the land among the twelve tribes of Israel, with Joseph receiving two portions. You will inherit it equally, as I promised your ancestors. This land will be your inheritance.You will divide this land among the tribes of Israel. Foreigners living among you who have children will be treated as native-born Israelites and will share the inheritance with you. They will receive their inheritance in the tribe where they live, declares the Lord GOD.

Here are the names of the tribes and their portions of land:

- From the northern end, along the way to Hethlon, to Hamath, and Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath: a portion for Dan.
- Next to Dan, from the east side to the west side: a portion for Asher.
- Next to Asher, from the east side to the west side: a portion for Naphtali.
- Next to Naphtali, from the east side to the west side: a portion for Manasseh.
- Next to Manasseh, from the east side to the west side: a portion for Ephraim.
- Next to Ephraim, from the east side to the west side: a portion for Reuben.
- Next to Reuben, from the east side to the west side: a portion for Judah.

In the middle of Judah's portion, you will set aside a special offering to the LORD, measuring 25,000 reeds in length and 10,000 in width. The sanctuary will be in the center of this area. This holy offering will be for the priests, the sons of Zadok, who remained faithful when the Israelites went astray. The Levites will have a portion next to the priests' land, measuring 25,000 by 10,000 reeds. This land is holy and cannot be sold or exchanged.

The remaining 5,000 reeds in width will be for the city, its dwellings, and suburbs. The city will measure 4,500 reeds on each side, with suburbs extending 250 reeds in each direction. The rest of the land, 10,000 reeds eastward and westward, will be for food for those who serve the city. All the tribes of Israel will contribute to the city's service.

The remaining land will be for the prince, located on either side of the holy offering and the city's property. The sanctuary will be in the center of this area. The prince's land will extend from the border of Judah to the border of Benjamin.

The rest of the tribes will receive their portions as follows:

- Benjamin: from the east side to the west side.
- Simeon: next to Benjamin, from the east side to the west side.
- Issachar: next to Simeon, from the east side to the west side.
- Zebulun: next to Issachar, from the east side to the west side.
- Gad: next to Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, extending southward to Tamar and the waters of Meribah Kadesh, to the river and the Great Sea.

This is the land you will divide among the tribes of Israel for inheritance, declares the Lord GOD.

The city gates will be named after the tribes of Israel:

- North side: Reuben, Judah, Levi.
- East side: Joseph, Benjamin, Dan.
- South side: Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun.
- West side: Gad, Asher, Naphtali.

The city will measure 18,000 reeds in circumference, and its name from that day will be "The LORD is there."

In the third year of King Jehoiakim's reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem. The Lord delivered Jehoiakim into his hand, along with some of the temple's treasures, which Nebuchadnezzar took to the land of Shinar and placed in the house of his god.

Nebuchadnezzar ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family and nobility—young men without physical defect, handsome, skilled in wisdom, knowledgeable, and capable of serving in the king's palace. They were to be taught the language and literature of the Chaldeans. The king assigned them a daily portion of his food and wine for three years, after which they would serve the king.

Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from Judah. The chief eunuch gave them new names: Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego.

Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the king's food and wine, so he asked the chief eunuch for permission to abstain. God granted Daniel favor with the chief eunuch, who was concerned that Daniel and his friends might look worse than the other young men, endangering his own life. Daniel proposed a ten-day test, during which they would eat only vegetables and drink water. At the end of the ten days, they looked healthier than the others, so the steward continued to provide them with vegetables.

God gave these four young men knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom, and Daniel could understand visions and dreams. At the end of their training, they were presented to King Nebuchadnezzar, who found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his kingdom. Daniel remained in the king's service until the first year of King Cyrus.

In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, he had troubling dreams that disturbed his sleep. He summoned magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to interpret his dreams.The Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, saying, "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it." The king replied, "I can't remember the dream. If you don't tell me the dream and its interpretation, you'll be torn apart, and your houses will be destroyed. But if you do, you'll receive gifts, rewards, and great honor. So, tell me the dream and its interpretation."

They responded again, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it." The king said, "I know you're stalling because you see that I can't remember the dream. If you don't tell me the dream, there's only one penalty for you. You've conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So, tell me the dream, and I'll know you can interpret it."

The Chaldeans answered, "No one on earth can do what the king asks! No king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such a thing from any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans."

This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. So, the decree was issued, and they began looking for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.

Daniel spoke with wisdom and tact to Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon. He asked Arioch, "Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?" Arioch explained the matter to Daniel. At this, Daniel went to the king and asked for time so that he might interpret the dream for him.

Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven and said, "Praise be to the name of God forever and ever; wisdom and power are his. He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him. I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors: You have given me wisdom and power, and you have made known to me what we asked of you; you have made known to us the dream of the king."

Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him."

Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means." The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?"

Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician, or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:

"As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.

"Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.

"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; in your hands, he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.

"After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.

"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold to pieces.

"The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy."

Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery."

Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. Moreover, at Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.

King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. So, the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.

Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do: As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace."

Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

At this time, some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews. They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "May the king live forever! Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up."Nebuchadnezzar, furious, ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be brought before him. He asked them if it was true that they did not serve his gods or worship the golden statue he had set up. He warned them that if they did not bow down when they heard the music, they would be thrown into a blazing furnace. The three men replied that their God could save them, but even if He did not, they would not serve Nebuchadnezzar's gods or worship the statue.

Enraged, Nebuchadnezzar ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual and commanded his strongest soldiers to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the furnace. The furnace was so hot that the flames killed the soldiers who took them up. The three men, bound, fell into the furnace.

Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and asked his counselors if they had thrown three men into the fire. They confirmed it. He then exclaimed that he saw four men walking around in the fire, unharmed, and the fourth looked like a divine being. Nebuchadnezzar approached the furnace and called for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to come out. They emerged unscathed, without even the smell of fire on them.

Nebuchadnezzar praised their God for sending an angel to rescue them and decreed that anyone who spoke against their God would be punished severely. He then promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in Babylon.

Later, Nebuchadnezzar had another troubling dream and called for all the wise men of Babylon to interpret it, but they could not. Finally, Daniel, also known as Belteshazzar, came before him. Nebuchadnezzar described his dream of a great tree that provided for all creatures but was ordered to be cut down by a heavenly messenger, leaving only the stump bound with iron and bronze.

Daniel interpreted the dream, explaining that the tree represented Nebuchadnezzar himself, who had grown powerful. However, he would be driven away from people to live like an animal until he acknowledged that God rules over human kingdoms. The stump meant his kingdom would be restored once he recognized God's sovereignty.

A year later, as Nebuchadnezzar boasted about his achievements, a voice from heaven declared that his kingdom was taken from him. He was driven away to live like an animal until he acknowledged God's rule. After this period, Nebuchadnezzar's sanity was restored, and he praised and honored God, recognizing His eternal dominion.Nebuchadnezzar praised and honored the King of Heaven, acknowledging that all His works are true and His ways just. He recognized that those who walk in pride can be humbled by God.

King Belshazzar held a grand feast for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them. He ordered the golden and silver vessels taken from the temple in Jerusalem to be brought so that he, his nobles, wives, and concubines could drink from them. They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.

Suddenly, fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the wall of the king's palace. Belshazzar was terrified and called for the astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers to interpret the writing. He promised that whoever could read and interpret it would be clothed in scarlet, given a gold chain, and made the third ruler in the kingdom. However, none of the wise men could interpret the writing, which greatly troubled the king.

The queen suggested that Belshazzar call for Daniel, who had the spirit of the holy gods and had previously demonstrated wisdom and understanding. Daniel was brought before the king, who asked if he could interpret the writing. Daniel declined the king's rewards but agreed to interpret the writing.

Daniel reminded Belshazzar of how God had given Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, majesty, glory, and honor, but when Nebuchadnezzar became proud, he was deposed and lived like an animal until he acknowledged God's sovereignty. Daniel then rebuked Belshazzar for not humbling himself despite knowing all this and for using the sacred vessels to praise false gods.

Daniel interpreted the writing: "MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN." He explained that "MENE" meant God had numbered the days of Belshazzar's kingdom and brought it to an end, "TEKEL" meant Belshazzar had been weighed and found wanting, and "PERES" meant the kingdom would be divided and given to the Medes and Persians.

Belshazzar honored Daniel with scarlet clothing, a gold chain, and proclaimed him the third ruler in the kingdom. That very night, Belshazzar was killed, and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom.

Darius appointed 120 princes to govern the kingdom and three presidents to oversee them, with Daniel being the foremost. Daniel's exceptional spirit made him stand out, and Darius considered setting him over the entire realm. This made the other presidents and princes jealous, and they sought to find fault in Daniel but could not because he was faithful and without error.

They conspired to use Daniel's faith against him by convincing Darius to issue a decree that anyone who prayed to any god or man other than the king for thirty days would be thrown into the lions' den. Darius signed the decree, which could not be altered according to the law of the Medes and Persians.

Despite knowing the decree, Daniel continued to pray to God three times a day. His enemies caught him praying and reported it to the king. Darius was distressed but could not change the decree. Daniel was thrown into the lions' den, but Darius expressed hope that Daniel's God would save him. The den was sealed with a stone and the king's signet.

Darius spent a sleepless night fasting and hurried to the den at dawn. He called out to Daniel, who replied that God had sent an angel to shut the lions' mouths because he was found innocent before God and the king.King Darius was overjoyed and ordered Daniel to be lifted out of the lions' den. Daniel was unharmed because he trusted in his God. The king then commanded that the men who had falsely accused Daniel, along with their families, be thrown into the lions' den, where they were immediately killed.

Darius issued a decree to all people and nations, declaring that everyone should respect the God of Daniel, who is the living God and whose kingdom will never be destroyed. He praised God for rescuing Daniel from the lions.

Daniel continued to prosper during the reigns of Darius and Cyrus the Persian.

In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream with visions. He saw four great beasts rising from the sea, each different from the others. The first was like a lion with eagle's wings, which were plucked off, and it stood like a man with a human heart. The second beast was like a bear, raised on one side with three ribs in its mouth, told to devour much flesh. The third beast was like a leopard with four wings and four heads, given dominion. The fourth beast was terrifying, with iron teeth and ten horns. A smaller horn with eyes and a mouth speaking great things emerged, uprooting three of the original horns.

Daniel saw thrones set up and the Ancient of Days, with white garments and hair like wool, sitting on a fiery throne. Thousands served Him, and the court was in session with books opened. The fourth beast was slain and its body destroyed. The other beasts lost their dominion but were allowed to live for a time.

Daniel saw one like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven to the Ancient of Days, receiving everlasting dominion and a kingdom that all people would serve.

Daniel was troubled by the visions and asked for their meaning. He was told that the four beasts represented four kings, but the saints of the Most High would eventually possess the kingdom forever. The fourth beast represented a kingdom that would devour the earth, with ten kings arising from it. Another king would rise, subduing three kings, speaking against the Most High, and oppressing the saints until judgment was passed in favor of the saints, who would then possess the kingdom.

In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, Daniel had another vision. He saw a ram with two horns, one higher than the other, pushing west, north, and south, unstoppable. Then a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, attacking and defeating the ram. The goat's horn was broken, replaced by four notable horns. From one of these horns, a smaller horn grew, becoming very powerful and challenging the host of heaven.

Daniel heard a conversation about how long the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and desolation would last, and was told it would be for 2,300 days, after which the sanctuary would be cleansed.

Gabriel appeared to Daniel, explaining that the vision referred to the end times. The ram represented the kings of Media and Persia, and the goat the king of Greece. The broken horn and the four that replaced it symbolized four kingdoms arising from Greece. A fierce king would arise in the latter time, powerful but not by his own power, causing great destruction and succeeding in his endeavors.In the first year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the Chaldean realm, I, Daniel, understood from the scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. So, I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with Him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.

I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed: "Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant of love with those who love Him and keep His commandments, we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from Your commands and laws. We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.

"Lord, You are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where You have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to You. We and our kings, our princes, and our ancestors are covered with shame, Lord, because we have sinned against You. The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against Him; we have not obeyed the Lord our God or kept the laws He gave us through His servants the prophets. All Israel has transgressed Your law and turned away, refusing to obey You.

"Therefore, the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us because we have sinned against You. You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven, nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to Your truth. The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the Lord our God is righteous in everything He does; yet we have not obeyed Him.

"Now, Lord our God, who brought Your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for Yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, turn away Your anger and Your wrath from Jerusalem, Your city, Your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and Your people an object of scorn to all those around us.

"Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of Your servant. For Your sake, Lord, look with favor on Your desolate sanctuary. Give ear, our God, and hear; open Your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears Your Name. We do not make requests of You because we are righteous, but because of Your great mercy. Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For Your sake, my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people bear Your Name."

While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the Lord my God for His holy hill—while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. He instructed me and said to me, "Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding. As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision:

"Seventy 'sevens' are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place. Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. He will confirm a covenant with many for one 'seven.' In the middle of the 'seven,' he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple, he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him."

In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. The understanding of the message came to him in a vision. At that time, I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.

On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude. I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves. So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless. Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.

A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. He said, "Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you." And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.

Then he continued, "Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come."

While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless. Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, "I am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I feel very weak. How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe."

Again, the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength. "Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed," he said. "Peace! Be strong now; be strong."

When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength."

So he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come; but first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince. And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him.)

"Now then, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases. After he has arisen, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others."The kingdom will be taken away and given to others. The king of the south will be strong, but one of his princes will be even stronger and will rule over a vast territory. After some years, the daughter of the king of the south will marry the king of the north to form an alliance, but it won't last. She, her attendants, and her father will be betrayed. However, a relative of hers will rise to power, lead an army, and defeat the king of the north, taking their gods and treasures back to Egypt.

The king of the south will return to his land, but his sons will prepare for war and gather a large army. One of them will invade and pass through, but the king of the south will retaliate with a great army. Despite initial success, he will not maintain his strength. The king of the north will return with an even larger army and wealth after several years. Many will rise against the king of the south, but they will fail.

The king of the north will capture fortified cities, and the forces of the south will not be able to resist. He will do as he pleases and will stand in the glorious land, consuming it. He will try to make an alliance by giving his daughter in marriage, but she will not support him. He will then turn his attention to the coastlands and conquer many, but a commander will put an end to his arrogance. He will return to his land but will stumble and fall.

A tax collector will rise in his place but will be destroyed in a short time. A despicable person will take over the kingdom through deceit and flattery. He will defeat powerful forces and break the prince of the covenant. He will act deceitfully, becoming strong with a small group of people. He will invade the richest parts of the province and distribute the spoils among his followers, planning his strategies against strongholds.

He will muster his strength and courage against the king of the south with a great army. The king of the south will also prepare for battle with a mighty army but will be betrayed by those who eat at his table. Both kings will plot against each other, but their plans will not succeed. The king of the north will return to his land with great wealth and will oppose the holy covenant.

At the appointed time, he will invade the south again, but this time it will not be as successful. Ships from the west will oppose him, and he will retreat in anger, turning against the holy covenant. He will favor those who abandon the covenant and will desecrate the temple, stopping the daily sacrifices and setting up the abomination that causes desolation.

Those who act wickedly against the covenant will be corrupted by flattery, but the people who know their God will stand firm and take action. The wise among the people will instruct many, but they will face persecution by sword, flame, captivity, and plunder for many days. When they fall, they will receive some help, but many will join them insincerely. Some of the wise will stumble, but this will refine and purify them until the end.

The king will do as he pleases, exalting and magnifying himself above every god and speaking against the God of gods. He will succeed until the time of wrath is completed. He will not regard the gods of his ancestors or the desire of women, but will honor a god of fortresses with gold, silver, precious stones, and costly gifts. He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will reward those who acknowledge him, making them rulers over many and distributing land for a price.

At the end time, the king of the south will engage him in battle, but the king of the north will respond with a whirlwind of chariots, horsemen, and many ships. He will invade many countries, including the glorious land, but Edom, Moab, and the leaders of Ammon will escape. He will extend his power over many countries, including Egypt, and will control its treasures. Libyans and Cushites will follow him.

News from the east and north will alarm him, and he will set out in great rage to destroy many. He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain, but he will meet his end with no one to help him.

At that time, Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress unlike any before, but your people will be delivered—everyone whose name is found written in the book. Many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life and others to shame and everlasting contempt. The wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever.

But you, Daniel, close up and seal the words of the scroll until the end of time. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.

Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing on opposite sides of the river. One asked the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters, "How long until these astonishing things are fulfilled?" The man raised both hands toward heaven and swore by the one who lives forever, saying, "It will be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed."

I heard but did not understand, so I asked, "My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?" He replied, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. Many will be purified, made spotless, and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand.

From the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days. As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days, you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."

The word of the LORD that came to Hosea, son of Beeri, during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.In the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel, the word of the LORD came to Hosea. The LORD told Hosea to marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her because the land was guilty of unfaithfulness to the LORD. So Hosea married Gomer, daughter of Diblaim, and she bore him a son. The LORD instructed Hosea to name the boy Jezreel, as He would soon punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel and end the kingdom of Israel. 

Gomer conceived again and had a daughter. The LORD told Hosea to name her Lo-Ruhamah, meaning "not loved," as He would no longer show love to Israel but would show love to Judah and save them not by war but by the LORD their God. After weaning Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. The LORD said to name him Lo-Ammi, meaning "not my people," because Israel was no longer His people, and He was no longer their God.

Despite this, the Israelites would be as numerous as the sand on the seashore, and in the place where they were called "not my people," they would be called "children of the living God." The people of Judah and Israel would reunite under one leader and come out of exile, for great would be the day of Jezreel.

The LORD then instructed Hosea to tell his people to plead with their mother, Israel, to abandon her promiscuity and idolatry, or He would strip her bare and make her like a desert. He would not show love to her children, for they were conceived in disgrace. Their mother had been unfaithful, chasing after lovers who provided her with food and clothing. The LORD would block her path with thorns and walls so she could not find her way. She would chase her lovers but not catch them, and then she would return to her first husband, realizing it was better with him.

The LORD would take back His grain and wine, and expose her lewdness before her lovers. He would stop her celebrations, destroy her vines and fig trees, and punish her for worshiping Baal. However, He would allure her, lead her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her. He would give her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. She would respond as in her youth, as when she came out of Egypt.

On that day, she would call the LORD "my husband" and no longer "my master." The LORD would remove the names of Baal from her lips and make a covenant with the animals, birds, and creatures of the earth. He would abolish war and make her lie down in safety. He would betroth her to Him forever in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion. She would know the LORD.

The LORD would respond to the heavens, and they would respond to the earth, which would respond to the grain, wine, and oil, and they would respond to Jezreel. He would plant her for Himself in the land, show love to the one called "not loved," and say to those called "not my people," "You are my people," and they would say, "You are my God."

The LORD then told Hosea to love a woman loved by another man and an adulteress, symbolizing the LORD's love for Israel despite their idolatry. Hosea bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and some barley and told her to live with him for many days without being unfaithful. Israel would live many days without a king or sacrifices but would return and seek the LORD and David their king in the last days.

The LORD had a charge against Israel because there was no faithfulness, love, or acknowledgment of God in the land. There was only cursing, lying, murder, theft, and adultery, causing the land to mourn and its inhabitants to waste away. The priests and prophets would stumble, and the LORD would destroy their mother. The people were destroyed for lack of knowledge, and because they rejected knowledge, the LORD would reject them as priests. As they increased, they sinned more, so the LORD would turn their glory into shame. They fed on the sins of the people and relished their wickedness, so the LORD would punish them and repay them for their deeds. They would eat but not be satisfied, engage in promiscuity but not increase, because they had forsaken the LORD.

The people consulted wooden idols and divining rods, leading them astray. They sacrificed on mountaintops and hills, under trees where the shade was pleasant, causing their daughters and daughters-in-law to be unfaithful. The LORD would not punish the daughters for their promiscuity or the daughters-in-law for adultery because the men themselves consorted with harlots and shrine prostitutes. The people without understanding would come to ruin.

Though Israel was unfaithful, Judah should not follow suit. They should not go to Gilgal or Beth Aven or swear by the LORD's name. Israel was stubborn like a stubborn heifer, so the LORD would feed them like lambs in a meadow. Ephraim was joined to idols, so the LORD would leave them alone. Their drunkenness and promiscuity would lead to shame, and they would be swept away by the wind, ashamed of their sacrifices.

The LORD called the priests, the house of Israel, and the royal house to hear His judgment because they had been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread on Tabor. The rebels were deep in slaughter, but the LORD would discipline them all. He knew Ephraim and Israel's sins, and they could not hide from Him. Ephraim had turned to prostitution, and Israel was defiled. Their deeds did not permit them to return to their God because a spirit of prostitution was in their hearts, and they did not acknowledge the LORD. Israel's arrogance testified against them, and they stumbled in their sin, along with Judah. They would seek the LORD with their flocks and herds but not find Him because He had withdrawn from them. They were unfaithful to the LORD, and their children were illegitimate. Now their New Moon festivals would devour them and their fields.God will pour out His wrath like water. Ephraim is oppressed and broken because he followed false commands. God will be like a moth to Ephraim and like decay to Judah. When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah saw his wound, they turned to Assyria and King Jareb for help, but they couldn't heal them. God will be like a lion to Ephraim and Judah, tearing them apart with no one to rescue them. He will return to His place until they acknowledge their guilt and seek Him in their distress.

"Come, let us return to the Lord. He has torn us, but He will heal us; He has injured us, but He will bind up our wounds. After two days, He will revive us; on the third day, He will restore us, so we may live in His presence. Let us acknowledge the Lord; as surely as the sun rises, He will appear. He will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth."

God questions what to do with Ephraim and Judah, as their love is like the morning mist that quickly disappears. He has sent prophets to cut them down and spoken His judgments, which shine like light. God desires mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of Him rather than burnt offerings. But they have broken the covenant and acted deceitfully. Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with blood. Priests are like bands of robbers, committing murder and lewdness. God has seen horrible things in Israel: Ephraim's prostitution and Israel's defilement. Judah, too, will face a harvest of judgment when God restores His people.

When God wanted to heal Israel, Ephraim's sins and Samaria's wickedness were exposed. They practice deceit, thieves break in, and bandits rob outside. They don't realize that God remembers all their evil deeds, which surround them and are always before Him. They delight their king with their wickedness and their princes with their lies. They are all adulterers, burning with lust like an oven heated by a baker. On the day of the king's festival, the princes become inflamed with wine, and the king joins hands with mockers. Their hearts are like an oven, smoldering all night and blazing in the morning. They devour their rulers, and all their kings fall, yet none of them calls on God.

Ephraim mixes with other nations and is like a flatbread not turned over. Foreigners sap his strength, but he doesn't realize it. His hair is sprinkled with gray, but he doesn't notice. Israel's arrogance testifies against him, yet they do not return to the Lord or seek Him. Ephraim is like a dove, easily deceived and senseless, calling to Egypt and turning to Assyria. When they go, God will spread His net over them and bring them down like birds. He will punish them as He has warned. Woe to them for fleeing from God! Destruction awaits them for rebelling against Him. Though He redeemed them, they speak lies against Him. They do not cry out to Him from their hearts but wail on their beds. They gather for grain and new wine but turn away from God. Though He trained and strengthened them, they plot evil against Him. They turn, but not to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words, and they will be ridiculed in Egypt.

"Sound the trumpet! An enemy swoops down on the Lord's house because they have broken His covenant and rebelled against His law. Israel cries out, 'Our God, we acknowledge you!' But Israel has rejected what is good, and an enemy will pursue him. They set up kings without God's consent and choose princes without His approval. With their silver and gold, they make idols for themselves to their own destruction. Samaria, your calf-idol has cast you off; God's anger burns against you. How long will you be incapable of purity? This idol is from Israel; a craftsman made it; it is not God. It will be broken to pieces.

They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will produce no flour. Even if it yields grain, foreigners will swallow it up. Israel is swallowed up; now they are among the nations like something no one wants. They have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers. Though they have sold themselves among the nations, God will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king. Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, but these have become altars for sinning. God wrote for them the many things of His law, but they regarded them as something foreign. They offer sacrifices given to God and eat the meat, but the Lord is not pleased with them. He will remember their wickedness and punish their sins. They will return to Egypt. Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has fortified many towns. But God will send fire on their cities that will consume their fortresses.

Israel, do not rejoice like other nations, for you have been unfaithful to your God. You love the wages of a prostitute at every threshing floor. The threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people; the new wine will fail them. They will not remain in the Lord's land; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria. They will not pour out wine offerings to the Lord, nor will their sacrifices please Him. Their sacrifices will be like the bread of mourners; all who eat them will be unclean. This food will be for themselves; it will not come into the house of the Lord. What will you do on the day of your appointed festivals, on the feast days of the Lord? Even if they escape from destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers, and thorns will overrun their tents. The days of punishment are coming, the days of reckoning are at hand. Let Israel know this. Because your sins are so many and your hostility so great, the prophet is considered a fool, the inspired person a maniac. The prophet, along with my God, is the watchman over Ephraim, yet snares await him on all his paths, and hostility in the house of his God. They have sunk deep into corruption, as in the days of Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins.

God found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; He saw their ancestors like the first fruit on the fig tree. But when they came to Baal Peor, they consecrated themselves to that shameful idol and became as vile as the thing they loved. Ephraim's glory will fly away like a bird—no birth, no pregnancy, no conception. Even if they rear children, God will bereave them of every one. Woe to them when He turns away from them! God has seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim will bring out their children to the slayer. Give them, Lord—what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry.

Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, God hated them there. Because of their sinful deeds, He will drive them out of His house. He will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious. Ephraim is blighted, their root is withered, they yield no fruit. Even if they bear children, God will slay their cherished offspring. God will reject them because they have not obeyed Him; they will be wanderers among the nations.

Israel is a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones. Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt. The Lord will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones. Then they will say, 'We have no king because we did not revere the Lord. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?' They make many promises, take false oaths, and make agreements; therefore, lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor because it is taken from them into exile. It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances. Samaria's king will be destroyed, swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters. The high places of wickedness will be destroyed—it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, 'Cover us!' and to the hills, 'Fall on us!'The people of Israel have turned away from God, creating idols and relying on their own strength. God is displeased and will punish them for their sins. Ephraim, a region in Israel, is compared to a trained heifer that loves to thresh grain, but God will put a yoke on her fair neck and make her work hard. Judah and Jacob will also face consequences. God urges them to sow righteousness and reap mercy, to break up their hard hearts and seek Him until He showers righteousness upon them. However, they have sown wickedness and reaped injustice, trusting in their own strength and many warriors. As a result, chaos will arise among them, and their fortresses will be destroyed, just as Shalman destroyed Betharbel in battle. The king of Israel will be completely cut off because of their great wickedness.

When Israel was young, God loved him and called him out of Egypt. But as they were called, they turned away, sacrificing to idols and burning incense to graven images. God taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms, but they did not realize He was the one who healed them. He led them with kindness and love, lifting the yoke from their necks and feeding them. Despite this, they will not return to Egypt, but Assyria will be their king because they refused to return to God. The sword will rage against their cities, consuming their branches and devouring them because of their own plans. The people are determined to turn away from God, and even though they call to the Most High, none truly honor Him.

God's heart is torn within Him, and His compassion is stirred. He will not carry out His fierce anger or destroy Ephraim again, for He is God, not a man. He is the Holy One among them and will not come in wrath. They will follow the Lord, and He will roar like a lion, causing His children to come trembling from the west. They will come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from Assyria, and God will settle them in their homes.

Ephraim surrounds God with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One. Ephraim feeds on the wind and chases the east wind, increasing lies and desolation daily. They make a covenant with Assyria and send oil to Egypt. The Lord has a dispute with Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways, repaying him for his deeds. Jacob struggled with God and prevailed, weeping and pleading for His favor. He found God at Bethel, and there God spoke with us. The Lord God Almighty, the Lord is His name. Therefore, return to your God, maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always.

Ephraim is a merchant with dishonest scales, who loves to oppress. Ephraim boasts of his wealth and claims that no sin can be found in him. But God, who brought them out of Egypt, will make them live in tents again, as in the days of the appointed festivals. God has spoken through the prophets, given many visions, and used parables. There is iniquity in Gilead, and their altars are like piles of stones in the fields. Jacob fled to Aram, served for a wife, and tended sheep for a wife. By a prophet, the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet, He cared for them. But Ephraim has bitterly provoked God to anger, and his blood guilt will remain on him. The Lord will repay him for his contempt.

When Ephraim spoke with trembling, he was exalted in Israel. But he became guilty of Baal worship and died. Now they continue to sin, making idols from their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. They say of these idols, "Sacrifice to them!" and people kiss the calf-idols. Therefore, they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, or like smoke escaping through a window. Yet God has been their Lord since Egypt, and they should acknowledge no God but Him, for there is no Savior besides Him. He cared for them in the wilderness, in the land of drought. When they were satisfied, they became proud and forgot Him. So, God will be like a lion to them, like a leopard lurking by the path. He will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs, tear open their chests, and devour them like a lion. The wild animals will rip them apart.

Israel has destroyed itself, but in God is their help. He will be their king; where is any other who can save them in all their cities? They asked for a king and princes, and God gave them a king in His anger and took him away in His wrath. Ephraim's guilt is stored up, his sins are kept on record. Pains like those of a woman in childbirth come to him, but he is a foolish son; when the time comes, he does not come to the opening of the womb. God will ransom them from the power of the grave and redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, is your destruction? Compassion is hidden from God's eyes. Even though Ephraim thrives among his brothers, an east wind from the Lord will come, blowing in from the desert. His spring will fail, and his well will dry up. His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures. The people of Samaria must bear their guilt because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword, their infants will be dashed to the ground, and their pregnant women ripped open.

Return, Israel, to the Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall. Take words with you and return to the Lord. Say to Him: "Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips. Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhorses. We will never again say 'Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in You the fatherless find compassion." God will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for His anger has turned away from them. He will be like the dew to Israel; they will blossom like a lily, like a cedar of Lebanon they will send down their roots. Their young shoots will grow, their splendor will be like an olive tree, their fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon. People will dwell again in His shade; they will flourish like the grain, they will blossom like the vine—Israel's fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim will say, "What more have I to do with idols?" God will answer and care for him. He will be like a flourishing juniper; their fruitfulness comes from Him. Who is wise? Let them realize these things. Who is discerning? Let them understand. The ways of the Lord are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.The mighty day is near. The food supply is cut off before our eyes, and joy and gladness have left the house of our God. The seeds are rotting under the soil, the storehouses are desolate, and the barns are broken down because the crops have withered. The animals groan, and the herds of cattle are confused because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering. 

O LORD, I cry out to You because fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flames have burned all the trees in the field. The animals of the field also cry out to You because the streams of water have dried up, and fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness.

Blow the trumpet in Zion, sound the alarm on my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming; it is near. It will be a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness. Like dawn spreading across the mountains, a large and mighty army comes, unlike any seen before and never to be seen again for generations. 

Before them, fire devours; behind them, flames burn. The land before them is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them, it is a desolate wilderness; nothing escapes them. They look like horses and charge like cavalry. With a noise like that of chariots, they leap over the mountaintops, like a crackling fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army drawn up for battle. 

Before them, the people are in anguish; every face turns pale. They charge like warriors; they scale walls like soldiers. They all march in line, not swerving from their course. They do not jostle each other; each marches straight ahead. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks. They rush upon the city, run along the wall, climb into the houses, and enter through the windows like thieves. 

The earth quakes before them, the heavens tremble, the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars no longer shine. The LORD thunders at the head of His army; His forces are beyond number, and mighty is the army that obeys His command. The day of the LORD is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it?

"Even now," declares the LORD, "return to Me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning. Tear your hearts and not just your clothes. Return to the LORD your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and He relents from sending calamity. Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing—grain offerings and drink offerings for the LORD your God."

Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly. Gather the people, consecrate the assembly; bring together the elders, gather the children, even those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber. Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the portico and the altar. Let them say, "Spare Your people, LORD. Do not make Your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"

Then the LORD was jealous for His land and took pity on His people. The LORD replied to them: "I am sending you grain, new wine, and olive oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations. I will drive the northern horde far from you, pushing it into a parched and barren land; its eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea. And its stench will go up; its smell will rise."

Surely He has done great things. Do not be afraid, land of Judah; be glad and rejoice. Surely the LORD has done great things! Do not be afraid, you wild animals, for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green. The trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches. Be glad, people of Zion, rejoice in the LORD your God, for He has given you the autumn rains because He is faithful. He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before. The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.

"I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten—the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm—My great army that I sent among you. You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will My people be shamed. Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the LORD your God, and that there is no other; never again will My people be shamed."

"And afterward, I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. Even on My servants, both men and women, I will pour out My Spirit in those days. I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD. And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, even among the survivors whom the LORD calls."

"In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will put them on trial for what they did to My inheritance, My people Israel, because they scattered My people among the nations and divided up My land. They cast lots for My people and traded boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for wine to drink."

"Now what have you against Me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying Me for something I have done? If you are paying Me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done. For you took My silver and My gold and carried off My finest treasures to your temples. You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland."

"See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done. I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away." The LORD has spoken.

Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack. Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say, "I am strong!" Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down Your warriors, LORD!

"Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side. Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow—so great is their wickedness!"

Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine. The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for His people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.

"Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, My holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her. In that day the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the LORD's house and will water the valley of acacias. But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood. Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations. Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not." The LORD dwells in Zion.

The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa—the vision he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel. He said:

"The LORD roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds dry up, and the top of Carmel withers."

This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not relent. Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth, I will send fire on the house of Hazael that will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad. I will break down the gate of Damascus; I will destroy the king who is in the Valley of Aven and the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden. The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir," says the LORD.

This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not relent. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom, I will send fire on the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses. I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn My hand against Ekron till the last of the Philistines are dead," says the Sovereign LORD.They took entire communities captive to deliver them to Edom. Because of this, I will send fire on the walls of Gaza, destroying its palaces. I will cut off the inhabitants of Ashdod and the rulers of Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron until the last of the Philistines perish," says the Lord God.

The Lord says, "For the sins of Tyre, I will not relent. They delivered entire communities to Edom and forgot their brotherly covenant. I will send fire on the walls of Tyre, consuming its palaces. For the sins of Edom, I will not relent. They pursued their brother with the sword, showing no pity, and their anger raged continually. I will send fire upon Teman, consuming the palaces of Bozrah. For the sins of the Ammonites, I will not relent. They ripped open pregnant women in Gilead to expand their territory. I will kindle a fire in the walls of Rabbah, consuming its palaces amid battle cries and storms. Their king and princes will go into captivity together," says the Lord.

The Lord says, "For the sins of Moab, I will not relent. They burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime. I will send fire upon Moab, consuming the palaces of Kerioth. Moab will die amid tumult, shouting, and the sound of the trumpet. I will cut off their judge and slay all their princes," says the Lord.

The Lord says, "For the sins of Judah, I will not relent. They despised the law of the Lord and did not keep His commandments. Their lies led them astray, following the same paths as their ancestors. I will send fire upon Judah, consuming the palaces of Jerusalem. For the sins of Israel, I will not relent. They sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals. They trample the heads of the poor and deny justice to the oppressed. Father and son use the same girl, profaning my holy name. They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge and drink wine in the house of their god.

Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them, whose height was like the cedars and strength like the oaks. I destroyed their fruit above and roots below. I brought you up from Egypt and led you through the wilderness for forty years to possess the land of the Amorites. I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazarites from your young men. Is this not true, people of Israel?" declares the Lord. "But you made the Nazarites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy. I am weighed down by you as a cart is weighed down by sheaves. The swift will not escape, the strong will not muster their strength, and the warrior will not save his life. The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet-footed soldier will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life. Even the bravest warriors will flee naked on that day," declares the Lord.

Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the Lord has spoken against you, against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt: "You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore, I will punish you for all your sins. Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so? Does a lion roar in the thicket when it has no prey? Does it growl in its den when it has caught nothing? Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground when no bait is there? Does a trap spring up from the ground if it has caught nothing? When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the Lord caused it? Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets. The lion has roared—who will not fear? The Sovereign Lord has spoken—who can but prophesy?

Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: 'Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people.' They do not know how to do right," declares the Lord, "who store up in their fortresses what they have plundered and looted." Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: "An enemy will overrun your land, pull down your strongholds, and plunder your fortresses." This is what the Lord says: "As a shepherd rescues from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, with only the corner of a bed and a piece of fabric from a couch." Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob," declares the Lord, the Lord God Almighty. "On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed, and the mansions will be demolished," declares the Lord.

Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands, 'Bring us some drinks!' The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his holiness: 'The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks. You will each go straight out through breaches in the wall, and you will be cast out toward Harmon,'" declares the Lord. "Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more. Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three years. Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings—boast about them, you Israelites, for this is what you love to do," declares the Sovereign Lord.

"I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord. "I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up. People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord. "Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, destroying them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord. "I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord. "I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord. "Therefore, this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God." He who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn to darkness and treads on the heights of the earth—the Lord God Almighty is his name.

Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you: "Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again, deserted in her own land, with no one to lift her up." This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel: "Your city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left; your town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left." This is what the Lord says to Israel: "Seek me and live; do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not journey to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will be reduced to nothing." Seek the Lord and live, or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire; it will devour them, and Bethel will have no one to quench it. There are those who turn justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground. He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns midnight into dawn and darkens day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land—the Lord is his name. With a blinding flash, he destroys the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin.They take bribes and deny justice to the poor at the city gates. Therefore, the wise will keep silent at such times, for these are evil times. Seek good, not evil, so you may live, and the Lord, the God of hosts, will be with you as you claim. Hate evil, love good, and establish justice at the city gates. Perhaps the Lord, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.

Therefore, the Lord, the God of hosts, says this: "There will be wailing in all the streets and cries of 'Alas! Alas!' in the highways. Farmers will be called to mourn, and professional mourners to wail. There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst," says the Lord.

Woe to those who long for the day of the Lord! What will that day be for you? It will be darkness, not light. It will be as if someone fled from a lion only to meet a bear, or entered their house and rested their hand on the wall only to be bitten by a snake. Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light—pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness?

"I hate, I despise your religious festivals; I cannot stand your assemblies. Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Though you bring choice fellowship offerings, I will have no regard for them. Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!

"Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel? You have lifted up the shrine of your king, the pedestal of your idols, the star of your god—which you made for yourselves. Therefore, I will send you into exile beyond Damascus," says the Lord, whose name is God Almighty.

Woe to you who are complacent in Zion, and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria, you notable men of the foremost nation, to whom the people of Israel come! Go to Kalneh and look at it; go from there to great Hamath, and then go down to Gath in Philistia. Are they better off than your two kingdoms? Is their land larger than yours? You put off the day of disaster and bring near a reign of terror. You lie on beds adorned with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves. You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments. You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. Therefore, you will be among the first to go into exile; your feasting and lounging will end.

The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himself—the Lord God Almighty declares: "I abhor the pride of Jacob and detest his fortresses; I will deliver up the city and everything in it." If ten people are left in one house, they too will die. And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them asks anyone who might be hiding there, 'Is anyone else with you?' and he says, 'No,' then he will go on to say, 'Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.'

For the Lord has given the command, and he will smash the great house into pieces and the small house into bits. Do horses run on the rocky crags? Does one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness—you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar and say, 'Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?' For the Lord God Almighty declares, 'I will stir up a nation against you, Israel, that will oppress you all the way from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.'"

This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king's share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up. When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, "Sovereign Lord, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!" So the Lord relented. "This will not happen," the Lord said.

This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: The Sovereign Lord was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land. Then I cried out, "Sovereign Lord, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!" So the Lord relented. "This will not happen either," the Sovereign Lord said.

This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand. And the Lord asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" "A plumb line," I replied. Then the Lord said, "Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam."

Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: "Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. For this is what Amos is saying: 'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'"

Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king's sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom."

Amos answered Amaziah, "I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. But the Lord took me from tending the flock and said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.' Now then, hear the word of the Lord. You say, 'Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.' Therefore this is what the Lord says: 'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan country. And Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'"

This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: a basket of ripe fruit. "What do you see, Amos?" he asked. "A basket of ripe fruit," I answered. Then the Lord said to me, "The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. In that day," declares the Sovereign Lord, "the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. Many, many bodies—flung everywhere! Silence!"

Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land, saying, "When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?"—skimping on the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat. The Lord has sworn by himself, the Pride of Jacob: "I will never forget anything they have done."

Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt. "In that day," declares the Sovereign Lord, "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight. I will turn your religious festivals into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.

"The days are coming," declares the Sovereign Lord, "when I will send a famine through the land—not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord. People will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the Lord, but they will not find it.

"In that day the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst. Those who swear by the sin of Samaria—who say, 'As surely as your god lives, Dan,' or, 'As surely as the god of Beersheba lives'—they will fall, never to rise again."

I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said: "Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword. Not one will get away, none will escape. Though they dig down to the depths below, from there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to the heavens above, from there I will bring them down. Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them. Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them. I will keep my eye on them for harm and not for good."

The Lord, the Lord Almighty—he touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn; the whole land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt; he builds his lofty palace in the heavens and sets its foundation on the earth; he calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land—the Lord is his name.

"Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites?" declares the Lord. "Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?The Lord's eyes are on the sinful kingdom, and He will destroy it from the face of the earth, but He will not completely destroy the house of Jacob. He will sift Israel among all nations, like grain in a sieve, but not a single kernel will fall to the ground. All the sinners among His people who say, "Disaster will not overtake us," will die by the sword.

In that day, He will restore the fallen shelter of David, repair its broken walls, and rebuild it as it was in the past. They will possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear His name. The days are coming when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman and the planter by the one treading grapes. New wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills. He will bring back His exiled people Israel; they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine, make gardens, and eat their fruit. He will plant them in their own land, never again to be uprooted.

Obadiah's vision concerning Edom: The Lord says, "We have heard a message from the Lord, and an envoy has been sent to the nations to say, 'Rise, let us go against her for battle.' I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised. The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights. You say to yourself, 'Who can bring me down to the ground?' Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down."

If thieves came to you, would they not steal only as much as they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes? But how Esau will be ransacked, his hidden treasures pillaged! All your allies will force you to the border; your friends will deceive and overpower you. Those who eat your bread will set a trap for you, but you will not detect it. On that day, the Lord will destroy the wise men of Edom and the understanding from the mountains of Esau. Your warriors will be terrified, and everyone in Esau's mountains will be cut down in the slaughter because of the violence against your brother Jacob.

You stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates. You should not gloat over your brother in the day of his misfortune or rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction. You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster or seize their wealth. You should not wait at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives or hand over their survivors in the day of their trouble.

The day of the Lord is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head. Just as you drank on my holy hill, so all the nations will drink continually; they will drink and drink and be as if they had never been. But on Mount Zion will be deliverance; it will be holy, and Jacob will possess his inheritance. Jacob will be a fire and Joseph a flame; Esau will be stubble, and they will set him on fire and destroy him. There will be no survivors from Esau.

People from the Negev will occupy the mountains of Esau, and people from the foothills will possess the land of the Philistines. They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead. The exiles of Israel will possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath, and the exiles from Jerusalem will possess the towns of the Negev. Deliverers will go up on Mount Zion to govern the mountains of Esau, and the kingdom will be the Lord's.

The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amittai: "Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me." But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, found a ship bound for that port, paid the fare, and went aboard to flee from the Lord. The Lord sent a great wind on the sea, and a violent storm arose that threatened to break up the ship. The sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. They threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship, but Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.

The captain went to him and said, "How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish." The sailors said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity." They cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. So they asked him, "Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What kind of work do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?"

He answered, "I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land." This terrified them, and they asked, "What have you done?" They knew he was running away from the Lord because he had already told them so. The sea was getting rougher and rougher, so they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?"

"Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied, "and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you." Instead, the men did their best to row back to land, but they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before. Then they cried out to the Lord, "Please, Lord, do not let us die for taking this man's life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, Lord, have done as you pleased." Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm. At this, the men greatly feared the Lord, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to Him.

Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. He said, "In my distress, I called to the Lord, and He answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead, I called for help, and you listened to my cry. You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me. I said, 'I have been banished from your sight, yet I will look again toward your holy temple.' The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. To the roots of the mountains, I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit. When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple. Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God's love for them. But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed, I will make good. I will say, 'Salvation comes from the Lord.'"

And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time: "Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you." Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it. Jonah began by going a day's journey into the city, proclaiming, "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown." The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. When Jonah's warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat down in the dust. He issued a proclamation in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence."The people of Nineveh repented and turned from their evil ways, hoping that God would change His mind and spare them from destruction. God saw their genuine repentance and decided not to bring the disaster He had threatened. However, Jonah was very upset and angry about this. He prayed to the Lord, saying, "Didn't I say this would happen when I was still at home? That's why I tried to run away to Tarshish. I knew you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, who relents from sending calamity. Now, Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live." 

The Lord replied, "Is it right for you to be angry?" Jonah then went out and sat down at a place east of the city. He made himself a shelter, sat in its shade, and waited to see what would happen to the city. The Lord God provided a leafy plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head and ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant. But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered. When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die and said, "It would be better for me to die than to live."

But God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?" Jonah replied, "It is, and I'm so angry I wish I were dead." But the Lord said, "You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight. And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?"

The word of the Lord came to Micah during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He saw visions concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. "Listen, all you peoples; pay attention, earth and all who live in it, that the Sovereign Lord may bear witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. Look! The Lord is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth. The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope. All this is because of Jacob's transgression, because of the sins of the people of Israel. What is Jacob's transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah's high place? Is it not Jerusalem?

Therefore, I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations. All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used."

Because of this, I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl. For Samaria's plague is incurable; it has spread to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself. Tell it not in Gath; weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah roll in the dust. Pass by naked and in shame, you who live in Shaphir. Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; it no longer protects you. Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the Lord, even to the gate of Jerusalem. You who live in Lachish, harness fast horses to the chariot. You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you. Therefore, you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Akzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel. I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. The nobles of Israel will flee to Adullam. Shave your heads in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourselves as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile.

Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light, they carry it out because it is in their power to do it. They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance. Therefore, the Lord says: "I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity. In that day people will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: 'We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.' Therefore, you will have no one in the assembly of the Lord to divide the land by lot.

"Do not prophesy," their prophets say. "Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us." You descendants of Jacob, should it be said, "Does the Lord become impatient? Does he do such things?" Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright? Lately, my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle. You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever. Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy. If a liar and deceiver comes and says, 'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' that would be just the prophet for this people!

"I will surely gather all of you, Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people. The One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their King will pass through before them, the Lord at their head."

Then I said, "Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel. Should you not embrace justice, you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones; who eat my people's flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?" Then they will cry out to the Lord, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.

This is what the Lord says: "As for the prophets who lead my people astray, they proclaim 'peace' if they have something to eat, but prepare to wage war against anyone who refuses to feed them. Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them. The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God." But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.

Hear this, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right; who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness. Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they look for the Lord's support and say, "Is not the Lord among us? No disaster will come upon us." Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.

In the last days, the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many nations will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the Lord Almighty has spoken. All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.

"In that day," declares the Lord, "I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief. I will make the lame my remnant, those driven away a strong nation. The Lord will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever. As for you, watchtower of the flock, stronghold of Daughter Zion, the former dominion will be restored to you; kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem.""Why do you cry out loud? Is there no king among you? Has your counselor perished, that you are seized with pain like a woman in labor? Be in pain and labor to give birth, Daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor. For now, you will leave the city and live in the field, and you will go to Babylon. There you will be rescued; there the Lord will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

Now many nations are gathered against you, saying, 'Let her be defiled, and let our eyes gloat over Zion.' But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor. Rise and thresh, Daughter of Zion, for I will give you horns of iron and hooves of bronze, and you will crush many nations. You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the Lord, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.

Now gather your troops, Daughter of Troops; a siege is laid against us. They will strike Israel's ruler on the cheek with a rod. But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. Therefore, Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor bears a son, and the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites. He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth. And he will be our peace when the Assyrians invade our land and march through our fortresses. We will raise against them seven shepherds, even eight commanders, who will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with drawn sword. He will deliver us from the Assyrians when they invade our land and march across our borders.

The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the Lord, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or depend on man. The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which mauls and mangles as it goes, and no one can rescue. Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, and all your foes will be destroyed.

In that day, declares the Lord, I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots. I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds. I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells. I will destroy your idols and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands. I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles when I demolish your cities. I will take vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that have not obeyed me.

Listen to what the Lord says: 'Stand up, plead my case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say. Hear, you mountains, the Lord's accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the Lord has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel. My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me. I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam. My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.'

With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.

Listen! The Lord is calling to the city—and to fear your name is wisdom—'Heed the rod and the One who appointed it. Am I still to forget your ill-gotten treasures, you wicked house, and the short ephah, which is accursed? Shall I acquit someone with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights? Your rich people are violent; your inhabitants are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully. Therefore, I have begun to destroy you, to ruin you because of your sins. You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. You will store up but save nothing, because what you save I will give to the sword. You will plant but not harvest; you will press olives but not use the oil, you will crush grapes but not drink the wine. You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house; you have followed their traditions. Therefore, I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision; you will bear the scorn of the nations.'

What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave. The faithful have been swept from the land; not one upright person remains. Everyone lies in wait to shed blood; they hunt each other with nets. Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire—they all conspire together. The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day God visits you has come, the day your watchmen sound the alarm. Now is the time of your confusion. Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with the woman who lies in your embrace guard the words of your lips. For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a man's enemies are the members of his own household.

But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me. Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light. Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the Lord's wrath, until he pleads my case and upholds my cause. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness. Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, 'Where is the Lord your God?' My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets.

The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries. In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain. The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds. Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago. As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders.

Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths and their ears will become deaf. They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the Lord our God and will be afraid of you. Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. You will be faithful to Jacob and show love to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our ancestors in days long ago.

This is the message concerning Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and vents his wrath against his enemies. The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet. He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade. The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it. Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him. The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him, but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh; he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness. Whatever they plot against the Lord he will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time."While they are tangled like thorns and drunk like drunkards, they will be consumed like dry stubble. Someone has come from you who plots evil against the Lord, a wicked advisor. The Lord says, "Even though they are at peace and numerous, they will be cut down when I pass through. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more. Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away."

The Lord has given a command concerning you: "Your name will no longer be perpetuated. I will destroy the carved images and cast idols from the house of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile."

Look, on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.

The one who scatters has come up against you. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength. The Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines.

The shields of the soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of juniper are brandished. The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning.

Nineveh summons her picked troops, yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place. The river gates are thrown open, and the palace collapses. It is decreed that Nineveh be exiled and carried away. Her female slaves moan like doves and beat on their breasts.

Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away. "Stop! Stop!" they cry, but no one turns back. Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures! She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale.

Where now is the lions' den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear? The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey.

"I am against you," declares the Lord Almighty. "I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard."

Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims! The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots! Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses—all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.

"I am against you," declares the Lord Almighty. "I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame. I will pelt you with filth, I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle. All who see you will flee from you and say, 'Nineveh is in ruins—who will mourn for her?' Where can I find anyone to comfort you?"

Are you better than Thebes, situated on the Nile, with water around her? The river was her defense, the waters her wall. Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were among her allies. Yet she was taken captive and went into exile. Her infants were dashed to pieces at every street corner. Lots were cast for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains.

You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy. All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit; when they are shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the eater. Look at your troops—they are all weaklings. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed the bars of your gates.

Draw water for the siege, strengthen your defenses! Work the clay, tread the mortar, repair the brickwork! There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down—they will devour you like a swarm of locusts. Multiply like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts! You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more than the stars of the sky, but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away.

Your guards are like locusts, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day—but when the sun appears they fly away, and no one knows where. King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them. Nothing can heal you; your wound is fatal. All who hear the news about you clap their hands at your fall, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?

This is the message that the prophet Habakkuk received in a vision. How long, Lord, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, "Violence!" but you do not save? Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds. Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.

"Look at the nations and watch—and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told. I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own. They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor. Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like an eagle swooping to devour; they all come intent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand. They mock kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; by building earthen ramps they capture them. Then they sweep past like the wind and go on—guilty people, whose own strength is their god."

Lord, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, you will never die. You, Lord, have appointed them to execute judgment; you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish. Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves? You have made people like the fish in the sea, like the sea creatures that have no ruler. The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad. Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food. Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy?

I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint. Then the Lord replied: "Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it. For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay. See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright—but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness. Indeed, wine betrays him; he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples. Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, 'Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?' Will not your creditors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their prey. Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.""Woe to those who build a city with bloodshed and establish a town with injustice! Isn't it from the Lord of hosts that people labor for the fire and exhaust themselves for nothing? The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord's glory, as the waters cover the sea. Woe to those who give their neighbors drink, making them drunk to gaze on their nakedness! You are filled with shame instead of glory. Drink and expose your nakedness! The cup in the Lord's right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory. The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you because of your shedding of human blood and violence against the land, cities, and all who live in them.

What value is an idol carved by its maker, or a cast image that teaches lies? The maker trusts in his own creation to make worthless idols. Woe to those who say to wood, 'Come to life!' or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver, but there is no breath in it. But the Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.

This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. Lord, I have heard of your fame; I stand in awe of your deeds. Repeat them in our day, in our time make them known; in wrath remember mercy. God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens, and his praise filled the earth. His splendor was like the sunrise; rays flashed from his hand, where his power was hidden. Plague went before him; pestilence followed his steps. He stood and shook the earth; he looked and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains crumbled, and the age-old hills collapsed—but he marches on forever. I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, the dwellings of Midian in anguish.

Were you angry with the rivers, Lord? Was your wrath against the streams? Did you rage against the sea when you rode your horses and your chariots to victory? You uncovered your bow, you called for many arrows. You split the earth with rivers; the mountains saw you and writhed. Torrents of water swept by; the deep roared and lifted its waves on high. The sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your flashing spear. In wrath you strode through the earth and in anger you threshed the nations. You came out to deliver your people, to save your anointed one. You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness, you stripped him from head to foot. With his own spear you pierced his head when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding. You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.

I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound; decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us. Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior. The Sovereign Lord is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights.

This is the word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah during the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah: 'I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth,' declares the Lord. 'I will sweep away both man and beast; I will sweep away the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea, and the idols that cause the wicked to stumble.' When I destroy all mankind on the face of the earth,' declares the Lord, 'I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place, the very names of the idolatrous priests—those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host, those who bow down and swear by the Lord and who also swear by Molek, those who turn back from following the Lord and neither seek the Lord nor inquire of him.'

Be silent before the Sovereign Lord, for the day of the Lord is near. The Lord has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated those he has invited. On the day of the Lord's sacrifice, I will punish the officials and the king's sons and all those clad in foreign clothes. On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold, who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit. On that day,' declares the Lord, 'a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills. Wail, you who live in the market district; all your merchants will be wiped out, all who trade with silver will be destroyed. At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, "The Lord will do nothing, either good or bad." Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished. Though they build houses, they will not live in them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine.'

The great day of the Lord is near—near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the Lord is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry. That day will be a day of wrath—a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness, a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers. I will bring such distress on all people that they will grope about like those who are blind, because they have sinned against the Lord. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like dung. Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath.'

Gather together, gather yourselves, you shameful nation, before the decree takes effect and that day passes like windblown chaff, before the Lord's fierce anger comes upon you, before the day of the Lord's wrath comes upon you. Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lord's anger. Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted. Woe to you who live by the sea, you Kerethite people; the word of the Lord is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. He says, 'I will destroy you, and none will be left.' The land by the sea will become pastures having wells for shepherds and pens for flocks. That land will belong to the remnant of the people of Judah; there they will find pasture. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. The Lord their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes.

'I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land. Therefore, as surely as I live,' declares the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, 'surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah—a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.' This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the Lord Almighty. The Lord will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the earth. Distant nations will bow down to him, all of them in their own lands. 'You Cushites, too, will be slain by my sword.' He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert. Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their hooting will echo through the windows, rubble will fill the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed. This is the city of revelry that lived in safety. She said to herself, 'I am the one! And there is none besides me.' What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.

Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled! She obeys no one, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the Lord, she does not draw near to her God. Her officials within her are roaring lions; her rulers are evening wolves that leave nothing for the morning. Her prophets are unprincipled; they are treacherous people. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law."The Lord is just and always present; He does no wrong. Every morning, He brings His judgment to light without fail, but the unjust remain shameless. "I have cut off nations; their towers are desolate, their streets empty, and their cities destroyed with no inhabitants left. I thought, 'Surely they will fear me and accept correction,' so their homes wouldn't be destroyed despite my punishments. But they eagerly corrupted all their deeds. Therefore, wait for me," says the Lord, "until the day I rise to seize the prey. My decision is to gather the nations and assemble the kingdoms to pour out my indignation and fierce anger. The whole earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy. Then I will purify the speech of the peoples so that all may call upon the name of the Lord and serve Him together. From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my worshippers, the dispersed of my people, will bring offerings to me. On that day, you will not be ashamed of your past sins against me, for I will remove the proud and arrogant from among you, and you will no longer be haughty on my holy mountain. I will leave a humble and lowly people among you who will trust in the name of the Lord. The remnant of Israel will do no wrong, speak no lies, nor will deceit be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down, and no one will make them afraid. Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem! The Lord has taken away your punishment and turned back your enemy. The King of Israel, the Lord, is among you; never again will you fear any harm. On that day, they will say to Jerusalem, 'Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp. The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in His love, He will no longer rebuke you but will rejoice over you with singing.' I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you. At that time, I will deal with all who oppress you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame. At that time, I will gather you; at that time, I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes," says the Lord.

In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, son of Jozadak, the high priest: "This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'These people say, "The time has not yet come to rebuild the Lord's house."' Then the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: 'Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses while this house remains a ruin?' Now, this is what the Lord Almighty says: 'Give careful thought to your ways. You have planted much but harvested little. You eat but never have enough. You drink but never have your fill. You put on clothes but are not warm. You earn wages only to put them in a purse with holes in it.' This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'Give careful thought to your ways. Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,' says the Lord. 'You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?' declares the Lord Almighty. 'Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. Therefore, because of you, the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil, and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.' Then Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, Joshua, son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the message of the prophet Haggai because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord. Then Haggai, the Lord's messenger, gave this message of the Lord to the people: 'I am with you,' declares the Lord. So the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the Lord Almighty, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius.

In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: 'Speak to Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua, son of Jozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them, "Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing? But now be strong, Zerubbabel," declares the Lord. "Be strong, Joshua, son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land," declares the Lord, "and work. For I am with you," declares the Lord Almighty. "This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear." This is what the Lord Almighty says: "In a little while, I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory," says the Lord Almighty. "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine," declares the Lord Almighty. "The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house," says the Lord Almighty. "And in this place, I will grant peace," declares the Lord Almighty.'

On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai: 'This is what the Lord Almighty says: "Ask the priests what the law says: If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil, or other food, does it become consecrated?" The priests answered, "No." Then Haggai said, "If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?" "Yes," the priests replied, "it becomes defiled." Then Haggai said, "So it is with this people and this nation in my sight," declares the Lord. "Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled. Now give careful thought to this from this day on—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the Lord's temple. When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty. I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew, and hail, yet you did not return to me," declares the Lord. "From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid. Give careful thought: Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not borne fruit. From this day on, I will bless you." The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month: "Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother. On that day," declares the Lord Almighty, "I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel," declares the Lord, "and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you," declares the Lord Almighty.'

In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo: 'The Lord was very angry with your ancestors. Therefore, tell the people: This is what the Lord Almighty says: "Return to me," declares the Lord Almighty, "and I will return to you," says the Lord Almighty. "Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.' But they would not listen or pay attention to me," declares the Lord. "Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever? But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? Then they repented and said, 'The Lord Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.'" On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.Zechariah had a vision of a man among myrtle trees with red, speckled, and white horses behind him. Zechariah asked what they were, and the angel explained that these were sent by the Lord to patrol the earth. They reported that the earth was peaceful and at rest. The angel then asked the Lord how long He would withhold mercy from Jerusalem and Judah, which had faced His anger for seventy years. The Lord responded with comforting words, expressing His jealousy for Jerusalem and Zion and His displeasure with the nations that had added to their suffering. He declared that He had returned to Jerusalem with mercy and that His house would be rebuilt.

Zechariah then saw four horns, which the angel explained were the powers that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. He also saw four craftsmen who would terrify and overthrow these powers. Next, Zechariah saw a man with a measuring line, who said he was measuring Jerusalem. An angel told Zechariah that Jerusalem would be a city without walls due to its large population, and the Lord would be a protective wall of fire around it.

The Lord called for the people to flee from the north and return to Zion, promising to punish the nations that had harmed them. He assured them that He would dwell among them, and many nations would join them and become His people. The Lord would again choose Jerusalem and comfort Zion.

Zechariah then saw Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, with Satan accusing him. The Lord rebuked Satan and declared Joshua a brand plucked from the fire. Joshua's filthy garments were replaced with clean ones, symbolizing the removal of his sins. The Lord promised that if Joshua followed His ways, he would govern His house and have access to His presence. The Lord also spoke of bringing forth His servant, the Branch, and removing the iniquity of the land in one day.

Zechariah saw a golden lampstand with seven lamps and two olive trees beside it. The angel explained that this vision represented the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the Lord. Zerubbabel would complete the temple, and the people would rejoice. The two olive trees were identified as the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

Zechariah then saw a flying scroll, representing a curse that would enter the houses of thieves and liars, consuming them. He also saw a woman named Wickedness being cast into a basket and carried away to Shinar, where a house would be built for her.

Finally, Zechariah saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains, representing the four spirits of heaven going out to patrol the earth. The black horses went to the north, the white followed, and the dappled horses went to the south. The angel explained that these were the four spirits of heaven sent to patrol the earth."Those who went to the north have calmed my spirit there," said the Lord. Then the Lord instructed Zechariah to take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who had returned from Babylon. He was to go to the house of Josiah, son of Zephaniah, and make crowns to place on the head of Joshua, the high priest. The Lord declared that Joshua, known as 'The Branch,' would build the Lord's temple, bear its glory, and rule as both king and priest, bringing peace between the two roles. The crowns would serve as a memorial in the temple for Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen, son of Zephaniah. People from afar would come to help build the temple, proving that the Lord had sent Zechariah, provided they obeyed God's voice.

In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, Kislev. People from Bethel, including Sherezer and Regemmelech, came to seek the Lord's favor and asked the priests and prophets if they should continue mourning and fasting in the fifth month as they had done for many years. The Lord responded, questioning whether their fasting was truly for Him and reminding them of the messages delivered by earlier prophets when Jerusalem was prosperous. The Lord emphasized the importance of true justice, mercy, and compassion, urging them not to oppress widows, orphans, foreigners, or the poor, and not to plot evil against each other. However, the people had refused to listen, hardening their hearts, leading to God's great wrath and their eventual scattering among nations, leaving the land desolate.

The Lord then declared His jealousy and fierce love for Zion, promising to return to Jerusalem and dwell there, making it a city of truth and a holy mountain. He envisioned a future where elderly men and women would sit in the streets, and children would play joyfully. The Lord assured that He would save His people from the east and west, bringing them back to Jerusalem to live in truth and righteousness. He encouraged the people to be strong and rebuild the temple, promising prosperity and blessings, transforming their former curse into a blessing. The Lord urged them to speak truth, execute fair judgment, and avoid evil thoughts and false oaths, as these were things He hated.

The Lord announced that the fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months would become joyful and happy occasions, urging them to love truth and peace. He foretold that people from many cities and nations would come to seek the Lord in Jerusalem, and ten men from different languages would take hold of a Jew, saying, "We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."

The Lord's message continued, addressing the lands of Hadrach and Damascus, and the cities of Hamath, Tyre, and Sidon. Despite Tyre's wealth and fortifications, the Lord would bring her down, and other cities like Ashkelon, Gaza, and Ekron would fear and suffer. The Lord would remove the blood and abominations from the mouths of the Philistines, making them like a clan in Judah. The Lord would protect His house from invading armies, and no oppressor would pass through again.

Rejoice, daughter of Zion, for your King is coming, righteous and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey. He will bring peace to the nations, and His rule will extend from sea to sea. The Lord will free prisoners from the waterless pit and restore double to them. He will use Judah and Ephraim as His weapons against Greece, and the Lord will appear over them, defending them and giving them victory. The Lord will save His people, making them like jewels in a crown, shining in His land. How great is His goodness and beauty, bringing joy and prosperity to the people.

Ask the Lord for rain in the spring, and He will provide showers for everyone. The idols and false prophets have misled the people with lies and false dreams, but the Lord will guide and bless His people."The people sought comfort in vain, wandering like troubled sheep without a shepherd. The Lord's anger burned against the shepherds, and He punished the leaders. The Lord visited His flock, the house of Judah, and made them strong like a warhorse. From Judah came leaders, strong and victorious in battle because the Lord was with them, confusing their enemies.

The Lord promised to strengthen and save the houses of Judah and Joseph, bringing them back because of His mercy. They would be as if they had never been rejected, for the Lord would hear them. Ephraim would be like mighty warriors, their hearts rejoicing as if with wine, and their children would see and be glad. The Lord would gather and redeem them, increasing their numbers.

The Lord would bring them back from Egypt and Assyria to the lands of Gilead and Lebanon, where there would be no room for them. He would pass through the sea of trouble, striking the waves and drying up the river depths, humbling Assyria's pride and removing Egypt's power. The Lord would strengthen His people, and they would walk in His name.

The Lord called for Lebanon to open its doors so that fire could consume its cedars. The mighty trees would fall, and the shepherds would wail as their glory was destroyed. The Lord instructed to care for the flock destined for slaughter, whose owners felt no guilt and whose sellers praised their wealth. The Lord would no longer pity the land's inhabitants, delivering them into the hands of their neighbors and kings, who would strike the land.

The Lord took two staffs, named Beauty and Bands, to shepherd the flock. He dismissed three shepherds in one month, as they and He grew weary of each other. The Lord decided not to care for the dying or the perishing, letting them devour each other. He broke the staff called Beauty, ending His covenant with the people, which the poor of the flock recognized as the Lord's word.

The Lord asked for His price, and they weighed out thirty pieces of silver, which He threw to the potter in the house of the Lord. He then broke the staff called Bands, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The Lord instructed to take the tools of a foolish shepherd, who would not care for the lost, seek the young, heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but would instead devour the flock.

Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword would strike his arm and right eye, leaving his arm useless and his eye blind. The Lord declared a burden for Israel, stretching out the heavens, laying the earth's foundation, and forming the human spirit. He would make Jerusalem a cup of trembling for surrounding peoples and a burdensome stone for all nations, cutting to pieces those who tried to lift it.

The Lord would strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness, watching over Judah while blinding the enemy's horses. Judah's leaders would find strength in the Lord, and the Lord would make them like a fire among wood, consuming surrounding peoples. Jerusalem would be inhabited again, and the Lord would save Judah first, ensuring the house of David and Jerusalem's inhabitants did not boast over Judah.

The Lord would defend Jerusalem's inhabitants, making the weakest among them like David and the house of David like God. The Lord would seek to destroy all nations attacking Jerusalem, pouring out a spirit of grace and supplication on David's house and Jerusalem's inhabitants. They would mourn for the one they pierced, grieving deeply as for a firstborn son.

There would be great mourning in Jerusalem, with each family mourning separately. A fountain would be opened for David's house and Jerusalem's inhabitants to cleanse them from sin and impurity. The Lord would remove idols and false prophets from the land, and anyone prophesying lies would be condemned by their parents. The prophets would be ashamed of their visions and no longer wear deceptive garments, claiming instead to be simple farmers.

The Lord would strike the shepherd, scattering the sheep, but He would turn His hand to the little ones. Two-thirds of the land would be cut off and die, but the remaining third would be refined like silver and tested like gold. They would call on the Lord's name, and He would answer, declaring them His people, and they would acknowledge Him as their God.

The day of the Lord would come, with Jerusalem's spoil divided among them. The Lord would gather all nations against Jerusalem, leading to the city's capture, houses plundered, and women violated. Half the city would go into captivity, but the rest would remain. The Lord would fight against those nations as in past battles, standing on the Mount of Olives, which would split in two, creating a great valley. The people would flee through this valley, and the Lord would come with His holy ones.

On that day, there would be no clear light, but a unique day known only to the Lord, with no distinction between day and night.On that day, living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half toward the eastern sea and half toward the western sea, in both summer and winter. The Lord will be king over the whole earth, and there will be one Lord with one name. The land will be transformed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be elevated and inhabited from Benjamin's Gate to the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. People will live there, and there will be no more destruction; Jerusalem will be safe.

The Lord will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem with a plague that will cause their flesh to rot while they stand, their eyes to rot in their sockets, and their tongues to rot in their mouths. On that day, a great panic from the Lord will cause people to seize each other by the hand and fight against one another. Judah will also fight in Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered—gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance. The same plague will affect the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the animals in the enemy camps.

Everyone who survives from the nations that attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. Any family that does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, will have no rain. If the family of Egypt does not go up and participate, they will be struck with the same plague the Lord uses to punish the nations that do not celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. This will be the punishment for Egypt and all nations that do not go up to celebrate the feast.

On that day, the bells on the horses will be inscribed with "HOLINESS TO THE LORD," and the cooking pots in the Lord's house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar. Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord of hosts, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. On that day, there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts.

The Lord's message to Israel through Malachi begins with the Lord declaring His love for Israel. Yet the people question how He has loved them. The Lord responds by contrasting His love for Jacob with His rejection of Esau, whose descendants, the Edomites, He has laid waste. Even if Edom tries to rebuild, the Lord will demolish it again, and they will be known as a wicked land under the Lord's wrath forever. The people of Israel will witness this and acknowledge the Lord's greatness beyond their borders.

The Lord rebukes the priests for dishonoring Him. A son honors his father, and a servant respects his master, but the priests have shown contempt for the Lord's name. They offer defiled food on His altar and present blind, lame, and sick animals as sacrifices, which would not be acceptable to any governor. The Lord urges them to seek His favor so that He may be gracious to them, but He finds no pleasure in their offerings and will not accept them.

The Lord declares that His name will be great among the nations, and pure offerings will be made to Him everywhere. However, the priests have profaned His name by offering defiled sacrifices and showing disdain for the Lord's table. They bring stolen, lame, and sick animals as offerings, which the Lord will not accept. Cursed is the deceiver who promises a perfect male animal but sacrifices a blemished one instead. The Lord is a great King, and His name is to be feared among the nations.

The Lord warns the priests that if they do not honor His name, He will send a curse upon them and their blessings. He will rebuke their descendants and spread refuse on their faces from their festival sacrifices. This will make them realize that the Lord's covenant with Levi was one of life and peace, given in reverence and fear. Levi walked with the Lord in peace and uprightness, turning many from sin. The priests are supposed to preserve knowledge and teach the law, but they have turned from the way and caused many to stumble. The Lord will make them despised and humiliated because they have not followed His ways and have shown partiality in the law.

The Lord questions why the people are unfaithful to one another, breaking the covenant of their ancestors. Judah has been unfaithful, committing detestable acts in Israel and Jerusalem by marrying the daughter of a foreign god. The Lord will cut off anyone who does this, whether they are a master or a scholar, from the tents of Jacob and from presenting offerings to the Lord. The people cover the Lord's altar with tears, weeping and wailing because He no longer regards their offerings. They ask why, and the Lord responds that it is because they have been unfaithful to the wife of their youth, breaking the covenant with her. The Lord made them one, seeking godly offspring, and they should be faithful to their wives.

The Lord hates divorce and covering one's garment with violence. He urges the people to be on guard and not be unfaithful. The people have wearied the Lord with their words, questioning how they have done so. They have said that those who do evil are good in the Lord's sight and that He delights in them, or they have questioned where the God of justice is.

The Lord will send His messenger to prepare the way before Him, and the Lord they seek will suddenly come to His temple. The messenger of the covenant, whom they desire, will come. But who can endure the day of His coming? He will be like a refiner's fire and a launderer's soap, purifying the Levites like gold and silver so that they may offer righteous sacrifices to the Lord. Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the past. The Lord will come to judge, swiftly testifying against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who oppress workers, widows, and orphans, and those who deprive foreigners of justice. The Lord does not change, so the descendants of Jacob are not destroyed. They have turned away from His decrees and need to return to Him so that He will return to them.

The people ask how they can return, and the Lord responds by asking if a man can rob God. They have robbed Him in tithes and offerings and are under a curse. The Lord challenges them to bring the whole tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in His house. He promises to open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing so great that there will not be enough room to store it. He will prevent pests from devouring their crops and vines from casting their fruit. All nations will call them blessed, for theirs will be a delightful land.The Lord promises to protect your crops and ensure your vines produce fruit at the right time. All nations will call you blessed, for your land will be delightful. However, the Lord says your words have been harsh against Him. You ask, "What have we said against You?" You claim it is pointless to serve God and question the benefit of following His commands. You see the proud as happy and the wicked as successful, even those who test God seem to escape punishment.

But those who fear the Lord spoke to each other, and the Lord listened. A book of remembrance was written for those who feared the Lord and honored His name. The Lord says, "They will be mine on the day I make up my treasured possession. I will spare them as a father spares his obedient son." Then you will see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.

The day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and evildoers will be like stubble. That day will burn them up, leaving neither root nor branch. But for those who revere my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. You will go out and leap like calves released from the stall. You will trample the wicked, who will be ashes under your feet on that day.

Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel. I will send the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the hearts of the children to their parents, or else I will come and strike the land with total destruction.

The New Testament begins with the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers. Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram. Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon. Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse. Jesse was the father of King David, and David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah.

Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa. Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah. Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah. Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah. Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, and Zerubbabel the father of Abihud. Abihud was the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, and Azor the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akim, Akim the father of Elihud, and Elihud the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Messiah.

Thus, there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.

The birth of Jesus Christ happened this way: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, so he planned to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" (which means "God with us"). When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.

After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him." When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Messiah was to be born. "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written: 'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"

Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him." After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.

When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him." So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."

When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."

After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead." So he got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

In those days, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

"I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."

Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"John initially resisted baptizing Jesus, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?" But Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." So John consented. As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, heaven opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."

Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread." Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"

Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me." Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'" Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.

When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali—to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."

From that time on, Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."

As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people." At once they left their nets and followed him.

Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.

Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them. Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan followed him.

When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them. He said:

"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.

Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.

Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.' But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.

You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

And when you pray...When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to stand and pray in synagogues and on street corners to be seen by others. Truly, they have received their reward. Instead, when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 

When you pray, don't babble on like pagans, who think they will be heard because of their many words. Don't be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. 

This, then, is how you should pray: 
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen."

If you forgive others when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

When you fast, don't look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly, they have received their reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.

Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.

Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.

Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.

Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’

Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.

When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.

When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. Then Jesus said to him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”

When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?” The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.

When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.”

When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” But Jesus told him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”

Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!”"Lord, save us! We're going to drown!" Jesus replied, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the winds and the sea, and everything became calm. The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!"

When Jesus arrived on the other side, in the region of the Gadarenes, two men possessed by demons came out from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. They shouted, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?" Some distance from them, a large herd of pigs was feeding. The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs." He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town, and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.

Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own town. Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven." At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!" Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home." Then the man got up and went home. When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man.

As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?" On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?" Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."

While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live." Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. Just then, a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed." Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.

When Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him. After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. News of this spread through all that region.

As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!" When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you"; and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, "See that no one knows about this." But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.

While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel." But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons."

Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."

Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts—no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.

I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.

Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.

Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother.""A man's enemies will be those of his own household. If you love your father or mother more than me, you are not worthy of me. If you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of me. Anyone who does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.

Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.

After Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to ask him, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?' Jesus replied, 'Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.'

As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: 'What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. Whoever has ears, let them hear.

To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: "We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn." For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, "He has a demon." The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, "Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners." But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.'

Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. 'Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.'

At that time Jesus said, 'I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.'

At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, 'Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.' He answered, 'Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. Or haven't you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent? I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. If you had known what these words mean, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice," you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.'

Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?' He said to them, 'If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.' Then he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.

Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. He warned them not to tell others about him. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 'Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory. In his name the nations will put their hope.'

Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. All the people were astonished and said, 'Could this be the Son of David?' But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, 'It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.' Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, 'Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.'

Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, 'Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.' He answered, 'A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.

When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.""When an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders through dry places looking for rest but doesn't find any. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean, and put in order. Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. The final condition of that person is worse than the first. This is how it will be with this wicked generation."

While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you." He replied, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?" Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."

That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lake. Large crowds gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. He told them many things in parables, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown. Whoever has ears, let them hear."

The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?" He replied, "Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables: 'Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.' In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.' But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.

"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown."

Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' 'An enemy did this,' he replied. The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' 'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"

He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches."

He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."

Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world."

Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field." He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.

"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.

"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.

"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

"Have you understood all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they replied. He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."

When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked. "Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?" And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home." And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, and he said to his attendants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him." Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for John had been saying to him: "It is not lawful for you to have her." Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet. On Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted and had John beheaded in the prison. His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.

When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.In the evening, the disciples approached Jesus and said, "This place is deserted, and it's getting late. Send the crowd away so they can go to the villages and buy food." But Jesus replied, "They don't need to leave. You give them something to eat." The disciples responded, "We only have five loaves of bread and two fish." Jesus said, "Bring them here to me." He then instructed the crowd to sit on the grass. Taking the five loaves and two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed the food, broke it, and gave it to the disciples to distribute to the crowd. Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples collected twelve baskets full of leftovers. About five thousand men, not counting women and children, had eaten.

Immediately, Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd. After sending them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. By evening, he was alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, being tossed by the waves because the wind was against it. During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus walked on the sea towards the boat. When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."

Peter replied, "Lord, if it's you, tell me to come to you on the water." Jesus said, "Come." Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water towards Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!" Immediately, Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?" When they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."

When they crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. The people there recognized Jesus and sent word throughout the surrounding region. They brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.

Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!" Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.' But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is 'devoted to God,' they are not to 'honor their father or mother' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'"

Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand. What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them." Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?" He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."

Peter said, "Explain the parable to us." Jesus replied, "Are you still so dull? Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them."

Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly." Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us." He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel." The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said. He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs." "Yes it is, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table." Then Jesus said to her, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that moment.

Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.

Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way." His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?" "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish." He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magdala.

The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. He replied, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,' and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Jesus then left them and went away.

When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. "Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." They discussed this among themselves and said, "It is because we didn't bring any bread." Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?" They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets." "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.

From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!" Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."Jesus told his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me. Whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world but lose their soul? The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory with his angels and will reward each person according to what they have done. Some standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."

Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain. He was transfigured before them; his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light. Moses and Elijah appeared and talked with him. Peter said, "Lord, it's good for us to be here. If you wish, I'll put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." While he was speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him, I am well pleased. Listen to him!" The disciples fell facedown, terrified. Jesus touched them and said, "Get up. Don't be afraid." When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.

As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead." The disciples asked, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" Jesus replied, "Elijah does come and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him. They did to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands." The disciples understood he was talking about John the Baptist.

When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him. "Lord, have mercy on my son," he said. "He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or water. I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him." Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me." Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment. The disciples asked Jesus privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?" He replied, "Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you. But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."

While they were in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and on the third day, he will be raised to life." The disciples were filled with grief.

When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?" "Yes, he does," Peter replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes—from their own children or from others?" "From others," Peter answered. "Then the children are exempt," Jesus said. "But so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth, and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."

At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" He called a little child to him and placed the child among them. And he said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come! If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.

See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. The Son of Man came to save the lost. What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.

If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."

Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?" Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.

Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt, and let him go. But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded. His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.' But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened. Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed. This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."

When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?" "Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,' and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." "Why then," they asked, "did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?" Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery." The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry."Jesus responded, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it has been given. Some people are born as eunuchs, some are made eunuchs by others, and some choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can."

Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them, but the disciples rebuked them. Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." He placed his hands on them and then left.

A man approached Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?" Jesus replied, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments." The man asked, "Which ones?" Jesus answered, "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself." The young man said, "All these I have kept. What do I still lack?" Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth.

Jesus then said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." The disciples were astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."

Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?" Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first."

Jesus continued, "The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' So they went. He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing. About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?' 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'

When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.' The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 'These who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.' But he answered one of them, 'I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?' So the last will be first, and the first will be last."

As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!"

Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him. "What is it you want?" he asked. She said, "Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom." "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."

When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!" The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!" Jesus stopped and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked. "Lord," they answered, "we want our sight." Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.

As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away." This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: "Say to Daughter Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"

The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Hosanna in the highest heaven!" When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?" The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."

Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it 'a den of robbers.'"

The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant. "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.

Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered. When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked. Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."

Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"Jesus responded, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things. John's baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?" They discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet." So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."

Jesus continued, "What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.' The son answered, 'I will not,' but later he changed his mind and went. Then the father went to the second son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go. Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him."

"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said. But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.' So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied, "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."

Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed."

When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them. They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.

Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. He asked, 'How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?' The man was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' For many are invited, but few are chosen."

Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others because you pay no attention to who they are. Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?"

But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius, and he asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "So give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.

That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. "Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. Finally, the woman died. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"

Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. But about the resurrection of the dead—have you not read what God said to you, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living." When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"

Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."

While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied. He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.

Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.

"Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called 'Rabbi' by others. But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.

"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Therefore you will be punished more severely. Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.

"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.' You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.' You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.""Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and everything on it. And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You pay tithes of mint, dill, and cumin, but you neglect the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will also be clean.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!

You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation.

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. "Do you see all these things?" he asked. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."

As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"

Jesus answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.

Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.

If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you ahead of time.

So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.

Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.

Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.

Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.

Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.' 'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'

But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.

Later the others also came. 'Lord, Lord,' they said, 'open the door for us!' But he replied, 'Truly I tell you, I don't know you.'

Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money."The servant who received one talent dug a hole and hid his master's money. After a long time, the master returned and settled accounts with them. The one who received five talents brought five more, saying, "Master, you entrusted me with five talents; see, I have gained five more." The master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness."

The servant who received two talents also came and said, "Master, you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more." The master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness."

Then the servant who received one talent came and said, "Master, I knew you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you."

His master replied, "You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents. For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.

Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."

Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?"

The King will reply, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."

Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me."

They also will answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?"

He will reply, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."

Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.

When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, "As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. "But not during the festival," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."

While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked. "This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."

Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."

Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver. From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.

On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"

He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'" So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.

When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. And while they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."

They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely you don't mean me, Lord?"

Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."

Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely you don't mean me, Rabbi?"

Jesus answered, "You have said so."

While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body." Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."

When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."

Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."

"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."

But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.

Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."

Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."

Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter. "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."

He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."

When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.

Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"

While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him." Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.

Jesus replied, "Do what you came for, friend."

Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.

"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"

In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled."Why did you come with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal? I was teaching in the temple every day, and you didn't arrest me then. But all this happened to fulfill the writings of the prophets." Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.

Those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had gathered. Peter followed at a distance and entered the courtyard of the high priest, sitting with the guards to see what would happen.

The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so they could put him to death, but they couldn't find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward and declared, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"

Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?" But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."

"You have said so," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."

The high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?"

"He is worthy of death," they answered. Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?"

Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said. But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.

Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth." He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"

After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away." Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.

Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans to have Jesus executed. So they bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.

When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood."

"What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility." So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.

The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

"You have said so," Jesus replied.

When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?" But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.

Now it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Barabbas. So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?" For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.

While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."

But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.

"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor.

"Barabbas," they answered.

"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" Pilate asked.

They all answered, "Crucify him!"

"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.

But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"

When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"

All the people answered, "His blood is on us and on our children!"

Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified.

The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said. They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.

As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. They came to a place called Golgotha (which means "the place of the skull"). There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"

In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders mocked him. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" In the same way, the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.

From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over all the land. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" (which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?").

When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."

Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."

And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.

At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split, and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.

When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"

Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.

As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.

The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."Pilate told them, "You have a guard. Go, make the tomb as secure as you can." So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting a guard.

Early on Sunday morning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled back the stone, and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid that they shook and became like dead men.

The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. Now I have told you."

The women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings." They came to him, clasped his feet, and worshiped him. Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. The chief priests met with the elders and devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.

Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

The Gospel According to Saint Mark begins with the proclamation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As written by the prophets, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. People from all over Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, confessing their sins and being baptized in the Jordan River. John wore clothes made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He preached, "After me comes one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. A voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." Immediately, the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, and he was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.

After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people." At once they left their nets and followed him. When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. Without delay, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. Just then, a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!" "Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!" The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him." News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.

As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.

Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!" Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come." So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: "See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them." Instead, he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."

Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, "Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home." He got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"

Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.

While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?" On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."The followers of John and the Pharisees used to fast, so they asked Jesus, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?" Jesus replied, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins, otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins."

One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain. The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?" He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions." Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."

Another time, Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone." Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent. He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.

Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God." But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.

Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach and to have authority to drive out demons. These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter), James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder"), Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind." And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons." So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man's house. Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin." He said this because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit."

Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you." "Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked. Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."

Again, Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge. He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: "Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. Still, other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew, and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times." Then Jesus said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."

When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything is said in parables so that, 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'" Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? The farmer sows the word. Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. Still, others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown."

He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand? For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear." "Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."

He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it because the harvest has come."

Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth. Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade." With many similar parables, Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.

That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side." Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?" He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?""Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?" The disciples were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"

They arrived on the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gadarenes. As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him. This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. He had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and in the hills, he would cry out and cut himself with stones.

When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!" For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you impure spirit!"

Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"

"My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many." And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.

A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them." He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.

Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well. Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.

As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. Jesus did not let him but said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you." So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.

When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live." So Jesus went with him.

A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better, she grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed." Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"

"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"

But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."

While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?"

Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, "Don't be afraid; just believe." He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him.

After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means "Little girl, I say to you, get up!"). Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this, they were completely astonished. He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this and told them to give her something to eat.

Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing? Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.

Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives, and in his own home." He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. He was amazed at their lack of faith.

Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits. These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. Wear sandals but not an extra shirt. Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."

They went out and preached that people should repent. They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.

King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him." Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."

But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!" For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.

Finally, the opportune time came. On his birthday, Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."

She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?"

"The head of John the Baptist," she answered.

At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."

The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. When John's disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest." So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.

By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late. Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."The disciples suggested sending the crowd away to buy food, but Jesus told them to feed the people themselves. They asked if they should spend a large amount of money on bread. Jesus asked how many loaves they had, and they found five loaves and two fish. He instructed the crowd to sit in groups on the grass. Jesus blessed the food, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to distribute. Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they collected twelve baskets of leftovers. About five thousand men were fed.

Immediately, Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and go ahead to Bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd. Afterward, he went up a mountain to pray. Later that night, the disciples were struggling to row against the wind. Jesus walked on the water towards them, and they were terrified, thinking he was a ghost. He reassured them, saying, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." He climbed into the boat, and the wind died down. The disciples were amazed because they hadn't understood the miracle of the loaves due to their hardened hearts.

When they crossed over to Gennesaret, people recognized Jesus and brought the sick to him, hoping to touch even the edge of his cloak for healing. Wherever he went, in villages, towns, or countryside, people laid the sick in the streets, and all who touched him were healed.

The Pharisees and some scribes from Jerusalem noticed Jesus' disciples eating with unwashed hands, which they considered defiled. They questioned Jesus about why his disciples didn't follow the tradition of the elders. Jesus responded by calling them hypocrites, quoting Isaiah: "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me." He criticized them for holding human traditions over God's commandments.

Jesus then addressed the crowd, explaining that nothing outside a person can defile them; rather, it is what comes from within that defiles. Later, his disciples asked for clarification, and Jesus explained that food doesn't defile because it doesn't enter the heart but the stomach. He emphasized that evil thoughts and actions come from within and defile a person.

Jesus traveled to the region of Tyre and Sidon, where a Greek woman begged him to drive a demon out of her daughter. Jesus initially refused, saying it wasn't right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs. The woman replied that even dogs eat the children's crumbs. Impressed by her faith, Jesus healed her daughter.

Returning from Tyre, Jesus went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee and the region of Decapolis. People brought a deaf man with a speech impediment to Jesus, who healed him by touching his ears and tongue. Despite Jesus' instructions to keep it quiet, the more he insisted, the more people spread the news, amazed at his ability to make the deaf hear and the mute speak.

A large crowd gathered again, and Jesus expressed concern for their hunger after three days without food. The disciples doubted how they could feed such a crowd in a remote place. Jesus asked how many loaves they had, and they found seven. He gave thanks, broke the loaves, and distributed them. They also had a few small fish, which Jesus blessed and shared. Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they collected seven baskets of leftovers. About four thousand people were fed.

Afterward, Jesus and his disciples went to Dalmanutha. The Pharisees demanded a sign from heaven to test him. Jesus sighed deeply and said no sign would be given to this generation. He then left them and crossed to the other side of the lake.

The disciples forgot to bring bread, having only one loaf. Jesus warned them to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Herod. They misunderstood, thinking he was concerned about the lack of bread. Jesus reminded them of the miracles of feeding the five thousand and the four thousand, asking how many baskets of leftovers they collected each time. They answered correctly, but Jesus questioned why they still didn't understand.

In Bethsaida, people brought a blind man to Jesus, who healed him in stages. First, the man saw people looking like trees walking around. After Jesus laid hands on him again, his sight was fully restored. Jesus sent him home, instructing him not to go into the village.

Jesus and his disciples traveled to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked them who people said he was.The disciples answered, "Some say you are John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets." Jesus then asked, "But who do you say I am?" Peter replied, "You are the Christ." Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him. He began teaching them that the Son of Man must suffer, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and rise again after three days. He spoke openly about this, but Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, then rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind me, Satan! You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."

Jesus called the crowd and his disciples to him and said, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."

Jesus then said, "Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power." Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain, where he was transfigured before them. His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them. Elijah and Moses appeared and talked with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not know what to say, as they were so frightened. Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!" Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.

As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant. They asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected? But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."

When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. "What are you arguing with them about?" he asked. A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."

"You unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me." So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered. "It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us." "If you can?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for one who believes." Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"

When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again." The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently, and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead." But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?" He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting."

They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise." But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.

They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?" But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all." He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."

"Teacher," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us." "Do not stop him," Jesus said. "For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us. Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward."

"If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea. If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched. Everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other."

Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" "What did Moses command you?" he replied. They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away." "It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied. "But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."

When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."

People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them, and blessed them.

As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good—except God alone. You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.'" "Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy." Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor.""Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." The man was saddened by this because he had many possessions. Jesus then remarked to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" The disciples were shocked, but Jesus continued, "Children, it is very difficult for those who trust in wealth to enter God's kingdom. It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." The disciples were even more amazed and asked, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With humans, it is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."

Peter spoke up, "We have left everything to follow you!" Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, no one who has left home, family, or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age—homes, family, fields, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first."

As they were on their way to Jerusalem, Jesus led the way, and the disciples were astonished and afraid. He took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him: "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles, who will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him. Three days later, he will rise."

James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask." "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked. They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory." Jesus said, "You don't know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" "We can," they answered. Jesus said, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."

When the other ten disciples heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

As they came to Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus. A blind man named Bartimaeus was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you." Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see." "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'" They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it, some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?" They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it; he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"

Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.

On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'" The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.

In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!" "Have faith in God," Jesus answered. "Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."

They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?" Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John's baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'Of human origin'..." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.) So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."

Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed. He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. Haven't you read this passage of Scripture: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd, so they left him and went away.The Pharisees and Herodians tried to trap Jesus with his words. They asked, "Teacher, we know you're honest and teach God's way truthfully. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" Jesus, aware of their hypocrisy, asked for a coin and inquired whose image was on it. They replied, "Caesar's." Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's," leaving them amazed.

Next, the Sadducees, who deny resurrection, questioned Jesus about a woman who married seven brothers in succession, each dying without leaving children. They asked whose wife she would be in the resurrection. Jesus responded, "You are mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power. In the resurrection, people won't marry but will be like angels. God is the God of the living, not the dead."

A scribe, impressed by Jesus' answers, asked which commandment is the greatest. Jesus replied, "The most important is to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. The second is to love your neighbor as yourself." The scribe agreed, and Jesus told him he was close to God's kingdom.

Jesus then questioned how the scribes could say the Messiah is David's son when David himself called him Lord. The crowd enjoyed listening to him. He warned them about the scribes who seek honor and exploit widows, saying they would face severe judgment.

Jesus observed people giving offerings at the temple. A poor widow's small contribution impressed him more than the large amounts given by the rich because she gave all she had.

As Jesus left the temple, a disciple admired the buildings. Jesus predicted their destruction. Later, on the Mount of Olives, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked about the signs of these events. Jesus warned them about false messiahs, wars, and natural disasters, saying these were just the beginning. He cautioned them about persecution and betrayal but assured them that those who endure will be saved.

Jesus spoke of a future abomination and urged those in Judea to flee to the mountains. He described unprecedented suffering but promised that God would shorten those days for the sake of the elect. He warned against false prophets and signs, emphasizing the need for vigilance.

Jesus described cosmic disturbances and his return in glory, gathering his elect from all corners of the earth. He used the fig tree as a metaphor, indicating that when these signs appear, his return is near. He stressed that no one knows the exact time, urging them to stay alert and prepared.

Two days before Passover, the chief priests and scribes plotted to arrest and kill Jesus discreetly to avoid public unrest. While in Bethany, a woman anointed Jesus with expensive ointment, prompting criticism from some. Jesus defended her act as preparation for his burial and declared that her deed would be remembered wherever the gospel is preached.Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus. They were pleased and promised him money. Judas then looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.

On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was sacrificed, Jesus' disciples asked him where they should prepare the Passover meal. Jesus sent two disciples into the city, telling them they would meet a man carrying a water jar. They were to follow him and ask the owner of the house he entered for the guest room where Jesus could eat the Passover with his disciples. The owner would show them a large, furnished upper room. The disciples went into the city, found everything as Jesus had said, and prepared the Passover meal.

In the evening, Jesus arrived with the twelve disciples. While they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me." The disciples were saddened and began to ask him one by one, "Surely you don't mean me?" Jesus replied, "It is one of the Twelve, one who dips bread into the bowl with me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."

While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body." Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it. He said, "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God." After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

Jesus told them, "You will all fall away, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not." Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will disown me three times." But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.

They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray." He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch." Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. "Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."

Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"

Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard." Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him. The men seized Jesus and arrested him. One of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.

"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled." Then everyone deserted him and fled. A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.

They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders, and the teachers of the law came together. Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.

Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.'" Yet even then their testimony did not agree. Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?" But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.

Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?" "I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven." The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked. "You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.

While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said. But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway. When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them." Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean." He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about." Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.

Early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law, and the whole Sanhedrin, made their plans. So they bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. "Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "You have said so," Jesus replied. The chief priests accused him of many things. So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of." But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.

Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested. A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. "Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate, knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.

"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them. "Crucify him!" they shouted. "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!" Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified.

The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!" Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.

A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means "the place of the skull"). Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.At 9 a.m., they crucified Jesus. A sign above him read, "The King of the Jews." Two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left, fulfilling the scripture that said he would be counted among the lawbreakers. People passing by mocked him, shaking their heads and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself and come down from the cross!" The chief priests and teachers of the law also mocked him, saying, "He saved others, but he can't save himself. Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so we may see and believe." Even those crucified with him insulted him.

From noon until 3 p.m., darkness covered the land. At 3 p.m., Jesus cried out loudly, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" Some bystanders thought he was calling for Elijah. One of them ran, filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink, saying, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down." With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. When the centurion who stood in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"

Some women were watching from a distance, including Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. These women had followed Jesus and cared for his needs in Galilee. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.

As evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council who was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate to ask for Jesus' body. Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead. He summoned the centurion to confirm it. When he learned from the centurion that Jesus was indeed dead, he gave the body to Joseph. Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. He rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

After the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to anoint Jesus' body. Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they went to the tomb. They asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?" But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. "Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'" Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.

When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping. When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it. Afterward, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country. These returned and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either. Later, Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen. He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name, they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."

After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God. Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it. Amen.Mary visited Elizabeth, and when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, her baby leaped in her womb, and she was filled with the Holy Spirit. Elizabeth exclaimed loudly, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! Why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!"

Mary responded, "My soul glorifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on, all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for me—holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation. He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors."

Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy. On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father, Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."

They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name." Then they made signs to his father to find out what he would like to name the child. He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment, he wrote, "His name is John." Immediately, his mouth was opened, and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God. All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea, people were talking about all these things. Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.

Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them. He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he said through his holy prophets of long ago, salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us—to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant, the oath he swore to our father Abraham: to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."

The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.

In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to their own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no guest room available for them.

And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."

Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests."

When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about." So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived. When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord"), and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."

Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations: a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."

The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."

There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.

When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.

Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."

"Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?" But they did not understand what he was saying to them.

Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.

In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar...During the time when Tiberius Caesar was emperor, Pontius Pilate was the governor of Judea, Herod was the ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip ruled Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias governed Abilene. Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness. John traveled around the Jordan area, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God's salvation.'"

John addressed the crowds coming to be baptized by him, saying, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."

The people asked him, "What should we do then?" John replied, "Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same." Even tax collectors came to be baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?" "Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them. Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely—be content with your pay."

The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." And with many other words, John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.

But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.

When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you, I am well pleased."

Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim, the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them, he was hungry. The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread." Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone.'"

The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. If you worship me, it will all be yours." Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"

The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" Jesus answered, "It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.

Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day, he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: "The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."

All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked. Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'" "Truly I tell you," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown. I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years, and there was a severe famine throughout the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian."

All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.

Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath, he taught the people. They were amazed at his teaching because his words had authority. In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, "Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!" "Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What words these are! With authority and power, he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!" And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.

Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her.Jesus immediately healed Simon's mother-in-law, and she got up and began to serve them. As the sun set, people brought all their sick to Jesus, and he healed them by laying his hands on each one. Many demons were cast out, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But Jesus rebuked them and didn't let them speak because they knew he was the Messiah.

At dawn, Jesus went to a secluded place, but the people found him and tried to keep him from leaving. He told them, "I must preach the good news of God's kingdom to other towns too, because that is why I was sent." So, he continued preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

One day, as Jesus was teaching by the Lake of Gennesaret, he saw two boats at the water's edge. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. Jesus got into Simon's boat and asked him to push out a little from the shore. He sat down and taught the people from the boat. After speaking, he told Simon, "Go out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch." Simon replied, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets." They caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. They signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help, and both boats were so full they began to sink. Simon Peter fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!" He and his companions were astonished at the catch of fish. Jesus told Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people." They pulled their boats up on shore, left everything, and followed him.

In another town, a man with leprosy came to Jesus, fell on his face, and begged, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." Jesus reached out, touched him, and said, "I am willing. Be clean!" Immediately, the leprosy left him. Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone but to show himself to the priest and offer the sacrifices Moses commanded. Despite this, news about Jesus spread, and large crowds came to hear him and be healed. Jesus often withdrew to lonely places to pray.

One day, while Jesus was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law from every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem were present. The power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. Some men brought a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. When they couldn't find a way in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. Seeing their faith, Jesus said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven." The Pharisees and teachers of the law thought to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat, and go home." Immediately, the man stood up, took his mat, and went home praising God. Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God, saying, "We have seen remarkable things today."

After this, Jesus saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything, and followed him. Levi then held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. The Pharisees and teachers of the law complained to Jesus' disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?" Jesus answered, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

People asked Jesus why his disciples did not fast like John's disciples and the Pharisees. Jesus replied, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days, they will fast." He also told them a parable: "No one tears a piece from a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, 'The old is better.'"

On a Sabbath, Jesus and his disciples were walking through grainfields. His disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat the kernels. Some Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?" Jesus answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions." Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."

On another Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and was teaching. A man was there whose right hand was shriveled. The Pharisees and teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" He looked around at them all and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored. But the Pharisees and teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.

One of those days, Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray and spent the night praying to God. When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

Jesus went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there, along with a great number of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon. They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, and everyone tried to touch him because power was coming from him and healing them all.

Looking at his disciples, Jesus said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. Blessed are you when people hate you, exclude you, insult you, and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.

But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort. Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.

But to you who are listening, I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you. If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.""Love your enemies, do good to them, and lend without expecting anything back. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you—a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."

Jesus also told them this parable: "Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."

"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."

"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete."

When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. There, a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this, because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue." So Jesus went with them.

He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel." Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.

The next day, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the town was with her. When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry." Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!" The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people." This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.

John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?" When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'" At that very time, Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."

After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."

All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.

Jesus went on to say, "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by all her children."

One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.

When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner."

Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you."

"Tell me, teacher," he said.

"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"

Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven."

"You have judged correctly," Jesus said.

Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."

Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."

The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"

Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."

After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.

While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."

His disciples asked him what this parable meant. He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, 'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'"Jesus explained, "You are given the knowledge of God's kingdom, but others receive it in parables so that they may see but not perceive, and hear but not understand. The parable means this: The seed is God's word. Those along the path hear it, but the devil takes it away from their hearts to prevent belief and salvation. Those on rocky ground receive the word with joy but have no root; they believe for a while but fall away during testing. The seed among thorns represents those who hear but are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures, and do not mature. The seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart who hear the word, retain it, and produce a crop through perseverance.

No one lights a lamp and hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand so those who come in can see the light. For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known and brought to light. Therefore, consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them."

Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him but couldn't reach him because of the crowd. Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you." He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."

One day, Jesus and his disciples got into a boat, and he said, "Let's go to the other side of the lake." As they sailed, he fell asleep. A storm came down on the lake, and they were in great danger. The disciples woke him, saying, "Master, we're going to drown!" He got up, rebuked the wind and the raging waters, and the storm subsided, and all was calm. "Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement, they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."

They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee. When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time, this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house but had lived in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!" For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places.

Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.

When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.

The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, "Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.

When Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.

"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you." But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me." Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."

While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher anymore." Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed." When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child's father and mother. Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep." They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!" Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.

Jesus called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. He told them, "Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt. Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them." So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.

Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.

When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him, and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God and healed those who needed healing.

Late in the afternoon, the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging because we are in a remote place here." He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd." (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each." The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?" They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life." "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "God's Messiah." Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."

Then he said to them all, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self? Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."About eight days after these events, Jesus took Peter, John, and James up a mountain to pray. As he prayed, his appearance changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and talked with him about his upcoming departure in Jerusalem. Peter and the others were very sleepy, but when they woke up, they saw Jesus' glory and the two men standing with him. As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter suggested making three shelters for them, not fully understanding what he was saying.

While Peter was speaking, a cloud enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered it. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him." When the voice had spoken, they found Jesus alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and didn't tell anyone at that time what they had seen.

The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus. A man in the crowd shouted, "Teacher, please look at my son, my only child. A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."

Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here." Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. And they were all amazed at the greatness of God.

While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men." But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.

An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest."

"Master," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he is not one of us."

"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."

As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; but the people there did not welcome him because he was heading for Jerusalem. When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?" But Jesus turned and rebuked them. Then he and his disciples went to another village.

As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."

Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."

He said to another man, "Follow me."

But he replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."

Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."

Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family."

Jesus replied, "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."

After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.

"When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.' If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.

"When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.' I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.

"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.

"Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."

The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."

He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."

At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.

"All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."

Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."

On one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

"What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"

He answered, "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’"

"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."

But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

In reply, Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’

"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"

The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him."

Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."

As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"

"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."

One day, Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."When you pray, say: "Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us each day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil."

Then Jesus said, "Imagine you go to a friend at midnight and say, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine has come to visit, and I have nothing to offer him.' Your friend might reply, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' But I tell you, even if he won't get up and give you the bread because of friendship, he will get up because of your persistence and give you as much as you need.

So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"

Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. But some of them said, "By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons." Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.

Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe. But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first."

As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."

He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it."

As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here. The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.

No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light. Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you."

When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal. Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.

Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue, and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.

Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.

Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it."

One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also."

Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.

Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them. So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.' Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.

Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."

When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, waiting to catch him in something he might say.

Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.

I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.

Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.

I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God. But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God. And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

When you are brought before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say."

Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."

Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?" Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions."

And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'

Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink, and be merry."'

But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'

This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God."

Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!""Consider the ravens: they don't plant or harvest, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. Aren't you much more valuable than birds? Can any of you add a single hour to your life by worrying? If you can't do such a small thing, why worry about the rest? Look at how the lilies grow: they don't labor or spin, yet not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith! Don't set your heart on what you will eat or drink; don't worry about it. For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.

Don't be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."

Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"

The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.

The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.

I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed! Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."

He said to the crowd: "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does. And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is. Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don't know how to interpret this present time?

Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right? As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny."

Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish."

Then he told this parable: "A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'

'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"

On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity." Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.

Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."

The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"

When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.

Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches."

Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."

Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?"

He said to them, "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to. Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.'

But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'

Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'

But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!'

There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."

At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."

He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.' In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?" But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.

Then he asked them, "If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?" And they had nothing to say.Jesus said, "When you're invited to a wedding, don't sit in the place of honor. Someone more distinguished might have been invited, and the host will ask you to move, causing you embarrassment. Instead, sit in the least important place. Then the host will invite you to a better seat, and you'll be honored in front of everyone. Those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

He also said, "When you host a dinner, don't invite your friends, family, or rich neighbors who can repay you. Instead, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. You'll be blessed because they can't repay you, but you'll be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."

One of the guests said, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God." Jesus replied with a story: "A man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests. When it was ready, he sent his servant to tell those invited to come. But they all made excuses. One said he had just bought a field and needed to see it. Another said he had bought five yoke of oxen and was on his way to try them out. Another said he had just gotten married and couldn't come. The servant reported this to his master, who became angry and told the servant to bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. The servant did so but said there was still room. The master then told the servant to go out to the roads and country lanes and compel people to come in so that his house would be full. He declared that none of those originally invited would taste his banquet."

Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned to them and said, "If anyone comes to me and doesn't hate their father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even their own life, they cannot be my disciple. Whoever doesn't carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? If you lay the foundation and can't finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish.' Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won't he first sit down and consider whether he can oppose the other king with ten thousand men? If he can't, he'll send a delegation while the other is still far away and ask for terms of peace. In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples. Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."

Tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them." Then Jesus told them this parable: "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.' I tell you that in the same way, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.

"Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.' In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

Jesus continued, "There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them. Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country, and squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.

"When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.' So he got up and went to his father.

"But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'

"But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.

"Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked what was going on. 'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'

"The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'

"'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'"

Jesus also told his disciples, "There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. So he called him in and asked, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management because you cannot be manager any longer.'

"The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg. I know what I'll do so that when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.'

"So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'

"'Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied.

"The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.'

"Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?'

"'A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied.

"He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred.'

"The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.

"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?

"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."

The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.

"The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.

"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery."There was a rich man who dressed in fine clothes and lived in luxury every day. At his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered in sores, who longed to eat the scraps from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

One day, the poor man died and was carried by angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. He called out, "Father Abraham, have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire."

But Abraham replied, "Remember, in your lifetime you received good things while Lazarus received bad things. Now he is comforted here, and you are in agony. Besides, there is a great chasm set between us, so no one can cross over from here to you, nor can anyone cross over from there to us."

The rich man said, "Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them so they will not also come to this place of torment."

Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them."

"No, father Abraham," he said, "but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent."

Abraham said, "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."

Jesus then told his disciples, "Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. So watch yourselves. If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying 'I repent,' you must forgive them."

The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"

He replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.

"Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'? Won't he rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'? Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"

On his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!"

When he saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed.

One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.

Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?" Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well."

Once, being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is in your midst."

Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. People will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after them. For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.

"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.

"It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.

"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. Remember Lot's wife! Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it. I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."

"Where, Lord?" they asked.

He replied, "Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather."

Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said, "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'

"For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!'"

And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"

To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'

"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'

"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."

A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good—except God alone. You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'"

"All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.

When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."

When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"

Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."

Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"

"Truly I tell you," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life."

Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him; they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again."

The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.

As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.A blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard a crowd passing by, he asked what was happening. They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by." He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" The people in front told him to be quiet, but he shouted even louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"

Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" He replied, "Lord, I want to see." Jesus said, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you." Immediately, he regained his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.

Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man named Zacchaeus, a wealthy tax collector, wanted to see who Jesus was but couldn't because he was short. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was about to pass that way. When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today." Zacchaeus came down at once and welcomed him gladly.

All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a sinner." But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount." Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."

While they were listening, Jesus went on to tell them a parable because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. He said, "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. 'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.'

"But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.' He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.

"The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned ten more.' 'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. 'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'

"The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.' His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'

"Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'

"His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow? Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'

"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.' 'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!' He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.'"

After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord needs it.'"

Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?" They replied, "The Lord needs it." They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and put Jesus on it. As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.

When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen: "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"

Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!" "I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."

As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."

When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"

Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.

One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"

He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me: John's baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'Of human origin,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet." So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."

Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."

He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers, and went away for a long time. At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.

"Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.' But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. 'This is the heir,' they said. 'Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

"What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others."

When the people heard this, they said, "God forbid!"

Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'? Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed."

The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

He saw through their duplicity and said to them, "Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?" "Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."

They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.

Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.Jesus responded, "In this age, people marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of the age to come and the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage. They can no longer die; they are like the angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. Even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."

Some of the scribes replied, "Teacher, you have spoken well." And after that, they did not dare to ask him any more questions.

Then Jesus asked them, "Why do people say that the Messiah is the son of David? David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?"

While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, "Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely."

Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. "Truly I tell you," he said, "this poor widow has put in more than all the others. All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."

Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, "As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."

"Teacher," they asked, "when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"

He replied, "Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them. When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."

Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. And so you will bear testimony to me. But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death. Everyone will hate you because of me. But not a hair of your head will perish. Stand firm, and you will win life.

"When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

"There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."

He told them this parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

"Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap. For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth. Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man."

Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.

Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. They were delighted and agreed to give him money. He consented and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.

Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."

"Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.

He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there." They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.

When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God." After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me." In the same way, after the supper, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!" They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.

A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials. And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."

But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."

Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."

Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?"

"Nothing," they answered.

He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.""If you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. For I tell you, what is written about me must be fulfilled: 'He was counted among the lawless.' Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." The disciples said, "Look, Lord, here are two swords." "That’s enough," he replied.

Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation." He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down, and prayed, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done." An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. "Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."

While he was still speaking, a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?" And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.

Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns."

Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him." But he denied it. "Woman, I don’t know him," he said. A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied. About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean." Peter replied, "Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.

The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?" And they said many other insulting things to him.

At daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. "If you are the Messiah," they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer. But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God." They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You say that I am." Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."

Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king." So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "You have said so," Jesus replied. Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man." But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here."

On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort. He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. That day Herod and Pilate became friends—before this they had been enemies.

Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. Therefore, I will punish him and then release him." But the whole crowd shouted, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!" (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)

Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore, I will have him punished and then release him." But with loud shouts, they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed. So Pilate decided to grant their demand. He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.

As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!' For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"

Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One." The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself." There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!" But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don’t you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong." Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." Jesus answered him, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise."

It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.

The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man." When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.

Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body. Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.The women who had followed Jesus from Galilee saw where his body was laid and then went home to prepare spices and perfumes. They rested on the Sabbath as commanded. Early on the first day of the week, they went to the tomb with the spices they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away and Jesus' body missing. Two men in shining garments appeared and asked, "Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen!" They remembered Jesus' words and told the apostles, but they didn't believe them. Peter ran to the tomb, saw the linen cloths, and left, wondering what had happened.

Two followers were walking to Emmaus, discussing recent events. Jesus joined them, but they didn't recognize him. He asked what they were talking about, and they explained about Jesus of Nazareth, his crucifixion, and the empty tomb. Jesus called them foolish for not believing the prophets and explained the scriptures about himself. They invited him to stay with them, and during dinner, he broke bread, and they recognized him before he vanished. They returned to Jerusalem to tell the others, who confirmed that Jesus had appeared to Simon.

While they were talking, Jesus appeared and said, "Peace be with you." They were frightened, thinking he was a ghost. He showed them his hands and feet and ate with them to prove he was real. He reminded them of his teachings and opened their minds to understand the scriptures. He explained that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations. He told them to stay in Jerusalem until they received power from on high.

Jesus led them to Bethany, blessed them, and was taken up to heaven. They worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, continually praising God in the temple.

In the beginning, the Word was with God and was God. Everything was made through him. In him was life, the light of humanity, shining in the darkness. John the Baptist came to testify about the light so that all might believe. He was not the light but a witness to it. The true light was coming into the world, but the world did not recognize him. He came to his own, but they did not receive him. Those who did receive him were given the right to become children of God, born of God.

The Word became flesh and lived among us, full of grace and truth. John testified about him, saying he was greater because he existed before him. From his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace. The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has seen God, but the Son has made him known.

When priests and Levites asked John who he was, he denied being the Christ, Elijah, or the Prophet. He said he was a voice in the wilderness, preparing the way for the Lord. John baptized with water, but said one greater was coming, whose sandals he was unworthy to untie. The next day, John saw Jesus and declared him the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. He testified that he saw the Spirit descend on Jesus, confirming he is the Son of God.

Two of John's disciples followed Jesus. He asked what they wanted, and they asked where he was staying. He invited them to come and see, and they spent the day with him. One of them, Andrew, told his brother Simon, "We have found the Messiah," and brought him to Jesus, who named him Peter.Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus. He first found his brother Simon and told him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ). He brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, "You are Simon, son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which means Peter).

The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said, "Follow me." Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." Nathanael replied, "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" Philip said, "Come and see."

When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit." Nathanael asked, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you." Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel." Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that." He then added, "Very truly I tell you, you will see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."

On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus' mother was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited. When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine." Jesus replied, "Woman, why do you involve me? My hour has not yet come." His mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."

Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim. Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now." This was the first of the signs through which Jesus revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples. They stayed there for a few days. When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple courts, he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves, he said, "Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a market!" His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me."

The Jews then responded to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?" Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days." They replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?" But the temple he had spoken of was his body. After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.

While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name. But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.

Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him." Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again." "How can someone be born when they are old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born!"

Jesus answered, "Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."

"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked. "You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things? Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man. Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him."

"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God."

After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them and baptized. Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. (This was before John was put in prison.) An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."

To this John replied, "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.' The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. He must become greater; I must become less."

"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them."

Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John—although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. Now he had to go through Samaria. So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.

When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?" (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)

Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water." "Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?"

Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life."Jesus told the woman, "The water I give will become a spring inside you, leading to eternal life." The woman replied, "Sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water." Jesus said, "Go, call your husband and come back." She answered, "I have no husband." Jesus said, "You're right. You've had five husbands, and the man you're with now isn't your husband." The woman said, "Sir, I see you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim the place to worship is in Jerusalem."

Jesus replied, "Believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."

The woman said, "I know that Messiah (called Christ) is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us." Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you—I am he."

Just then, his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?" The woman left her water jar and went back to the town, telling the people, "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?" They came out of the town and made their way toward him.

Meanwhile, his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something." But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about." His disciples asked each other, "Could someone have brought him food?" Jesus explained, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Don't you have a saying, 'It's still four months until harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."

Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did." When the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words, many more became believers. They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."

After two days, Jesus left for Galilee. He himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country. When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.

Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. "Unless you people see signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe." The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies." "Go," Jesus replied, "your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed. While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him." Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and his whole household believed. This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.

Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"

"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk." At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.

The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat." But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'" So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?" The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.

Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you." The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. In his defense, Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working." For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.

Jesus gave them this answer: "Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.

"Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.

"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned. By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.

"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true.

"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.

"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me. And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

"I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?

"But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?"

After this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick.Jesus went up a mountain and sat with his disciples. The Jewish festival of Passover was near. Seeing a large crowd approaching, Jesus asked Philip, "Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?" He asked this to test Philip, knowing what he would do. Philip replied, "Even with two hundred denarii, we wouldn't have enough bread for everyone to have a little." Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, mentioned a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish, but questioned how that could help so many.

Jesus instructed the people to sit on the grassy area, and about five thousand men sat down. He took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to the people, along with the fish, as much as they wanted. After everyone was full, Jesus told his disciples to gather the leftovers so nothing would be wasted. They collected twelve baskets of leftover pieces from the five barley loaves.

The people, witnessing this miracle, said, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world." Realizing they intended to make him king by force, Jesus withdrew to a mountain alone.

That evening, the disciples went down to the sea, got into a boat, and headed toward Capernaum. It was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. A strong wind was blowing, and the sea became rough. After rowing about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water, approaching the boat, and they were frightened. But Jesus said, "It is I; don't be afraid." They welcomed him into the boat, and immediately they reached the shore where they were heading.

The next day, the crowd realized that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples and that they had left without him. Other boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after Jesus gave thanks. When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for him. When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"

Jesus replied, "You are looking for me not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him, God the Father has placed his seal of approval."

They asked, "What must we do to do the works God requires?" Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent." They asked him, "What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? Our ancestors ate manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"

Jesus said, "Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world." They said, "Sir, always give us this bread."

Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still do not believe. All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day."

The Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?"

Jesus answered, "Stop grumbling among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."

Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever." He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.

Many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?" Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you? Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life. Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them."

From this time, many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. Jesus asked the Twelve, "You do not want to leave too, do you?" Simon Peter answered, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God." Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!" (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)

After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee. He did not want to go about in Judea because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him. But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, Jesus' brothers said to him, "Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do. No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world." For even his own brothers did not believe in him.

Jesus told them, "My time is not yet here; for you any time will do. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil. You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come." After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee. However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret. Now at the festival, the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, "Where is he?" Among the crowds, there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people." But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders.

Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. The Jews there were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having been taught?" Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?" The crowd answered, "You are demon-possessed. Who is trying to kill you?" Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath? Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly."Jesus continued, "If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath to keep Moses' law, why are you angry with me for healing a man on the Sabbath? Stop judging by appearances and judge fairly."

Some people in Jerusalem said, "Isn't this the man they want to kill? Yet he's speaking openly, and no one is saying anything to him. Could it be that the authorities really think he is the Messiah? But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from."

Jesus, teaching in the temple, cried out, "Yes, you know me and where I am from. I have not come on my own, but the one who sent me is true. You do not know him, but I know him because I am from him and he sent me." They tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come. Many in the crowd believed in him, saying, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?"

The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him, so the chief priests and Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him. Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me. You will look for me, but you will not find me; where I am, you cannot come."

The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"

On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them." By this, he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time, the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.

On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet." Others said, "He is the Messiah." Still, others asked, "How can the Messiah come from Galilee? Doesn't Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?" Thus, the people were divided because of Jesus. Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.

Finally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"

"No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards replied.

"You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted. "Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? No, but this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them."

Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, "Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?"

They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."

Then they all went home, but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. At dawn, he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?" They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.

But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." Again, he stooped down and wrote on the ground.

At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"

"No one, sir," she said.

"Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."

When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life."

The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."

Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. But if I do judge, my decisions are true because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. In your own Law, it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."

Then they asked him, "Where is your father?"

"You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also." He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him because his hour had not yet come.

Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."

This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"

But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins."

"Who are you?" they asked.

"Just what I have been telling you from the beginning," Jesus replied. "I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."

They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him." Even as he spoke, many believed in him.

To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"

Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me because you have no room for my word. I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father."

"Abraham is our father," they answered.

"If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would do what Abraham did. As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. You are doing the works of your own father."

"We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."

Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."

The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"

"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death."

At this, they exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"

Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."

"You are not yet fifty years old," they said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!"

"Very truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.As Jesus was leaving the temple, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. His disciples asked, "Teacher, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"

Jesus replied, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him. We must do the works of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."

After saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. He told him, "Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing.

His neighbors and those who had seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?" Some claimed that he was, while others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he insisted, "I am the man."

"How then were your eyes opened?" they asked.

He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."

"Where is this man?" they asked him.

"I don't know," he said.

They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees. Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath. Therefore, the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.

"He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."

Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner perform such signs?" So they were divided.

Then they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened."

The man replied, "He is a prophet."

They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. "Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"

"We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind. But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself." His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had already decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."

A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God by telling the truth," they said. "We know this man is a sinner."

He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"

Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"

He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?"

Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."

The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."

To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.

Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"

"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."

Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."

Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.

Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."

Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"

Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.

"Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in by some other way is a thief and a robber. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice." Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.

Therefore Jesus said again, "Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out, and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

"I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."

The Jews who heard these words were again divided. Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?"

But others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade. The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."

Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify about me, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one."

Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"

"We are not stoning you for any good work," they replied, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."

Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are "gods"'? If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father." Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.

Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed, and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true." And in that place many believed in Jesus.

Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. (This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."

When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it." Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days, and then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."

"But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you, and yet you are going back?"

Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world's light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light."Jesus said, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him up." His disciples replied, "Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better." Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought he meant natural sleep. So he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead, and for your sake, I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him." Thomas, also known as Didymus, said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."

When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."

Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again." Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?" "Yes, Lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."

After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you." When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet entered the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.

When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. "Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied. Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"

But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"

Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. "Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days." Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"

So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me." When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!" The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."

Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation."

Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all! You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish." He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. So from that day on they plotted to take his life.

Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead, he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the festival at all?" But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.

Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages." He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. "Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."

Meanwhile, a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.

The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!" Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written: "Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt."

At first, his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him. Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him. So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"

Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus." Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.

"Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again." The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.

Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine. Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"

Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going. Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them."Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. Even though many of the leaders believed in Jesus, they wouldn't admit it because they were afraid of being expelled from the synagogue. They valued human praise more than God's approval.

Jesus then declared, 'Whoever believes in me doesn't just believe in me but in the one who sent me. When you see me, you see the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. If anyone hears my words but doesn't keep them, I don't judge them. I came to save the world, not to judge it. But there is a judge for those who reject me and don't accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them on the last day. For I didn't speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.'

Before the Passover festival, Jesus knew that his time had come to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. During the meal, the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God. So he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, 'Lord, are you going to wash my feet?' Jesus replied, 'You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.' 'No,' said Peter, 'you shall never wash my feet.' Jesus answered, 'Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.' 'Then, Lord,' Simon Peter replied, 'not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!' Jesus answered, 'Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.' For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not everyone was clean.

When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. 'Do you understand what I have done for you?' he asked them. 'You call me "Teacher" and "Lord," and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

'I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: "He who shared my bread has turned against me." I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am. Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.'

After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, 'Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.' His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, 'Ask him which one he means.' Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, 'Lord, who is it?' Jesus answered, 'It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.' Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. So Jesus told him, 'What you are about to do, do quickly.' But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.

When he was gone, Jesus said, 'Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.'

Simon Peter asked him, 'Lord, where are you going?' Jesus replied, 'Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.' Peter asked, 'Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.' Then Jesus answered, 'Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.'

'Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father's house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.'

Thomas said to him, 'Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?' Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.'

Philip said, 'Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.' Jesus answered, 'Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, "Show us the Father"? Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.

'If you love me, keep my commands. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.'

Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, 'But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?' Jesus replied, 'Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.

'All this I have spoken while still with you. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. You heard me say, "I am going away and I am coming back to you." If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me, but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. Come now; let us leave.

'I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire, and burned.'""If you stay connected to me and my teachings, you can ask for anything you want, and it will be done for you. This is how my Father is honored: when you produce much fruit and show that you are my disciples. Just as the Father has loved me, I have loved you. Stay in my love. If you follow my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have followed my Father's commands and remain in His love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. This is my command: Love each other.

If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'

When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me. And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.

I have told you this so that you will not fall away. They will put you out of the synagogues; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. I have told you this so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you, but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things. But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: about sin, because people do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.

I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.

In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me. At this, some of his disciples said to one another, 'What does he mean by saying, "In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me," and "Because I am going to the Father"?' They kept asking, 'What does he mean by "a little while"? We don't understand what he is saying.' Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 'Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, "In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me"? Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born, she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.

Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.'

Then Jesus' disciples said, 'Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.' 'Do you now believe?' Jesus replied. 'A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.'

After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: 'Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.

I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.

I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.

My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.

Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. I have made you known to them and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.'

When Jesus had finished praying, he left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley."Jesus and his disciples went to a garden across the Kidron Valley. Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, knew this place because Jesus often met there with his disciples. Judas arrived with a group of soldiers and officials sent by the chief priests and Pharisees, carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons. Knowing what was about to happen, Jesus stepped forward and asked, "Who are you looking for?" They replied, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said, "I am he." Judas, the betrayer, was standing with them. When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.

Jesus asked them again, "Who are you looking for?" They said, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go." This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me." Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"

The soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish officials, arrested Jesus and bound him. They took him first to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.

Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard, but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there, and brought Peter in. "You aren't one of this man's disciples too, are you?" she asked Peter. He replied, "I am not."

Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. Jesus replied, "I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said." When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded. Jesus replied, "If I said something wrong, testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?" Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.

Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, "You aren't one of his disciples too, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not." One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the garden?" Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.

Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?" "If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you." Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." "But we have no right to execute anyone," they objected. This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.

Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus, and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus said, "Is that your own idea, or did others talk to you about me?" Pilate replied, "Am I a Jew? Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?" Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place." "You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me." "What is truth?" retorted Pilate. With this, he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him. But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?" They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.

Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they slapped him in the face. Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him." When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!" As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him." The Jewish leaders insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die because he claimed to be the Son of God."

When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?" Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."

From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar." When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews. But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered. Finally, Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.

So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle. Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews." Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."

When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment." So this is what the soldiers did.

Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.

Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty." A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a secret follower of Jesus due to fear of the Jews, asked Pilate for permission to take Jesus' body. Pilate agreed, and Joseph took the body. Nicodemus, who had previously visited Jesus at night, brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds. They wrapped Jesus' body in linen with the spices, following Jewish burial customs. 

In the garden where Jesus was crucified, there was a new tomb where no one had been laid before. Because it was the Jewish preparation day and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there.

Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed. She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!" Peter and the other disciple ran to the tomb. The other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent over and saw the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. Then Simon Peter arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen. Finally, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.

Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot. They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" She replied, "They have taken my Lord away, and I don't know where they have put him." She turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize it was Jesus. He asked her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him." Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means "Teacher"). Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.

On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." And with that, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."

A week later, his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe." Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!" Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

Afterward, Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea of Galilee. It happened this way: Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. "I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.

Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered. He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught." So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.

When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs." Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep." The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep. Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go." Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"

Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?" When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?" Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me." Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"

This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. Amen.As Jesus ascended into heaven, the disciples watched intently. Suddenly, two men in white clothing appeared and said, "Men of Galilee, why are you staring at the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken up into heaven, will return in the same way you saw him go." 

The disciples then returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is a short walk away. They gathered in an upper room where Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon the Zealot, and Judas (son of James) were staying. They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

During this time, Peter stood up among the believers (a group of about 120 people) and said, "Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus. He was one of us and shared in our ministry. With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines spilled out. Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language 'Akeldama,' which means 'Field of Blood.' For it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, 'May another take his place of leadership.' Therefore, it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us, beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."

So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs." They cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.

When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. Suddenly, a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.

Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken. Utterly amazed, they asked, "Aren't all these who are speaking Galileans? Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!" Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?" Some, however, made fun of them and said, "They have had too much wine."

Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'

"Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. David said about him: 'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope, because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay. You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.'

"Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay. God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it. Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'

"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah."

When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"

Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call."

With many other words, he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.

They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon. Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!" So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.

Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk." Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. When all the people saw him walking and praising God, they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade. When Peter saw this, he said to them: "Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go. You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this."Peter continued, "Through faith in Jesus' name, this man whom you see and know has been made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see. Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus. Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. For Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.'

"Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days. And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your ancestors. He said to Abraham, 'Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.' When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways."

While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees came up to them. They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.

The next day the rulers, the elders, and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others of the high priest’s family. They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: "By what power or what name did you do this?"

Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: "Rulers and elders of the people! If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.' Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."

When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and took note that these men had been with Jesus. But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. "What are we going to do with these men?" they asked. "Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name."

Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John replied, "Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."

After further threats, they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.

On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. "Sovereign Lord," they said, "you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: 'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one.' Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus."

After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.

All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.

Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means "son of encouragement"), sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’ feet.

Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. With his wife’s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles’ feet. Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God."

When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.

About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?"

"Yes," she said, "that is the price."

Peter said to her, "How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also."

At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.

The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade. No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.

Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. "Go, stand in the temple courts," he said, "and tell the people all about this new life."

At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles. But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported, "We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside." On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.

Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people." At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them. The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said."You have filled Jerusalem with your teachings and are trying to make us responsible for this man's death." Peter and the other apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than human authorities. The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a cross. God exalted him to his right hand as Prince and Savior, to bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. We are witnesses of these events, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."

When the council heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill the apostles. But a respected Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, stood up and ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a moment. He then addressed the council, "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. Some time ago, Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and it all came to nothing. After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. Therefore, in the present case, I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God."

The council was persuaded by Gamaliel. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go. The apostles left the council, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.

In those days, as the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word."

This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.

So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.

Now Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia—who began to argue with Stephen. But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.

Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, "We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God." So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. They produced false witnesses, who testified, "This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us." All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

Then the high priest asked Stephen, "Are these charges true?" To this he replied: "Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. 'Leave your country and your people,' God said, 'and go to the land I will show you.'

"So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. God spoke to him in this way: 'For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated. But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.' Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.

"Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace.

"Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first visit. On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family. After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died. Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.

"As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased. Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.

"At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for by his family. When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.

"When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites. He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?' But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 'Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons.

"After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer look, he heard the Lord say: 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.

"Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.'

"This is the same Moses they had rejected with the words, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and for forty years in the wilderness.

"This is the Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.' He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.

"But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. They told Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt—we don't know what has happened to him!' That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and reveled in what their own hands had made. But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon, and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets:

"'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
    forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?
You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek
    and the star of your god Rephan,
    the idols you made to worship.
Therefore I will send you into exile' beyond Babylon.

"Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David."David found favor with God and wanted to build a temple for the God of Jacob. However, it was Solomon who built the temple. But the Most High does not live in temples made by human hands, as the prophet says: 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? Or where will my resting place be? Has not my hand made all these things?'

"You stubborn people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors did. Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him—you who have received the law given through angels but have not obeyed it."

When the people heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. "Look," he said, "I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."

At this, they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. The witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he fell asleep.

And Saul approved of their killing him. On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.

Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. So there was great joy in that city.

Now for some time, a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is rightly called the Great Power of God." They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery. But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.

When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria. When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money and said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit." Peter answered, "May your money perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! You have no part or share in this ministry because your heart is not right before God. Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."

Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me." After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about Jesus, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.

Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Go south to the road—the desert road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." So he started out, and on his way, he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means "queen of the Ethiopians"). This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet. The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."

Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked. "How can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading:

"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
so he did not open his mouth.
In his humiliation, he was deprived of justice.
Who can speak of his descendants?
For his life was taken from the earth."

The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?" Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. As they traveled along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?" And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again but went on his way rejoicing. Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.

Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"

"Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked.

"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied. "Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."

The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes, he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. For three days he was blind and did not eat or drink anything.

In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias!"

"Yes, Lord," he answered.

The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. In a vision, he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight."

"Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."

But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel. I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."

Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, and after taking some food, he regained his strength.

Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. At once, he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. All those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?" Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.

After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him, but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night, they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him and didn't believe he was truly a disciple. However, Barnabas took him to the apostles and explained how Saul had seen the Lord on his journey and had boldly preached in Damascus in Jesus' name. Saul then stayed with them, moving freely in Jerusalem and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. He debated with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they tried to kill him. When the believers learned of this, they took him to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.

The church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers.

As Peter traveled around, he visited the believers in Lydda. There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat." Immediately, Aeneas got up. All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.

In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha (also known as Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor. About that time, she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him, urging him to come. Peter went with them, and when he arrived, he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them. Peter sent them all out of the room, then got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive. This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.

In Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. One day, at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!" Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is it, Lord?" he asked. The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea." When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.

About noon the following day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds. Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat."

"Surely not, Lord!" Peter replied. "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."

The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean." This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.

While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon, three men are looking for you. So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them."

Peter went down and said to the men, "I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?"

The men replied, "We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say." Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests.

The next day, Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. But Peter made him get up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself."

While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. He said to them: "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean. So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?"

Cornelius answered: "Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us."

Then Peter began to speak: "I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right. You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached—how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil because God was with him. We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."

While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, "Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have." So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him and said, "You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them."

Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance, I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds. Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.'

"I replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'

"The voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.' This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.

"Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house. He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.'Peter continued, "As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came upon them just as it did on us at the beginning. Then I remembered what the Lord had said: 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God's way?"

When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, even to the Gentiles, God has granted repentance that leads to life."

Meanwhile, those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.

News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.

Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year, Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.

During this time, some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.

Around that time, King Herod began to persecute some members of the church. He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread. After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.

So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. "Quick, get up!" he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists.

Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and sandals." And Peter did so. "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me," the angel told him. Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.

Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen."

When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door. When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, "Peter is at the door!"

"You're out of your mind," they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, "It must be his angel."

But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this," he said, and then he left for another place.

In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed.

Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there. He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace because they depended on the king's country for their food supply.

On the appointed day, Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. They shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man." Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.

When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.

In the church at Antioch, there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch), and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.

The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.

They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, "You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun."

Immediately, mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.

From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. From Perga, they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath, they entered the synagogue and sat down. After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak."

Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: "Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power, he led them out of that country; for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness; and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance. All this took about 450 years.

"After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: 'I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.'

"From this man's descendants, God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. As John was completing his work, he said: 'Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.'

"Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.God raised Jesus from the dead, and he was seen by many who traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These people are now witnesses to the public. We are here to share the good news that God has fulfilled the promise made to our ancestors by raising Jesus, as written in the second psalm: 'You are my Son; today I have become your Father.' 

Regarding his resurrection, God said, 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.' He also said, 'You will not let your Holy One see decay.' David served God's purpose in his own time, then died and was buried, and his body decayed. But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.

Therefore, let it be known to you, brothers and sisters, that through Jesus, the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you could not obtain under the law of Moses. Be careful that what the prophets said does not happen to you: 'Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.'

As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath. When the congregation was dismissed, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.

On the next Sabbath, almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what Paul was saying, heaping abuse on him. Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: 'We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. For this is what the Lord has commanded us: "I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth."'

When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord, and all who were appointed for eternal life believed. The word of the Lord spread through the whole region. But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their region. So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed. But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders. The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles. There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them. But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country, where they continued to preach the gospel.

In Lystra, there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked. He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed, and called out, 'Stand up on your feet!' At that, the man jumped up and began to walk. When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, 'The gods have come down to us in human form!' Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker. The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.

But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: 'Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them. In the past, he let all nations go their own way. Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.' Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.

Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe. They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. 'We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,' they said. Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.

After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia, and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. From Attalia, they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed. On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.

Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: 'Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.' This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad. When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.

Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, 'The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.' The apostles and elders met to consider this question. After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: 'Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.'

The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. When they finished, James spoke up: 'Brothers, listen to me. Simon has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles. The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written: "After this, I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things"—things known from long ago.

'It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. Instead, we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood. For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.'

Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers. With them, they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings. We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.To whom we gave no such commandment: It seemed good to us, being united in agreement, to send chosen men to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things in person. It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond these essential requirements: abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.

When they were dismissed, they went to Antioch. After gathering the crowd, they delivered the letter. The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, encouraged and strengthened the believers with many words. After spending some time there, they were sent off in peace by the believers to return to those who had sent them. However, Silas decided to stay. Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others.

Some days later, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing." Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, but Paul did not think it wise to take him because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord. He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was Greek. The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was Greek. As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.

Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. During the night, Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

From Troas, we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis. From there, we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. We stayed there several days. On the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there. One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.

Once, when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved." She kept this up for many days. Finally, Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!" At that moment, the spirit left her.

When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and they are throwing our city into an uproar by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice." The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.

About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly, there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once, all the prison doors flew open, and everyone's chains came loose. The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!" The jailer called for lights, rushed in, and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household." Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized. The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.

When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: "Release those men." The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace." But Paul said to the officers, "They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out." The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.

When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. "This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah," he said. Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women. But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas to bring them out to the crowd. But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting, "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus." When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.

As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.

While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods." They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?""Can you explain this new teaching you're presenting? It sounds strange to us, and we want to understand what it means." (The Athenians and foreigners there spent their time discussing new ideas.) 

Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said, "People of Athens, I see that you are very religious. As I walked around and looked at your objects of worship, I found an altar with the inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. So, you are ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. He is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. From one man, he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. 'For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.' Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill. In the past, God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead."

When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, "We want to hear you again on this subject." At that, Paul left the Council. Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.

After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks. When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."

Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized. One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city." So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.

While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment. "This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law." Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things." So he drove them off. Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.

Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken. They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined. But as he left, he promised, "I will come back if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus. When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch. After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.

Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.

While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They answered, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." So Paul asked, "Then what baptism did you receive?" "John's baptism," they replied. Paul said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus." On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. There were about twelve men in all.

Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.

God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured, and the evil spirits left them. Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, "In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out." Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. One day the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?" Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.

When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done. A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. In this way, the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.

After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I have been there," he said, "I must visit Rome also." He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.

About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there. He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: "You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business. And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all. There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty."

When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together. Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.Paul's friends urged him not to enter the theater. The crowd was in chaos, with people shouting different things, and most didn't even know why they were there. Alexander, a Jew, was pushed forward to speak, but when the crowd realized he was Jewish, they shouted for two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"

The city clerk calmed the crowd, reminding them that everyone knew Ephesus was the guardian of Artemis and her image that fell from heaven. He advised them to stay calm and not act rashly, as the men they brought were neither temple robbers nor blasphemers. He suggested that if Demetrius and the craftsmen had a grievance, they should take it to court. He warned that the city was in danger of being accused of rioting without cause. After this, he dismissed the assembly.

After the uproar, Paul gathered the disciples, encouraged them, and left for Macedonia. He traveled through the region, giving encouragement, and then went to Greece, where he stayed for three months. When he learned of a plot against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. He was accompanied by several men, including Sopater, Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus. They went ahead to Troas and waited for Paul and his companions, who sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread and joined them in Troas five days later, staying there for seven days.

On the first day of the week, the disciples gathered to break bread, and Paul spoke to them, intending to leave the next day. He continued speaking until midnight. A young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. He fell from the third story and was picked up dead. Paul went down, threw himself on the young man, and said, "Don't be alarmed; he's alive!" Then he went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.

Paul and his companions sailed to Assos, where Paul had arranged to meet them, as he had decided to go there on foot. They took him on board at Assos and went to Mitylene. They sailed from there and arrived the next day opposite Chios. The following day they crossed to Samos, and the day after that they reached Miletus. Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, as he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.

From Miletus, Paul sent for the elders of the church in Ephesus. When they arrived, he said to them, "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, enduring the trials that came my way through the plots of the Jews. I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.

"And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace.

"Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you. For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood. I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. Even from your own number, men will arise and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them. So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.

"Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing. You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions. In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"

When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him. What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.

After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara. We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board, and set sail. After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo. We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit, they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. When it was time to leave, we left and continued on our way. All of them, including wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach, we knelt to pray. After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.

We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day. Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven. He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied. After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it, and said, "The Holy Spirit says, 'In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'"

When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. Then Paul answered, "Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, "The Lord's will be done."

After this, we started on our way up to Jerusalem. Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples. When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us warmly. The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present. Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul, "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs. What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come, so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow. Take these men, join in their purification rites, and pay their expenses so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law. As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality."Paul took the men and went through the purification rituals at the temple, signaling the end of the purification period when offerings would be made for each of them. As the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from Asia saw Paul in the temple and stirred up the crowd, accusing him of teaching against the Jewish people, the law, and the temple, and of bringing Greeks into the temple, thus defiling it. They had previously seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with Paul in the city and assumed Paul had brought him into the temple.

The whole city was in an uproar, and people seized Paul, dragging him out of the temple and shutting the doors behind them. They were about to kill him when news reached the Roman commander that Jerusalem was in chaos. The commander took soldiers and centurions and ran to the scene. When the crowd saw the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. The commander arrested Paul, bound him with two chains, and asked who he was and what he had done. The crowd shouted different accusations, and the commander, unable to get a clear answer, ordered Paul to be taken to the barracks.

As they reached the stairs, the violence of the mob was so great that the soldiers had to carry Paul. The crowd followed, shouting, "Away with him!" As Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he asked the commander if he could speak to him. The commander was surprised and asked if Paul spoke Greek, mistaking him for an Egyptian who had led a revolt. Paul clarified that he was a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city, and requested to speak to the people.

Given permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned to the crowd. When they became silent, he spoke to them in Hebrew, explaining his background. He told them he was a Jew, born in Tarsus but brought up in Jerusalem, educated under Gamaliel, and zealous for God. He recounted how he persecuted followers of "the Way" to death, arresting both men and women. He had received letters from the high priest and elders to arrest believers in Damascus and bring them to Jerusalem for punishment.

Paul described his journey to Damascus, where a bright light from heaven suddenly surrounded him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" He asked who was speaking, and the voice replied, "I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting." His companions saw the light but did not hear the voice. Paul asked what he should do, and the Lord told him to go into Damascus, where he would be told what to do. Blinded by the light, Paul was led by his companions into Damascus.

There, a devout man named Ananias, respected by all the Jews living there, came to Paul, restored his sight, and told him that God had chosen him to know His will, see the Righteous One, and hear His voice. Ananias instructed Paul to be baptized and wash away his sins, calling on the name of the Lord. Paul then returned to Jerusalem, where he had a vision in the temple, warning him to leave quickly because the people would not accept his testimony about Jesus. Paul protested, reminding the Lord of his past persecution of believers and his approval of Stephen's martyrdom. But the Lord told him to go, for He would send him far away to the Gentiles.

The crowd listened until Paul mentioned the Gentiles, then they shouted for his death, throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air. The commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks and interrogated by flogging to find out why the crowd was shouting against him. As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul asked the centurion if it was legal to flog a Roman citizen who had not been condemned. The centurion reported this to the commander, who asked Paul if he was a Roman citizen. Paul confirmed he was, and the commander, who had paid a large sum for his citizenship, was surprised to learn that Paul was born a citizen. Those who were about to interrogate Paul withdrew immediately, and the commander was alarmed that he had bound a Roman citizen.

The next day, the commander released Paul and ordered the chief priests and the Sanhedrin to assemble. He brought Paul before them to find out the exact reason he was being accused by the Jews. Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and declared that he had fulfilled his duty to God in all good conscience. The high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. Paul responded, calling Ananias a "whitewashed wall" for violating the law by ordering him to be struck. Those standing near Paul asked if he dared to insult God's high priest. Paul apologized, saying he did not realize Ananias was the high priest, citing the scripture that one should not speak evil of a ruler of the people.

Paul then noticed that some of the Sanhedrin were Sadducees and others were Pharisees. He called out that he was a Pharisee on trial because of his hope in the resurrection of the dead. This caused a dispute between the Pharisees and Sadducees, dividing the assembly. The Sadducees denied the resurrection, angels, and spirits, while the Pharisees acknowledged them all. A great uproar ensued, and some Pharisees argued that they found no fault in Paul, suggesting that perhaps a spirit or an angel had spoken to him. The dispute became so violent that the commander feared Paul would be torn apart, so he ordered the soldiers to take Paul by force and bring him into the barracks.

The following night, the Lord stood by Paul and encouraged him, saying that just as he had testified about Him in Jerusalem, he must also testify in Rome. The next morning, some Jews formed a conspiracy, vowing not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. More than forty men were involved in this plot. They went to the chief priests and elders, informing them of their oath and asking them to request the commander to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin under the pretext of gathering more information, intending to kill him before he arrived.

Paul's nephew heard about the plot and went to the barracks to inform Paul. Paul called one of the centurions and asked him to take his nephew to the commander with the information. The centurion did so, and the commander took the young man aside to hear his report. The nephew revealed the plot, and the commander instructed him not to tell anyone about their conversation.Claudius Lysias called two centurions and ordered them to prepare 200 soldiers, 70 horsemen, and 200 spearmen to escort Paul to Caesarea at 9 PM. He also arranged for animals to carry Paul safely to Governor Felix. Lysias wrote a letter to Felix explaining that Paul was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed, but he intervened upon learning Paul was a Roman citizen. He found that Paul was accused of matters related to Jewish law, but nothing deserving death or imprisonment. Learning of a plot against Paul, Lysias sent him to Felix and instructed his accusers to present their case before the governor.

The soldiers took Paul to Antipatris by night and then to Caesarea the next day, where they handed over the letter and presented Paul to Felix. Felix read the letter and asked Paul about his province, learning he was from Cilicia. Felix decided to hear Paul's case when his accusers arrived and ordered Paul to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

Five days later, the high priest Ananias, some elders, and a lawyer named Tertullus came to present their case against Paul. Tertullus praised Felix for maintaining peace and prosperity and then accused Paul of being a troublemaker, inciting riots among Jews worldwide, and leading the Nazarene sect. He also claimed Paul tried to desecrate the temple, but Lysias intervened and took Paul by force, ordering his accusers to present their case to Felix.

Paul defended himself, stating that he had only been in Jerusalem for twelve days to worship and had not caused any disturbances. He admitted to following "the Way," which his accusers called a sect, and believing in the resurrection of the dead. He explained that he came to Jerusalem to bring alms and offerings and was found purified in the temple without causing any commotion. Paul challenged his accusers to prove any wrongdoing.

Felix, familiar with "the Way," postponed the hearing until Lysias arrived. He ordered Paul to be kept under guard but allowed his friends to visit and care for him. Felix and his Jewish wife Drusilla later summoned Paul to hear about his faith in Christ. As Paul spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and dismissed Paul, saying he would call for him later. Felix hoped Paul would offer a bribe for his release and frequently conversed with him. After two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but he left Paul imprisoned to appease the Jews.

Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went to Jerusalem, where the Jewish leaders presented their case against Paul and requested he be transferred to Jerusalem, planning to ambush and kill him. Festus refused, stating Paul would remain in Caesarea and invited the leaders to present their case there. After spending more than ten days in Jerusalem, Festus returned to Caesarea and convened a court the next day, ordering Paul to be brought before him. The Jewish leaders accused Paul of many serious charges, but they could not prove them. Paul defended himself, asserting he had not violated Jewish law, the temple, or Roman law.

Festus, wanting to please the Jews, asked Paul if he was willing to go to Jerusalem for trial. Paul insisted on being tried at Caesar's court, stating he had done nothing wrong to the Jews and appealed to Caesar. Festus conferred with his council and agreed to send Paul to Caesar.

A few days later, King Agrippa and Bernice visited Festus in Caesarea. Festus discussed Paul's case with Agrippa, explaining that the Jewish leaders wanted Paul condemned, but he found no charges deserving death. Festus explained that Paul had appealed to Caesar, so he was holding him until he could send him to Rome. Agrippa expressed interest in hearing Paul, and Festus arranged a hearing for the next day.

The following day, Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great pomp, accompanied by military officers and prominent city leaders. Festus presented Paul to the assembly, explaining that the Jewish leaders demanded his death, but he found no charges deserving such a sentence. Festus admitted he was unsure what to write to Caesar about Paul and hoped Agrippa's examination would provide clarity.

Agrippa allowed Paul to speak for himself. Paul expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to defend himself before someone knowledgeable about Jewish customs and controversies. He recounted his life, stating that all Jews knew his background as a Pharisee and his strict adherence to their religion.Paul continued his defense before King Agrippa, explaining that he was being judged for his hope in the promise God made to their ancestors. He questioned why it was considered unbelievable that God could raise the dead. Paul admitted that he once opposed Jesus of Nazareth, imprisoning and persecuting many believers with the authority of the chief priests. 

He recounted his journey to Damascus, where he experienced a divine vision. At midday, a bright light from heaven surrounded him and his companions. They all fell to the ground, and Paul heard a voice in Hebrew saying, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to fight against my will." Paul asked who was speaking, and the voice replied, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and witness of what you have seen and will see of me. I will rescue you from your own people and the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, so they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those sanctified by faith in me."

Paul explained that he obeyed the vision and preached repentance and turning to God, first in Damascus, then in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, and to the Gentiles. This is why the Jews seized him in the temple and tried to kill him. With God's help, he continued to testify to everyone, saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen—that the Messiah would suffer, rise from the dead, and bring light to both Jews and Gentiles.

As Paul spoke, Festus interrupted, accusing him of being insane due to his extensive learning. Paul calmly replied that he was not insane but spoke the truth. He pointed out that King Agrippa was familiar with these events, as they were not done in secret. Paul then directly asked Agrippa if he believed the prophets, expressing confidence that he did. Agrippa responded, "Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian so quickly?" Paul replied that he wished everyone listening would become like him, except for his chains.

After Paul finished speaking, Agrippa, Festus, Bernice, and others conferred privately. They agreed that Paul had done nothing deserving death or imprisonment. Agrippa told Festus that Paul could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.

When it was decided that Paul and some other prisoners would sail to Italy, they were handed over to a centurion named Julius. They boarded a ship from Adramyttium, intending to sail along the coast of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, accompanied them. The next day, they stopped at Sidon, where Julius kindly allowed Paul to visit his friends for care.

They set sail again, navigating under Cyprus due to contrary winds. They passed through the seas of Cilicia and Pamphylia, arriving at Myra in Lycia. There, the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and transferred them onto it. They sailed slowly for many days, struggling against the wind, and eventually reached a place called Fair Havens near the city of Lasea.

As much time had passed and sailing had become dangerous, Paul warned them that the voyage would result in significant damage and loss, not only to the ship and cargo but also to their lives. However, the centurion trusted the ship's owner and pilot more than Paul's warning. Since the harbor was unsuitable for wintering, most of the crew decided to sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix, a harbor in Crete, to spend the winter.

A gentle south wind began to blow, and they thought they could achieve their plan. They set sail close to Crete, but soon a violent wind called the Northeaster struck. The ship was caught in the storm and could not head into the wind, so they let it be driven along. They passed under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, where they struggled to secure the lifeboat. They hoisted it aboard, used ropes to undergird the ship, and lowered the sea anchor to avoid running aground on the sandbars of Syrtis.

The storm continued to batter them, and they began to throw the cargo overboard. On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. The storm raged for many days, blotting out the sun and stars, and they finally gave up all hope of being saved.

After a long period without food, Paul stood before them and said they should have listened to him and not set sail from Crete, avoiding this damage and loss. He urged them to keep up their courage, assuring them that no one would lose their life, only the ship. He shared that an angel of God had appeared to him, telling him not to be afraid and that he must stand trial before Caesar. God had graciously given him the lives of all on board. Paul encouraged them to have faith in God and believe that it would happen as he had been told, although they would run aground on some island.

On the fourteenth night, as they were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, the sailors sensed they were approaching land. They took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep. A short time later, they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms deep. Fearing they would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.

Some sailors attempted to escape from the ship, lowering the lifeboat into the sea under the pretense of laying out anchors. Paul told the centurion and soldiers that unless these men stayed with the ship, they could not be saved. The soldiers cut the ropes holding the lifeboat and let it drift away.

Just before dawn, Paul urged everyone to eat, saying they had been in constant suspense and gone without food for fourteen days. He encouraged them to eat for their survival, assuring them that not a single hair from their heads would be lost. After saying this, he took bread, gave thanks to God in front of them all, broke it, and began to eat. They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. There were 276 people on board. After eating, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.

When daylight came, they did not recognize the land but saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if possible. They cut loose the anchors, left them in the sea, untied the ropes holding the rudders, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach. But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, while the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding surf.

The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any from swimming away and escaping. But the centurion, wanting to spare Paul's life, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. The rest were to follow on planks or other pieces of the ship. In this way, everyone reached land safely.

Once ashore, they learned the island was called Malta. The islanders showed them unusual kindness, building a fire and welcoming them all because it was raining and cold. Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand. When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "This man must be a murderer; though he escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."Paul shook off the snake into the fire and was unharmed. The islanders expected him to swell up or suddenly die, but when nothing happened, they changed their minds and thought he was a god.

Nearby, the chief of the island, Publius, welcomed and hosted them for three days. Publius's father was sick with fever and dysentery. Paul prayed, laid hands on him, and healed him. After this, other sick people on the island came and were healed. The islanders honored them and provided supplies when they left.

After three months, they set sail on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered on the island. They landed at Syracuse and stayed for three days, then moved on to Rhegium. A day later, a south wind helped them reach Puteoli, where they found fellow believers who invited them to stay for a week. They then continued toward Rome.

When they arrived in Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier to guard him. After three days, Paul called together the local Jewish leaders. He explained that although he had done nothing against their people or customs, he was handed over to the Romans in Jerusalem. The Romans found no reason for his death but, due to opposition from the Jews, he had to appeal to Caesar. He wanted to meet with them because of his hope in Israel.

The Jewish leaders said they had received no letters from Judea about him and had heard nothing bad about him. They were curious to hear his views because the sect he belonged to was widely spoken against. They arranged a day to meet, and many came to his lodging. Paul spoke to them about the kingdom of God and Jesus, using the Law of Moses and the Prophets from morning till evening. Some believed, while others did not.

Disagreeing among themselves, they left after Paul quoted Isaiah, saying that people would hear but not understand and see but not perceive because their hearts were hardened. Paul declared that God's salvation was sent to the Gentiles, who would listen.

Paul stayed in his rented house for two years, welcoming all who came to him. He preached about the kingdom of God and taught about Jesus Christ with confidence, without hindrance.

In his letter to the Romans, Paul introduces himself as a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God. He speaks of Jesus, a descendant of David, declared the Son of God by his resurrection. Paul received grace and apostleship to call people from all nations to faith. He addresses the believers in Rome, wishing them grace and peace from God and Jesus Christ.

Paul thanks God for their faith, known worldwide, and prays for them constantly. He hopes to visit them to share spiritual gifts and be mutually encouraged by their faith. He explains that he often planned to visit but was prevented. He feels obligated to preach to all, both Greeks and non-Greeks, wise and foolish.

Paul is eager to preach in Rome, unashamed of the gospel, which is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. He explains that God's righteousness is revealed in the gospel, and the righteous will live by faith. He warns of God's wrath against ungodliness and unrighteousness, as people suppress the truth. God's invisible qualities are evident in creation, leaving people without excuse. Although they knew God, they did not honor him and became futile in their thinking, darkening their hearts.

Claiming to be wise, they became fools, exchanging God's glory for images of created things. God allowed them to follow their sinful desires, dishonoring their bodies. They exchanged God's truth for lies, worshiping created things rather than the Creator. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts, with women and men engaging in unnatural relations, receiving due penalty for their error.

Since they did not retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a depraved mind, doing what should not be done. They were filled with all kinds of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity, becoming envious, murderous, deceitful, and malicious. They gossiped, slandered, hated God, were insolent, arrogant, boastful, and disobedient to parents. They lacked understanding, fidelity, love, and mercy. Although they knew God's righteous decree that such actions deserve death, they continued to do them and approved of others who did the same.

Paul warns that judging others while doing the same things condemns oneself. God's judgment is based on truth, and no one will escape it. God's kindness is meant to lead to repentance, but stubbornness and unrepentant hearts store up wrath for the day of judgment. God will repay each person according to their deeds, granting eternal life to those who seek glory, honor, and immortality through perseverance in doing good, but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and reject the truth. There will be trouble and distress for those who do evil, but glory, honor, and peace for those who do good, regardless of their background. God shows no favoritism.Paul continues to explain that God will judge everyone's secrets through Jesus Christ. He addresses the Jews, who take pride in the law and their relationship with God, and questions their consistency. He points out that teaching others not to steal or commit adultery while doing those things themselves dishonors God and causes His name to be blasphemed among non-Jews.

Paul argues that true circumcision is not just a physical act but a matter of the heart and spirit. He emphasizes that being a Jew is about inward transformation, not just outward rituals. He then questions the advantage of being a Jew or the value of circumcision, concluding that the Jews were entrusted with God's words. However, he asserts that unbelief does not nullify God's faithfulness.

Paul explains that God's truth stands, even if every person is a liar. He addresses the idea that human unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness, clarifying that this does not make God unjust in His judgment. He refutes the slanderous claim that they promote doing evil so that good may come, affirming that such condemnation is deserved.

He concludes that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin, quoting scriptures that declare no one is righteous or seeks God. He describes humanity's sinful nature, emphasizing that the law reveals sin but cannot justify anyone before God. Instead, righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe, as everyone has sinned and falls short of God's glory.

Paul explains that people are justified freely by God's grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus. God presented Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement, demonstrating His righteousness and justifying those who have faith in Jesus. He asserts that boasting is excluded because justification is by faith, not by observing the law. He clarifies that God is the God of both Jews and Gentiles, justifying all through faith.

Paul uses Abraham as an example, showing that he was justified by faith before he was circumcised. This makes him the father of all who believe, whether circumcised or not. The promise to Abraham and his descendants came through faith, not the law, so that it could be by grace and guaranteed to all his offspring.

Paul highlights Abraham's unwavering faith in God's promise, despite his and Sarah's old age. This faith was credited to him as righteousness, and the same applies to us if we believe in God who raised Jesus from the dead. Jesus was delivered over to death for our sins and raised to life for our justification.

Paul concludes that being justified by faith gives us peace with God through Jesus Christ. We have access to God's grace and rejoice in the hope of His glory. Even in suffering, we find hope, as suffering produces perseverance, character, and hope, which does not disappoint because of God's love poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit.

While we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly, demonstrating God's love for us. Now justified by His blood, we are saved from God's wrath. Reconciled to God through Jesus' death, we are saved by His life and rejoice in God through Jesus, through whom we have received reconciliation.

Paul explains that sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and death through sin, affecting all humanity. However, God's grace and the gift of righteousness through Jesus Christ abound even more. Just as one trespass led to condemnation for all, one righteous act leads to justification and life for all. Through Jesus, many will receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness, reigning in life through Him.Paul explains that just as one man's disobedience (Adam) led to many becoming sinners, one man's obedience (Jesus) will make many righteous. The law was introduced to highlight sin, but where sin increased, grace increased even more. Sin led to death, but grace leads to eternal life through Jesus Christ.

Paul then asks if we should continue sinning so that grace may increase. He strongly rejects this idea, stating that those who have died to sin should not live in it any longer. He explains that being baptized into Jesus Christ means being baptized into His death, and just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too should live a new life. If we are united with Him in His death, we will also be united with Him in His resurrection. Our old self was crucified with Him so that we are no longer slaves to sin. Anyone who has died is freed from sin.

If we died with Christ, we believe we will also live with Him. Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has power over Him. He died to sin once for all, but now He lives for God. Similarly, we should consider ourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, we should not let sin control our bodies or obey its desires. Instead, we should offer ourselves to God as instruments of righteousness, for sin shall not be our master since we are under grace, not the law.

Paul asks if being under grace means we can sin. He rejects this idea, explaining that we become slaves to whatever we obey—whether sin leading to death or obedience leading to righteousness. He thanks God that although we were once slaves to sin, we have now obeyed from the heart and become slaves to righteousness. Just as we once offered ourselves to impurity, we should now offer ourselves to righteousness leading to holiness. When we were slaves to sin, we were free from righteousness, but now, being freed from sin and serving God, we gain holiness and eternal life. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ.

Paul then uses the analogy of marriage to explain the law's authority. A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives, but if he dies, she is free to marry another. Similarly, we have died to the law through Christ's body so that we may belong to Him who was raised from the dead. When we were controlled by our sinful nature, the law aroused sinful passions that led to death. But now, we are released from the law and serve in the new way of the Spirit, not the old way of the written code.

Paul clarifies that the law is not sinful; it reveals sin. Without the law, he would not have known what sin was. Sin took the opportunity provided by the commandment to produce all kinds of covetous desires. The law, which was meant to bring life, brought death because sin deceived him. The law is holy, righteous, and good, but sin used what was good to bring about death, making sin utterly sinful.

Paul describes the struggle between his desire to do good and the sin living in him. He wants to do good but often does what he hates. This internal conflict shows that the law is good, but sin dwells within him. He finds that when he wants to do good, evil is right there with him. He delights in God's law but sees another law at work in his body, waging war against his mind and making him a prisoner of sin. He cries out for deliverance and thanks God for Jesus Christ, who rescues him.

Paul concludes that there is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus, who live according to the Spirit. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ has set us free from the law of sin and death. What the law was powerless to do, God did by sending His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. This fulfilled the law's righteous requirement in us, who live according to the Spirit. Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on fleshly desires, but those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. The fleshly mind is hostile to God and cannot submit to His law, but those in the Spirit belong to Christ and have life because of righteousness. The Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead will also give life to our mortal bodies.

Therefore, we are not obligated to live according to the flesh. If we live by the flesh, we will die, but if by the Spirit we put to death the misdeeds of the body, we will live. Those led by the Spirit of God are children of God. We have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father." The Spirit testifies with our spirit that we are God's children and heirs with Christ, sharing in His sufferings and glory. The present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. Creation waits eagerly for the children of God to be revealed, hoping to be liberated from decay and brought into freedom and glory. We, too, groan inwardly as we wait for our adoption and the redemption of our bodies. We are saved by hope, and the Spirit helps us in our weakness, interceding for us according to God's will. We know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. Those He foreknew, He predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that Jesus might be the firstborn among many siblings. Those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.What then shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all—how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. 

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered." No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit—I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race, the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises. Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.

It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring. For this was how the promise was stated: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son."

Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac. Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand: not by works but by Him who calls—she was told, "The older will serve the younger." Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."

What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. For Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." Therefore, God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.

One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist His will?" But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’" Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?

What if God, although choosing to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the objects of His wrath—prepared for destruction? What if He did this to make the riches of His glory known to the objects of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory—even us, whom He also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? As He says in Hosea: "I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one," and, "In the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’"

Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved. For the Lord will carry out His sentence on earth with speed and finality." It is just as Isaiah said previously: "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah."

What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal. Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the "stumbling stone." As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame."

Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.

Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: "The person who does these things will live by them." But the righteousness that is by faith says: "Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’" (that is, to bring Christ down) "or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, "Anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame." For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him, for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."

How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?" Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.

But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course, they did: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding." And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me." But concerning Israel, he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people."

I ask then: Did God reject His people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel: "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"? And what was God’s answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.

What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day." And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them. May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever."

Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!

I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.Don't be arrogant, but be cautious. If God didn't spare the natural branches, He might not spare you either. Notice both the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in His kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off. And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. If you were cut from a wild olive tree and grafted into a cultivated one, how much more will the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?

I don't want you to be unaware of this mystery, so you won't be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, and in this way, all Israel will be saved. As it is written: "The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will turn godlessness away from Jacob. And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."

Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, for God's gifts and His call are irrevocable. Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that He may have mercy on them all.

Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments, and His paths beyond tracing out! "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?" "Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?" For from Him and through Him and for Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.

Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—His good, pleasing, and perfect will.

By the grace given to me, I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.

Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with the Lord's people who are in need. Practice hospitality.

Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited. Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the Lord. On the contrary: "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head." Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. For the one in authority is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God's servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. The commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," "You shall not covet," and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.

And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.

Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters. One person's faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them. Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.

One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind. Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.

You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. It is written: "As surely as I live," says the Lord, "every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God." So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.

Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister. I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean. If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died. Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.

Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.

So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves. But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.

We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up. For even Christ did not please Himself but, as it is written: "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me." For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope. May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.Welcome one another, just as Christ welcomed you, to the glory of God. Jesus Christ served the Jewish people to confirm God's promises to their ancestors. He also extended God's mercy to the Gentiles, as it is written, "I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name." Again, it says, "Rejoice, Gentiles, with his people," and "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol him." Isaiah also says, "The root of Jesse will come, one who will arise to rule over the Gentiles; in him, the Gentiles will hope."

May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. I am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you are full of goodness, filled with knowledge, and competent to instruct one another. Yet I have written to you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

Therefore, I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God. I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ. It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation. Rather, as it is written, "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand."

This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you. But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you, I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people there. For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem. They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.

So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way. I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ. I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s people there, so that I may come to you with joy, by God’s will, and in your company be refreshed. The God of peace be with you all. Amen.

I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae. I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people, including me. Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in Christ Jesus. They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them. Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia. Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you. Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was. Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys. Greet Apelles, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus. Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord. Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord. Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the other brothers and sisters with them. Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the Lord’s people who are with them. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.

I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery, they deceive the minds of naive people. Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you, but I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil. The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.

Timothy, my co-worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow Jews. I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord. Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city’s director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith—to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.

Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, to the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge—God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you. Therefore, you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought. My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. What I mean is this: One of you says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas"; still another, "I follow Christ." Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, so no one can say that you were baptized in my name. (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.) For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.

For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.

Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him. It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness, and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: "Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord."When I came to you, I didn't use fancy words or impressive wisdom to share God's message. I focused only on Jesus Christ and His crucifixion. I was with you in weakness, fear, and trembling. My message and preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power, so your faith would rest not on human wisdom but on God's power.

We do speak wisdom among those who are mature, but not the wisdom of this world or its rulers, who are coming to nothing. We speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom that God destined for our glory before time began. None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. As it is written, "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human mind has conceived the things God has prepared for those who love Him." But God has revealed them to us by His Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

We have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for, "Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct Him?" But we have the mind of Christ.

Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans? For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere human beings?

What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. For we are co-workers in God's service; you are God's field, God's building.

By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work. If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames.

Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are that temple. Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become "fools" so that you may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness"; and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile." So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.

Think of us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.

Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other. For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?

Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign—and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you! For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings. We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored! To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless. We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.

I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children. Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. Therefore I urge you to imitate me. For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.

Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power. What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit?

It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father's wife. And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this? For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this. So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.

Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people—not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case, you would have to leave this world. But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people. What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked person from among you."

If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people? Or do you not know that the Lord's people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church? I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? But instead, one brother takes another to court—and this in front of unbelievers! The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters. Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers...None of these wrongdoers—thieves, greedy people, drunkards, slanderers, or swindlers—will inherit the kingdom of God. Some of you used to be like that, but you were cleansed, made holy, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.

While everything may be permissible for me, not everything is beneficial. I won't let anything control me. Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy both. The body is meant for the Lord, not for sexual immorality, and the Lord for the body. God raised the Lord and will also raise us by His power. Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I then take Christ's members and unite them with a prostitute? Never! Don't you know that anyone who unites with a prostitute becomes one with her? But whoever is united with the Lord is one with Him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. Other sins are outside the body, but sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you and whom you have received from God. You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore, honor God with your bodies.

Regarding the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman. But to avoid sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. I say this as a concession, not as a command. I wish all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.

To the unmarried and widows, it is good to stay unmarried, as I do. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. To the married, I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.

To the rest, I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?

Each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them. Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so. For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord's freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ's slave. You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings. Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.

Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.

What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on, those who have wives should live as if they do not; those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.

I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs—how he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband. I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.

If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.

A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that "We all possess knowledge." But knowledge puffs up while love builds up. Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know. But whoever loves God is known by God.

So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that "An idol is nothing at all in the world" and that "There is no God but one." For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"), yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.

Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, won't that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols? So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.

Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. Don't we have the right to food and drink? Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas? Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living? Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk? Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn't the Law say the same thing? For it is written in the Law of Moses: "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." Is it about oxen that God is concerned? Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? Yes, this was written for us, because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. Don't you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me.I would rather die than let anyone take away my reason to boast. Even though I preach the gospel, I can't take pride in it because it's something I must do. Woe to me if I don't preach! If I do it willingly, I have a reward; if not, I'm simply fulfilling my duty. My reward is to offer the gospel free of charge, without misusing my rights.

Though I am free, I make myself a servant to everyone to win as many as possible. To the Jews, I became like a Jew to win the Jews. To those under the law, I became like one under the law to win them. To those not having the law, I became like one not having the law to win them. To the weak, I became weak to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so I may share in its blessings.

Don't you know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that won't last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore, I don't run aimlessly; I don't fight like someone beating the air. I discipline my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I won't be disqualified.

I don't want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.

These things happened as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. Don't be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: "The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry." We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. We should not test Christ, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes. And don't grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel.

These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall. No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.

Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.

Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I don't want you to be participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he?

"I have the right to do anything," you say—but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything"—but not everything is constructive. No one should seek their own good, but the good of others. Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, for "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it."

If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience. I am referring to the other person's conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another's conscience? If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?

So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks, or the church of God—even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved. Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.

I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you. But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.

A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.

Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.

In the following directives, I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent, I believe it. No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!

For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me." In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me." For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment. Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.

So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together. Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give further directions.

Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. Therefore, I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.

There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work. Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers......to another the ability to interpret tongues. All these gifts are given by the same Spirit, who distributes them to each person as He wills.

Just as a body is one unit made up of many parts, so is Christ. We were all baptized by one Spirit into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, slaves or free, and we were all given the same Spirit to drink. The body is not made up of one part but many. If the foot says, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it is still part of the body. If the ear says, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it is still part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, how would it hear? If the whole body were an ear, how would it smell? But God has arranged the parts in the body, each one of them, just as He wanted them to be. If all were one part, where would the body be? As it is, there are many parts, but one body.

The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.

God has placed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helping, guidance, and different kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way.

If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast but do not have love, I gain nothing.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became an adult, I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.

Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging, and comfort. Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.

Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. Undoubtedly, there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.

For this reason, the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. Otherwise, when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.

I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. But in the church, I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. In the Law it is written: "With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," says the Lord. Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"

What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to themselves and to God. Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people.

Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command. But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.

Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel, you are saved if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.So, whether it was me or someone else who preached, you believed the message. Now, if we preach that Christ rose from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? If there's no resurrection, then Christ hasn't been raised either. And if Christ hasn't been raised, our preaching is useless, and so is your faith. Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we testified that He raised Christ from the dead. If the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those who have died in Christ are lost. If our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are to be pitied more than anyone else. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in turn: Christ, the first, then when he comes, those who belong to him. Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For he "has put everything under his feet." Now when it says that "everything" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.

Now, if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." Do not be misled: "Bad company corrupts good character." Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.

But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?" How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something else. But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another, and fish another. There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man.

I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: "Death has been swallowed up in victory." "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.

Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.

After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through Macedonia. Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.

When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am. No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers. Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.

Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong. Do everything in love.

You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters, to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it. I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.

The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout Achaia: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ. If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.

We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself. Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.

Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God’s grace. For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that, as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.

Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice. I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.When I planned to visit you, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner, saying "yes" and "no" at the same time? But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "yes" and "no." For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not "yes" and "no," but in Him it has always been "yes." For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "yes" in Christ. And so through Him, the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.

Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, set His seal of ownership on us, and put His Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. I call God as my witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth. Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.

So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved? I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy. For I wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.

If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent—not to put it too severely. The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient. Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.

When I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me, I still had no peace of mind because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.

But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of Him everywhere. For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. To the one, we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task? Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.

Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you? You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone. You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.

Such confidence we have through Christ before God. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was, will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness! For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!

Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away. But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into His image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

Therefore, since through God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ.

But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard-pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that His life may also be revealed in our mortal body. So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.

It is written: “I believed; therefore I have spoken.” Since we have that same spirit of faith, we also believe and therefore speak, because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to Himself. All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.

Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.

For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. Meanwhile, we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.

Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. For we live by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So we make it our goal to please Him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.

Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience. We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart. If we are “out of our mind,” as some say, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for Him who died for them and was raised again.

So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.We then, as co-workers with God, urge you not to receive His grace in vain. For He says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is the time of God's favor; now is the day of salvation.

We strive to give no cause for offense in anything, so that our ministry will not be discredited. Instead, in everything we do, we show ourselves as servants of God: in great endurance, in troubles, hardships, and distresses; in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights, and hunger; in purity, understanding, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors; known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed; sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.

We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you. We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.

Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." Therefore, "Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." And, "I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."

Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.

Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one. I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you. I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.

For when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn—conflicts on the outside, fears within. But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.

Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it—I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while—yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. So even though I wrote to you, it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are. By all this we are encouraged.

In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well. And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling. I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.

And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches. In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord’s people. And they exceeded our expectations: They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us. So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part. But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you—see that you also excel in this grace of giving.

I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.

And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so. Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.

Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, as it is written: "The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little."

Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you. For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative. And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel. What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help. We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift. For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man.

In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you. As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ. Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.

There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord’s people. For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action. But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be. For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to say anything about you—would be ashamed of having been so confident. So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.

Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. As it is written: "They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever."

Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord’s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else. And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you. Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!

Now I, Paul, appeal to you by the humility and gentleness of Christ—I who am "timid" when face to face with you, but "bold" toward you when away! I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.We live in the world, but we don't fight with worldly methods. Our weapons are powerful through God, capable of breaking down strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to make it obedient to Christ. We are ready to punish any disobedience once your obedience is complete.

Do you judge by appearances? If anyone is confident they belong to Christ, they should consider that we belong to Christ just as much. Even if I boast a little too much about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I won't be ashamed. I don't want to seem like I'm trying to scare you with my letters. Some say my letters are weighty and forceful, but in person, I'm unimpressive, and my speaking amounts to nothing. Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.

We don't dare classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise. We will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you. We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ. Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand, so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. We do not want to boast about work already done in someone else's territory. But, "Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord." For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.

I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with me! I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.

I do not think I am in the least inferior to those "super-apostles." I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!

And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.

I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. In this self-confident boasting, I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face. To my shame, I admit that we were too weak for that!

Whatever anyone else dares to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers. I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?

If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.

I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows. And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows—was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses. Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say, or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing. I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders, and miracles. How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!

Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less? Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery! Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you? I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit?

Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening. For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder. I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin, and debauchery in which they have indulged.

This will be my third visit to you. "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return, I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others, since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God's power we will live with him in our dealing with you. Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?"Don't you realize that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you fail the test? I hope you will see that we have not failed. We pray to God that you do no wrong—not so we can appear approved, but so you can do what is right, even if we seem to have failed. We can't do anything against the truth, only for it. We are glad when we are weak but you are strong, and we pray for your perfection. I write this while absent so that when I am present, I won't have to be harsh, using the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not tearing you down.

Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All God's people here send their greetings. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

Paul, an apostle—not sent from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—and all the brothers and sisters with me, to the churches in Galatia: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—which is really no gospel at all. Evidently, some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!

Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.

For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.

Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days. I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother. I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. They only heard the report: 'The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.' And they praised God because of me.

Fourteen years later, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain. Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.

As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message. On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised. For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles. James, Cephas, and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised. All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along.

When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, 'You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?'

We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.

For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!'"You are all one in Christ Jesus, regardless of gender. If you belong to Christ, you are Abraham's descendants and heirs according to the promise. An heir, while still a child, is no different from a servant, even though they are the future owner of everything. They are under guardians and managers until the time set by their father. Similarly, when we were children, we were enslaved by the basic principles of the world. But when the right time came, God sent His Son, born of a woman and under the law, to redeem those under the law so we could be adopted as His children. Because you are His children, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, prompting us to call out, "Abba, Father." So, you are no longer a servant but a child, and if a child, then an heir through God.

Previously, when you didn't know God, you were enslaved to things that are not gods. But now that you know God—or rather, are known by God—why are you turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you want to be enslaved by them again? You are observing special days, months, seasons, and years. I fear for you, that my efforts for you might have been wasted. I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You have not wronged me at all. You know it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you. Even though my illness was a trial for you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?

Those people are zealous to win you over, but not for good. They want to alienate you from us so that you may have zeal for them. It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you. My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!

Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise. These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written: "Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband." Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. At that time, the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. But what does Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son." Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.

Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. Again, I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.

You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth? That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. "A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough." I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty. Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case, the offense of the cross has been abolished. As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!

You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.

So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.

Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ. If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves. Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else, for each one should carry their own load. Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.

Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.

See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand! Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh. May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation. Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.

From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to God’s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love, he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will—to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. In him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.

In him, we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.

For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God’s people, I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.I pray that your hearts will be enlightened so you can understand the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance among the saints, and the incredible greatness of His power for us who believe. This is the same mighty power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenly realms, far above any ruler, authority, power, or leader, not only in this world but also in the one to come. God has put all things under Christ's feet and appointed Him to be the head over everything for the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.

You were once dead because of your sins and disobedience, following the ways of this world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit now at work in those who are disobedient. We all used to live like that, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like everyone else, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

Remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (which is done in the body by human hands)—remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, by setting aside in His flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in Himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which He put to death their hostility. He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. For through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.

Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of His household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone. In Him, the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in Him, you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by His Spirit.

For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles, surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you, that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets. This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.

I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of His power. Although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people, this grace was given to me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, according to His eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In Him and through faith in Him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence. I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.

For this reason, I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray that out of His glorious riches He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.

Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever! Amen.

As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. But to each one of us, grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says: "When He ascended on high, He took many captives and gave gifts to His people." (What does "He ascended" mean except that He also descended to the lower, earthly regions? He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) So Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors, and teachers, to equip His people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of Him who is the head, that is, Christ. From Him, the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed. That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ and were taught in Him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body. "In your anger do not sin": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold. Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But among you, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. For of this, you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness)."Live in a way that pleases the Lord. Don't participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness; instead, expose them. It's shameful to even mention what some do in secret, but everything exposed by the light becomes visible. That's why it says, 'Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.' Be careful how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. Don't be foolish but understand what the Lord's will is. Don't get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior. As the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to Himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—for we are members of His body. 'For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.' This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise—'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.' Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.

Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free. And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.

Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore, put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people. Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.

Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing. I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you. Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.

Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all God's holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me. God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.

Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear. It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this, I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, for I know that through your prayers and God's provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.

Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together with one accord for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God. For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him but also to suffer for Him, since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.

Therefore, if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:

Who, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be used to His own advantage;
rather, He made Himself nothing
by taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
He humbled Himself
by becoming obedient to death—
even death on a cross!
Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place
and gave Him the name that is above every name,
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.

Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill His good purpose. Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, 'children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.' Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky.""Shine like lights in a dark world. Hold on to the word of life, so I can be proud on the day of Christ that my efforts were not in vain. Even if I am poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. You should also be glad and rejoice with me.

I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so I can be cheered by news about you. I have no one else like him, who genuinely cares for your welfare. Everyone else looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. But you know Timothy’s proven character, how he has served with me in the gospel like a son with his father. I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.

I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. He longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. Indeed, he was ill and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. Therefore, I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.

Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.

But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.

Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. Only let us live up to what we have already attained.

Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends! I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers, whose names are in the book of life.

Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.

I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength. Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.

Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.

To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings. All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."I am a servant of the church, working to fulfill God's word. This mystery, hidden for ages, is now revealed to His saints. God wants to make known the glorious riches of this mystery among the Gentiles: Christ in you, the hope of glory. We preach Christ, warning and teaching everyone with wisdom, to present everyone perfect in Christ. I work hard, relying on His power working in me.

I want you to know how much I struggle for you and those in Laodicea, and for all who haven't met me personally. My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so they may have the full riches of complete understanding, knowing the mystery of God, namely Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. I tell you this so no one deceives you with fine-sounding arguments. Though I am absent in body, I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.

As you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him, rooted and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. Be careful not to be taken captive by hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. For in Christ, all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.

In Him, you were also circumcised, not with a physical procedure, but with the circumcision done by Christ, having been buried with Him in baptism and raised with Him through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and stood opposed to us; He took it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.

Therefore, do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration, or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind. They have lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.

Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: "Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"? These are all destined to perish with use, based on human commands and teachings. Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, false humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.

Since you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.

Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.

Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.

Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism.

Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven. Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.

Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord. I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts. He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here. My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.) Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me. Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured. I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis. Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings. Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea. Tell Archippus: "See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord." I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you. We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers. We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that He has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake. You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.

You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results. We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you His gospel in the face of strong opposition. For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.We were entrusted by God to share the gospel, and we speak to please God, not people, because He examines our hearts. We never used flattery or sought personal gain; God is our witness. We didn't seek praise from you or anyone else, even though, as apostles of Christ, we could have been a burden. Instead, we were gentle with you, like a caring nurse with her children. We loved you so much that we were delighted to share not only the gospel but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.

You remember our hard work and toil; we worked night and day to avoid being a burden while we preached the gospel to you. You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless we were among you who believed. You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children, encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into His kingdom and glory.

We continually thank God because when you received the word of God from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe. You became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus. You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone, hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way, they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.

Brothers and sisters, when we were separated from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing, we made every effort to see you. We wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, did, again and again—but Satan blocked our way. For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when He comes? Is it not you? Indeed, you are our glory and joy.

When we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens. We sent Timothy, our brother and co-worker in God's service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith, so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we are destined for them. In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know. For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain.

But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you. Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution, we were encouraged about you because of your faith. For now, we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord. How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you? Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.

Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you. May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you. May He strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all His holy ones.

Finally, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more. For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus. It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before. For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you His Holy Spirit.

Now about your love for one another: we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. And in fact, you do love all of God's family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.

Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him. According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words.

Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him. Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.

Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else. Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not treat prophecies with contempt but test them all; hold on to what is good, reject every kind of evil.

May God Himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and He will do it. Brothers and sisters, pray for us. Greet all God's people with a holy kiss. I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We always thank God for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love all of you have for one another is increasing. Therefore, among God's churches, we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring. All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result, you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His might on the day He comes to be glorified in His holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you.

With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of His calling, and that by His power He may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith. We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.We urge you, brothers and sisters, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering to Him, not to be easily unsettled or alarmed by any prophecy, report, or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come. Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the one doomed to destruction. He will oppose and exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God. Don’t you remember that when I was with you, I used to tell you these things? And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of His mouth and destroy by the splendor of His coming. The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. For this reason, God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.

But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter. May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who loved us and by His grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope, encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.

Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not everyone has faith. But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one. We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command. May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.

In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.”

We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies. Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat. And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good. Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter. Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed. Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer.

Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you. I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, to Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by faith. The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk. They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.

We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which He entrusted to me.

I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that He considered me trustworthy, appointing me to His service. Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason, I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His immense patience as an example for those who would believe in Him and receive eternal life. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well, holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.

I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession, and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. And for this purpose, I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.

Therefore, I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with propriety.

Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.

In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.

Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.

The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.In the later times, some people will abandon their faith and follow misleading spirits and teachings from demons. They will speak lies with hypocrisy, having their conscience seared as with a hot iron. They will forbid marriage and demand abstinence from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. Every creation of God is good and should not be rejected if received with gratitude, for it is sanctified by God's word and prayer.

If you remind the brothers and sisters of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of faith and good teaching that you have followed. Avoid godless myths and old wives' tales; instead, train yourself to be godly. Physical training has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance. We labor and strive because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially those who believe. Command and teach these things.

Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young. Set an example for the believers in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity. Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching, and to teaching. Do not neglect your gift, which was given to you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you. Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them so that everyone may see your progress. Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.

Do not rebuke an older man harshly but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity. Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and ask for help. But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. Give the people these instructions so that no one may be open to blame. Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble, and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds. As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. Thus, they bring judgment on themselves because they have broken their first pledge. Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes, and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan. If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.

The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. For Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and “The worker deserves his wages.” Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning. I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality and to do nothing out of favoritism. Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.

The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever.

All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered. Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves. These are the things you are to teach and insist on.

If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions, and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.

Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way, they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.

Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, to Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. For this reason, I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love, and self-discipline. So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. And of this gospel, I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.

You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.

You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.Endure hardships like a dedicated soldier of Jesus Christ. A soldier doesn't get tangled up in everyday affairs; they focus on pleasing their commander. Similarly, athletes must compete according to the rules to win. Farmers who work hard should be the first to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Reflect on these teachings, and may the Lord give you understanding.

Remember Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, who was raised from the dead. This is my gospel, for which I suffer, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. I endure everything for the sake of the chosen ones, so they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with Him, we will also live with Him. If we endure, we will also reign with Him. If we disown Him, He will disown us. If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot disown Himself.

Remind everyone of these things and warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value and only ruins those who listen. Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are His," and "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."

In a large house, there are articles not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use. Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master, and prepared to do any good work.

Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.

Understand this: In the last days, terrible times will come. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.

They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.

You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them. In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of His appearing and His kingdom, I give you this charge: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction. For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.

For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me but also to all who have longed for His appearing.

Do your best to come to me quickly, for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.

Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. You too should be on your guard against him because he strongly opposed our message. At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory forever and ever. Amen.

Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters. The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all. Amen.

Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time, and which now, at His appointed season, He has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior. To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you. An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. Since an overseer manages God's household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.

For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group. They must be silenced because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain. One of Crete's own prophets has said it: "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons." This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth. To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. They claim to know God, but by their actions, they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for doing anything good.

You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine. Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love, and in endurance. Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands so that no one will malign the word of God. Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. In everything, set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness, and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.

Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.The grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to everyone. It teaches us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this present age. We look forward to the blessed hope—the glorious return of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for Himself a people eager to do good works. Speak these things, encourage and correct with all authority. Don't let anyone disregard you.

Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready for every good work. They should not slander anyone, avoid fighting, and be gentle, showing true humility to everyone. We were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, He saved us—not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior. So, having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs with the hope of eternal life. This is a trustworthy saying, and I want you to stress these things so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.

Avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, arguments, and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. Warn a divisive person once, and then a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them. You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.

When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there. Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need. Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives.

Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker, also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers because I hear about your love for all His holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. Your love has given me great joy and encouragement because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people.

Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you. I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.

So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self. I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.

And one more thing: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.

Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom also He made the universe. The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After He had provided purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. So He became as much superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is superior to theirs.

For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"? Or again, "I will be His Father, and He will be my Son"? And again, when God brings His firstborn into the world, He says, "Let all God's angels worship Him." In speaking of the angels He says, "He makes His angels spirits, and His servants flames of fire." But about the Son He says, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has set You above Your companions by anointing You with the oil of joy." He also says, "In the beginning, Lord, You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment, they will be changed. But You remain the same, and Your years will never end." To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet"? Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?

We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard Him. God also testified to it by signs, wonders, and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.

It is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is mankind that You are mindful of them, a son of man that You care for him? You made them a little lower than the angels; You crowned them with glory and honor and put everything under their feet." In putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present, we do not see everything subject to them. But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because He suffered death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.

In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what He suffered. Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. He says, "I will declare Your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly, I will sing Your praises." And again, "I will put my trust in Him." And again He says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."

Since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity so that by His death He might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. For surely it is not angels He helps, but Abraham's descendants. For this reason, He had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that He might make atonement for the sins of the people. Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.

Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest. He was faithful to the one who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future. But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are His house if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory."Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as you did during the rebellion, during the time of testing in the wilderness. Your ancestors tested and tried me, and for forty years they saw what I did. That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.' So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"

Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end. As has just been said: "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."

Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? And to whom did God swear that they would never enter His rest if not to those who disobeyed? So we see that they were not able to enter because of their unbelief.

Therefore, since the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed. Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'" And yet His works have been finished since the creation of the world. For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "On the seventh day God rested from all His works." And again in the passage above He says, "They shall never enter my rest."

Therefore, since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience, God again set a certain day, calling it "Today." This He did when a long time later He spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted: "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts." For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works, just as God did from His. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.

For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet He did not sin. Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.

In the same way, Christ did not take on Himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to Him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father." And He says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek." During the days of Jesus' life on earth, He offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverent submission. Son though He was, He learned obedience from what He suffered and, once made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.

We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand. In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.

Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, instruction about cleansing rites, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. And God permitting, we will do so.

It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age and who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss, they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to public disgrace. Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end, it will be burned.

Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case—the things that have to do with salvation. God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you have shown Him as you have helped His people and continue to help them. We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized. We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.

When God made His promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for Him to swear by, He swore by Himself, saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants." And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised. People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of His purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, He confirmed it with an oath. God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.

This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him, and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace." Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.

Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham. This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. And without doubt, the lesser is blessed by the greater. In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by Him who is declared to be living. One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.

If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also. He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar. For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life. For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."

The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless (for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God. And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath, but He became a priest with an oath when God said to Him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind: 'You are a priest forever.'" Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.Jesus became the guarantee of a better covenant. Unlike the many priests who couldn't continue their service due to death, Jesus holds an eternal priesthood. He can save completely those who come to God through Him because He always lives to intercede for them. Such a high priest meets our needs—holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. Unlike other high priests, He doesn't need to offer sacrifices daily for His own sins and then for the people's sins. He did this once for all when He offered Himself. The law appoints men who are weak as high priests, but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.

The main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human. Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. If He were on earth, He would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain." But in fact, the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which He is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.

If there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. But God found fault with the people and said: "The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more." By calling this covenant "new," He has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.

The first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.

When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning. This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.

But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, He went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!

For this reason, Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that He has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep." In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; He entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. Nor did He enter heaven to offer Himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. Otherwise, Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But He has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself. Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.

The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason, it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. Then I said, 'Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—I have come to do your will, my God.'"

First, He said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them"—though they were offered in accordance with the law. Then He said, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God, and since that time He waits for His enemies to be made His footstool. For by one sacrifice He has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.

The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First, He says: "This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds." Then He adds: "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more." And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.

Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, His body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.If someone rejected the law of Moses, they faced death without mercy based on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse do you think it will be for someone who has trampled on the Son of God, treated the blood of the covenant as unholy, and insulted the Spirit of grace? We know God has said, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay," and "The Lord will judge His people." It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

Remember the earlier days after you received the light, when you endured a great struggle full of suffering. Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times, you stood side by side with those who were so treated. You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions in heaven. So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised. For, "In just a little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay." And, "But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back." But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.

Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for. By faith, we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. By faith, Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith, he was commended as righteous when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith, Abel still speaks, even though he is dead. By faith, Enoch was taken from this life, so he did not experience death; he could not be found because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. And without faith, it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.

By faith, Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith, he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith. By faith, Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith, he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. And by faith, even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered Him faithful who had made the promise. And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.

All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had the opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.

By faith, Abraham, when tested, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, even though God had said to him, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.

By faith, Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt because he was looking ahead to his reward. By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw Him who is invisible. By faith, he kept the Passover and the application of blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. By faith, the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land, but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. By faith, the walls of Jericho fell after the army had marched around them for seven days. By faith, the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.

And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets, who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted, and mistreated—the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.

These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect. Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinners so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And you have completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son: "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when He rebukes you because the Lord disciplines the one He loves, and He chastens everyone He accepts as His son." Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as His children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best, but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in His holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. "Make level paths for your feet," so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed. Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness, no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. See that no one is sexually immoral or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son. Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done.

You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom, and storm; to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them because they could not bear what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death." The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear." But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel."See to it that you don't ignore the one who speaks. If those who ignored the message on earth didn't escape, how much less will we if we turn away from the one who speaks from heaven? His voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, 'Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.' This means that the things that can be shaken will be removed, so that what cannot be shaken will remain. 

Since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.

Keep loving each other as brothers and sisters. Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing so some people have entertained angels without knowing it. Remember those in prison as if you were together with them, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.

Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.' So we say with confidence, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?'

Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so.

We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat. The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore. For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.

Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.

Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.

Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way. I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.

Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you quite briefly. I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you. Greet all your leaders and all the Lord’s people. Those from Italy send you their greetings. Grace be with you all. Amen.

James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings.

Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.

Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position. But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away like a wildflower. For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.

Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him. When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.

Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.

My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.

Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at their face in a mirror and, after looking at themselves, goes away and immediately forgets what they look like. But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.

Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, 'Here’s a good seat for you,' but say to the poor man, 'You stand there' or 'Sit on the floor by my feet,' have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?

Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?

If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, 'Love your neighbor as yourself,' you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, 'You shall not commit adultery,' also said, 'You shall not murder.' If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.

Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

But someone will say, 'You have faith; I have deeds.' Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.

You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. And the scripture was fulfilled that says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,' and he was called God’s friend. You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.

In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.

Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check. When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go."The tongue is a small part of the body, but it can boast about great things. Just like a small spark can start a huge fire, the tongue can cause a lot of harm. It can corrupt the whole body and set one's life on a destructive path. While humans have tamed all kinds of animals, no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it, we praise our Lord and Father, and with it, we curse people who are made in God's likeness. This should not be so. Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? Can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.

Who among you is wise and understanding? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in humility that comes from wisdom. But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. Such "wisdom" does not come from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic. For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice. But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.

What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. Don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us? But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble." Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn, and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it but sitting in judgment on it. There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?

Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money." Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that." As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them.

Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.

Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near. Don’t grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door! Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job’s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.

Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple "Yes" or "No." Otherwise, you will be condemned.

Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years. Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.

My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.You are coming to Christ, the living cornerstone, rejected by people but chosen and precious to God. You, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. Scripture says, "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame." To you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone," and "A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall." They stumble because they disobey the message, which is also what they were destined for.

But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.

Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves. Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.

Slaves, in reverent fear of God, submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth." When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." For "you were like sheep going astray," but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight. For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.

Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.

Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. For, "Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech. They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."

Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened." But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits—to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities, and powers in submission to him.

Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin. As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you. But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.

The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray. Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.

Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And, "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?" So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.

To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed: Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.

In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble." Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.

Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings. And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.

With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God.The church in Babylon, chosen along with you, sends greetings, as does my son Mark. Greet each other with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

The Second Letter of Peter

From Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: May grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord.

God's divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness. Through these, He has given us His very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.

For this reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. If you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble, and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body, because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.

We did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased." We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with Him on the sacred mountain.

We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed, these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.

For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment; if He did not spare the ancient world when He brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; and if He rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority.

Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord. But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals, they too will perish.

They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood! They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer, who loved the wages of wickedness. But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.

These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for “people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.” If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and, “A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.”

Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking. I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.

Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ He promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.” But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.

But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead, He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.

Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. But in keeping with His promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.

So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless, and at peace with Him. Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.

Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

The First Letter of John

That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. We write this to make our joy complete.

This is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have...If we claim to have a relationship with God but live in darkness, we are lying and not living in the truth. But if we live in the light, as God is in the light, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make God out to be a liar, and His word is not in us.

My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. We know that we have come to know Him if we keep His commands. Whoever says, "I know Him," but does not do what He commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. But if anyone obeys His word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in Him: Whoever claims to live in Him must live as Jesus did.

Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in Him and in you because the darkness is passing, and the true light is already shining. Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness. Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble. But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going because the darkness has blinded them.

I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name. I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.

Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.

Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.

As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. And this is what He promised us—eternal life. I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. As for you, the anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in Him.

And now, dear children, continue in Him so that when He appears, we may be confident and unashamed before Him at His coming. If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of Him.

See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. All who have this hope in Him purify themselves, just as He is pure.

Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. But you know that He appeared so that He might take away our sins. And in Him is no sin. No one who lives in Him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen Him or known Him.

Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as He is righteous. The one who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work. No one who is born of God will continue to sin because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning because they have been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister.

For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another. Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil, and his brother’s were righteous. Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. We know that we have passed from death to life because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death. Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in them.

This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in His presence: If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and He knows everything. Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from Him anything we ask because we keep His commands and do what pleases Him. And this is His command: to believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as He commanded us. The one who keeps God’s commands lives in Him, and He in them. And this is how we know that He lives in us: We know it by the Spirit He gave us.

Dear friends, do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us, but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.

Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God because God is love. This is how God showed His love among us: He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.

This is how we know that we live in Him and He in us: He has given us of His Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son to be the Savior of the world. If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they in God. And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.

God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world, we are like Jesus. There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. We love because He first loved us. Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. And He has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.

Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves His child as well. This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out His commands.To show our love for God, we must follow His commandments, which are not burdensome. Those born of God overcome the world through faith. Who overcomes the world? Only those who believe Jesus is the Son of God. Jesus came by water and blood, and the Spirit testifies to this truth. There are three that testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and they are one. On earth, the Spirit, the water, and the blood testify, and they agree.

If we accept human testimony, God's testimony is greater, for it is the testimony of His Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God has this testimony in their heart. Those who do not believe God have made Him out to be a liar because they have not believed the testimony God has given about His Son. This testimony is that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.

I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know you have eternal life. We have confidence in approaching God, knowing that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. If we know He hears us, we know we have what we asked of Him.

If you see a fellow believer committing a sin that does not lead to death, pray, and God will give them life. There is a sin that leads to death; I am not saying you should pray about that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.

We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. We know we are children of God, and the whole world is under the control of the evil one. We also know that the Son of God has come and given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true. We are in Him who is true by being in His Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.

The Second Epistle of John:

The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not only I but also all who know the truth—because of the truth that lives in us and will be with us forever: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love.

I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. And this is love: that we walk in obedience to His commands. As you have heard from the beginning, His command is that you walk in love.

Many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. Be careful not to lose what we have worked for, but to be rewarded fully. Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.

I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.

The Third Epistle of John:

The elder, to my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth. Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well. It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.

Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, even though they are strangers to you. They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God. It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans. We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth.

I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us. So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.

Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God. Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.

I have much to write to you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink. I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.

The Epistle of Jude:

Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, to those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: Mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.

Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy people. For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.

Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord at one time delivered His people out of Egypt but later destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these He has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day. In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.

In the same way, these people—who claim authority from their dreams—defile the flesh, reject authority, and heap abuse on celestial beings. But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.

Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion. These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice dead. They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.

Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of His holy ones to judge everyone and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.” These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.

But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. They said to you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.” These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.

But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. Be merciful to those who doubt; save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.

To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before His glorious presence without fault and with great joy—to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.

The Revelation of John:

The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John, who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it because the time is near.John, writing to the seven churches in Asia, sends grace and peace from God, who is eternal, and from the seven Spirits before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness and ruler of the kings of the earth. Jesus loves us and freed us from our sins by His blood, making us a kingdom of priests to serve God. To Him be glory and power forever. Amen.

Look, He is coming with the clouds, and everyone will see Him, even those who pierced Him. All peoples on earth will mourn because of Him. So shall it be. Amen.

"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."

John, your brother and companion in suffering and in the kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. On the Lord's Day, I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, which said: "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."

I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me. When I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to His feet and with a golden sash around His chest. His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In His right hand, He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.

When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. Then He placed His right hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades. Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now, and what will take place later. The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."

To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands. "I know your deeds, your hard work, and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false. You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name and have not grown weary. Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first. Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place. But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."

To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of Him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again. "I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death."

To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of Him who has the sharp, double-edged sword. "I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives. Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality. Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it."

To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze. "I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first. Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching, she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling. So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways. I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds. Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets, 'I will not impose any other burden on you, except to hold on to what you have until I come.' To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations—that one 'will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery'—just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give that one the morning star. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of Him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. "I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God. Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you. Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life but will acknowledge that name before my Father and His angels. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of Him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What He opens, no one can shut; and what He shuts, no one can open. "I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth. I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have so that no one will take your crown. The one who is victorious, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God's creation. "I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so you can become rich, and white clothes to wear so you can cover your shameful nakedness, and salve to put on your eyes so you can see. Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.""I correct and discipline those I love. So be eager to change your ways and repent. Look, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with them, and they with me. To those who overcome, I will grant the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I overcame and sat with my Father on His throne. Let anyone who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.

After this, I saw a door open in heaven, and the first voice I heard sounded like a trumpet, saying, 'Come up here, and I will show you what must happen next.' Immediately, I was in the Spirit, and there was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. The one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby, and a rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne. Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders dressed in white with golden crowns on their heads. From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing, which are the seven spirits of God. Also in front of the throne, there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.

In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures covered with eyes, in front and in back. The first creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle. Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night, they never stop saying, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.' Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say, 'You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.'

Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?' But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. Then one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.'

Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne. And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people. And they sang a new song, saying: 'You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood, you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.'

Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. In a loud voice, they were saying: 'Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!' Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: 'To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, forever and ever!' The four living creatures said, 'Amen,' and the elders fell down and worshiped.

I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, 'Come!' I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 'Come!' Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword. When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, 'Come!' I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, 'Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!' When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, 'Come!' I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. They called out in a loud voice, 'How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?' Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, were killed just as they had been. I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. They called to the mountains and the rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?'

After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea, 'Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.' Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel. From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000, from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000, from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000, from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.

After this, I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice: 'Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.' All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying: 'Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen!' Then one of the elders asked me, 'These in white robes—who are they, and where did they come from?' I answered, 'Sir, you know.' And he said, 'These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence. Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.'"When the seventh seal was opened, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then, I saw seven angels standing before God, each given a trumpet. Another angel came with a golden censer, filled it with incense and the prayers of the saints, and offered it on the golden altar before the throne. The smoke of the incense, along with the prayers, rose before God. The angel then filled the censer with fire from the altar and threw it to the earth, causing thunder, lightning, and an earthquake.

The seven angels prepared to sound their trumpets. The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown to the earth, burning up a third of the trees and all the green grass. The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge burning mountain was thrown into the sea, turning a third of it into blood, killing a third of the sea creatures, and destroying a third of the ships.

The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star, burning like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and springs. The star was called Wormwood, and it made a third of the waters bitter, causing many people to die from the bitter water. The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun, moon, and stars were struck, darkening a third of the day and night.

I then saw an eagle flying in midair, crying out, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the remaining trumpet blasts!"

The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven to earth, given the key to the bottomless pit. When it opened the pit, smoke rose like from a great furnace, darkening the sun and air. Locusts came out of the smoke, given power like scorpions. They were told not to harm the grass, plants, or trees, but only those without God's seal on their foreheads. They were allowed to torment people for five months, but not kill them. The pain was like a scorpion's sting, and people sought death but couldn't find it.

The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle, with crowns of gold, human-like faces, women's hair, lions' teeth, iron breastplates, and wings sounding like many chariots. They had tails with stingers like scorpions, and their king was the angel of the bottomless pit, named Abaddon in Hebrew and Apollyon in Greek.

The first woe passed, but two more were to come. The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the golden altar before God, telling the sixth angel to release the four angels bound at the Euphrates River. These angels, prepared for a specific time, were released to kill a third of humanity. The number of mounted troops was two hundred million.

In my vision, the horses and riders had fiery red, dark blue, and yellow breastplates. The horses' heads were like lions, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came from their mouths, killing a third of humanity. Their power was in their mouths and tails, which were like serpents with heads that inflicted harm.

Despite these plagues, the survivors did not repent of their evil deeds, idol worship, murders, sorceries, sexual immorality, or thefts.

I then saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars. He held a little open scroll and placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land. He cried out like a roaring lion, and seven thunders responded. I was about to write what they said, but a voice from heaven told me to seal it up and not write it down.

The angel raised his hand to heaven and swore by the eternal Creator that there would be no more delay. When the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, God's mystery would be completed, as He had announced to His prophets.

The voice from heaven spoke to me again, telling me to take the open scroll from the angel. I did, and the angel told me to eat it. It tasted sweet as honey in my mouth but turned my stomach bitter. The angel then told me I must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.

I was given a measuring rod and told to measure God's temple, the altar, and the worshipers, but to exclude the outer court given to the Gentiles, who would trample the holy city for forty-two months. God would empower His two witnesses to prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth. They are the two olive trees and lampstands before the Lord. If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths to devour their enemies. They have the power to shut the sky, turn water to blood, and strike the earth with plagues as often as they wish.

When they finish their testimony, the beast from the bottomless pit will wage war against them, conquer, and kill them. Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where Jesus was crucified. People from all nations will see their bodies for three and a half days and refuse to bury them. The inhabitants of the earth will celebrate their death, sending gifts to each other because the two prophets had tormented them.

After three and a half days, God will breathe life into them, and they will stand up, terrifying those who see them. A loud voice from heaven will call them up, and they will ascend in a cloud while their enemies watch. At that moment, a great earthquake will strike, killing seven thousand people and causing the survivors to give glory to God.

The second woe has passed, and the third is coming soon. The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and loud voices in heaven proclaimed, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and His Messiah, and He will reign forever and ever." The twenty-four elders worshiped God, thanking Him for His eternal reign and judgment.The temple of God in heaven was opened, revealing the ark of His covenant. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.

A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. Another sign appeared: a huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven crowns on its heads. Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman, ready to devour her child the moment it was born. She gave birth to a son, who will rule all nations with an iron scepter. Her child was snatched up to God and His throne. The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared by God, where she would be taken care of for 1,260 days.

There was a war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But the dragon was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon, the ancient serpent called the Devil or Satan, who leads the whole world astray, was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. A loud voice in heaven said, "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short."

When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time, out of the serpent's reach. Then from his mouth, the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God's commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.

The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, "Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?"

The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months. It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander His name and His dwelling place and those who live in heaven. It was given power to wage war against God's holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation. All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.

Whoever has ears, let them hear. "If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed." This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God's people.

Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.

Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 who had His name and His Father's name written on their foreheads. And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.

Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship Him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the springs of water."

A second angel followed and said, "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries."

A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: "If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, they, too, will drink the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of His wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name." This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep His commands and remain faithful to Jesus.

Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them."

I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand. Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to Him who was sitting on the cloud, "Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe." So He who was seated on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.

Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe." The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes, and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath. They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.

I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God's wrath is completed. And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God and sang the song of God's servant Moses and of the Lamb: "Great and marvelous are Your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are Your ways, King of the nations. Who will not fear You, Lord, and bring glory to Your name? For You alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been revealed."The temple in heaven was opened, and seven angels came out, dressed in pure white linen with golden sashes. One of the four living creatures gave them seven golden bowls filled with God's wrath. The temple was filled with smoke from God's glory and power, and no one could enter until the seven plagues were completed.

A loud voice from the temple instructed the angels to pour out the bowls of God's wrath on the earth. The first angel poured his bowl, causing painful sores on those who had the mark of the beast and worshipped its image. The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, turning it into blood and killing all sea life. The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs, turning them into blood. The angel of the waters declared God's judgment as just, for those affected had shed the blood of saints and prophets.

The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, causing it to scorch people with intense heat. Despite their suffering, they cursed God and refused to repent. The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast, plunging its kingdom into darkness, causing people to gnaw their tongues in agony and curse God for their pains and sores, without repenting.

The sixth angel poured his bowl on the Euphrates River, drying it up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. Three evil spirits resembling frogs came from the mouths of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. These spirits performed miracles and gathered the kings of the world for battle on the great day of God Almighty, at a place called Armageddon.

The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air, and a loud voice from the temple declared, "It is done!" Thunder, lightning, and a massive earthquake followed, splitting the great city into three parts and causing the cities of the nations to collapse. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of His wrath. Every island and mountain disappeared, and huge hailstones fell from the sky, causing people to curse God due to the severity of the plague.

One of the seven angels with the bowls spoke to me, showing me the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries. In the wilderness, I saw a woman on a scarlet beast covered with blasphemous names, with seven heads and ten horns. She was dressed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls, holding a golden cup filled with abominations and impurities. On her forehead was written: "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." She was drunk with the blood of the saints and the martyrs of Jesus.

The angel explained the mystery of the woman and the beast she rides. The beast once was, now is not, and will come up from the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names are not written in the book of life will be astonished when they see the beast. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits, and they represent seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. The beast is an eighth king, belonging to the seven, and is going to its destruction. The ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but will receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour. They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and with Him will be His called, chosen, and faithful followers.

The waters where the prostitute sits represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. The ten horns and the beast will hate the prostitute, bring her to ruin, and burn her with fire. God has put it into their hearts to accomplish His purpose by agreeing to give their power to the beast until His words are fulfilled. The woman is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.

After this, I saw another angel coming down from heaven with great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. He proclaimed, "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!" She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit. All nations have drunk the wine of her adulteries, and the kings of the earth have committed adultery with her. The merchants of the earth have grown rich from her excessive luxuries.

Another voice from heaven called, "Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins or receive her plagues. Her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Give her a double portion from her own cup. She glorified herself and lived in luxury, so give her as much torment and grief. In her heart, she boasts, 'I sit enthroned as queen. I am not a widow; I will never mourn.' Therefore, in one day, her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning, and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her."

The kings of the earth who committed adultery with her will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her burning. The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn because no one buys their cargoes anymore. The cargoes include gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet cloth, every sort of citron wood, articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble; cargoes of cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, and human beings sold as slaves. The merchants will lament the loss of their wealth, standing far off in fear of her torment, crying out, "Woe! Woe to the great city, dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones, and pearls! In one hour, such great wealth has been brought to ruin!"

Every sea captain, all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea will stand far off. When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, "Was there ever a city like this great city?" They will throw dust on their heads and cry out, "Woe! Woe to the great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour, she has been brought to ruin!" Rejoice over her, you heavens! Rejoice, you people of God! Rejoice, apostles and prophets! For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you.

A mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "With such violence, the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again."Babylon will be completely destroyed and never found again. The sounds of music, craftsmanship, and daily life will cease. The light of a candle and the voices of weddings will no longer be heard. The merchants, who were once powerful, deceived all nations with their sorcery. In Babylon, the blood of prophets, saints, and all who were killed on earth was found.

After this, I heard a great multitude in heaven shouting, "Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, honor, and power belong to our God, for His judgments are true and just. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality and avenged the blood of His servants." They shouted again, "Hallelujah! The smoke from her destruction rises forever."

The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!" A voice from the throne said, "Praise our God, all His servants, those who fear Him, both small and great." Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and loud thunder, shouting, "Hallelujah! For the Lord God Almighty reigns. Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready. Fine linen, bright and clean, was given to her to wear." (The fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.)

The angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!" And he added, "These are the true words of God." I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said, "Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus."

I saw heaven standing open, and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice, He judges and wages war. His eyes are like blazing fire, and on His head are many crowns. He has a name written on Him that no one knows but He Himself. He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is the Word of God. The armies of heaven, dressed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. Coming out of His mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron scepter. He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. On His robe and on His thigh, He has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.

I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, "Come, gather together for the great supper of God, so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small."

Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and His army. But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs, he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.

I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the Abyss and a great chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.

I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.

When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number, they are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city He loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

I saw a great white throne and Him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from His presence, and there was no place for them. I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.

Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."

He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then He said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true." He said to me, "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty, I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God, and they will be My children. But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters, and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."

One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." He carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west. The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates, and its walls. The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be twelve thousand stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long. The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick. The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.

I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.The city didn't need the sun or the moon to shine on it because God's glory illuminated it, and the Lamb was its light. The saved nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. The gates will never close during the day, and there will be no night there. The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. Nothing impure, nor anyone who does shameful or deceitful things, will enter it—only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.

Then, an angel showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and the Lamb. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and the Lamb will be in the city, and His servants will serve Him. They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign forever and ever.

The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent His angel to show His servants the things that must soon take place." "Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll."

I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me. But he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God!"

Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near. Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy."

"Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star."

The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let the one who hears say, "Come!" Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.

I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.

He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.

The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen.
