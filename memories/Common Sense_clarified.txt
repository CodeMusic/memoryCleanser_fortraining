### Common Sense, by Thomas Paine (1776)

#### Introduction

The ideas in these pages might not be popular yet, but time changes minds more than reason does. When power is abused for a long time, people start questioning its legitimacy. The people of this country, oppressed by the combination of the King and Parliament of England, have the right to question and reject both.

The author has avoided personal attacks. The wise and worthy don't need pamphlets to triumph, and those with misguided sentiments will change on their own. The cause of America is the cause of all humanity. The principles of freedom and justice are universal, and the fight against oppression concerns everyone.

#### Postscript to Preface in the Third Edition

The publication of this edition was delayed to address any attempts to refute the doctrine of independence. No such attempts have appeared, so it is presumed none will. The author's identity is irrelevant; the focus should be on the doctrine itself.

#### I. Of the Origin and Design of Government in General, with Concise Remarks on the English Constitution

Some writers confuse society with government, but they are different. Society is created by our needs and promotes happiness by uniting us. Government, on the other hand, is created by wickedness and restrains our vices. Society is a blessing, but government is a necessary evil at best and an intolerable one at worst.

In a state of natural liberty, people would form societies to help each other. As they overcome initial difficulties, they would establish a government to maintain order. The first laws would be simple regulations enforced by public disapproval. As the society grows, they would elect representatives to manage public concerns.

The English constitution is complex and flawed. It combines the remains of monarchical and aristocratic tyranny with some republican elements. The King and the peers are independent of the people and contribute nothing to freedom. The idea that the three powers check each other is absurd. The King has too much power, and the constitution is designed to keep the people in check.

#### II. Of Monarchy and Hereditary Succession

Humanity was originally equal, and distinctions like rich and poor can be explained without resorting to oppression and avarice. However, the distinction between kings and subjects has no natural or religious justification. Monarchy was introduced by heathens and copied by the Israelites. It promotes idolatry and is condemned by scripture.

The Jews requested a king to be like other nations, but this was a rejection of their true sovereign, the Lord. Monarchy is a sin, and the history of kings is filled with oppression and corruption. Hereditary succession is even worse, as it perpetuates the rule of unworthy individuals. The origin of kings is often dishonorable, and their claim to power is based on force and deceit.

#### III. Thoughts on the Present State of American Affairs

The struggle between England and America is not just about a city or a country, but a continent. The appeal to arms was chosen by the King, and the continent has accepted the challenge. The cause is just, and the time for debate is over. Reconciliation with Britain is impossible and undesirable. The connection with Britain brings more harm than good, and America would be better off independent.

The argument that America has flourished under British rule is fallacious. America would have thrived even more without European interference. Britain's protection was motivated by self-interest, not attachment. The idea of Britain as the parent country is a manipulative lie. Europe, not England, is the true parent of America.

#### IV. Of the Present Ability of America, with Some Miscellaneous Reflections

The time for independence has come. America has the strength and resources to defend itself. The continent has a large and disciplined army, and its natural resources make it capable of building a powerful navy. The present circumstances are ideal for establishing a government. The fewer our numbers, the more land is available for future generations.

The present time is unique and should not be wasted. Most nations miss the opportunity to form their own government and end up receiving laws from conquerors. America must seize this moment to create a government that protects freedom and property. A Continental Charter should be established to secure the rights of all.

In conclusion, the cause of independence is just and necessary. The present time is the right time to establish a government that ensures freedom and security for future generations. The struggle for independence is not just for America, but for the principles of liberty and justice that concern all humanity.
